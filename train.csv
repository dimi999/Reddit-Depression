dsf,"I'm brand-new here at these forums. I've come to you all to seek guidance/wisdom from any of you who has suffered or is currently suffering from depression. Within the past 3 years I have struggled on and off with this disease. For the most part I've had it under control, until relatively recently. About four months ago I was drastically descending downwards mental health wise. The result of this declination helped obstruct all aspects of my social life, causing an abrupt, painful end to many friendships I endeared. Also my negative behavior started to poison. The equilibrium that my family and I shared. The result of all this lead not only to my choice of isolation , but even if I chose not to isolate myself, I still had damaged relationships so much, that any attempts to make amends, and or repair former friendships, were futile. I basically pushed and alienated myself from everything I held dearest. Anyways, one day I just snapped; my ability to process information, perform simple math equations, remember things I had JUST thought of seconds before, concentrate, quick wit, and confident decision making had all been impaired immensely. Previously, before all of this, I was an ""A"" Honor Role student and had no difficulty functioning efficiently in my ""AP"" classes, but now I can barely sustain a low ""B"" average. Has anyone experienced this lack of cognition? If so, do you know if it will go away? Its driving me insane!"
dsf,"This is a great topic. It looks like people associate with what was shared. I was laughing a little because for awhile I was so hypersensitive to sound I would not even consider turning anything on that created noise, even the noise from lights was too much. I used to go to a counselor who had a radio on in her waiting room. I could not stand it and used to turn it off. Then someone would turn it back on, having no understanding of what it was like to be me at that moment. That's funny to me now. I still don't like noise but I'm lucky since I have pretty good control over my environment. For awhile I was working in cubicles and was not sure I was going to make it. The one comment I wanted to share was what I experienced when I did turn the TV back on, read the newspaper, listened to the radio. I went without it for two years. What I experienced was the way the news was presented. I was captivated not by the words or circumstances of stories, but the tone of voice, the selection of what sound bites to use, the background chosen for a shot. I'm still fascinated by all that and even dreamed the other night I had been hired to be that person who decides how to present something. In my dream I was having a moral dilemma. My integrity is important to me and, in my dream, I was talking to my boss and trying to explain the emotional angst I was in. She kept saying, give them what they want, who are you to decide what is best for them. I woke up before I decided to quit or stay. But those words stayed with me through a day, who am I to decide what's best for someone else? What I do now is selectively listen to the news. I like NPR and sometimes enjoy McNeil Lehrer. I find if someone is expressing a strong opinion I will get annoyed if the presentation does not also include an opposing viewpoint. My main issue is selective presentation. I feel disrespected if someone is asking me to just trust them. I want to know what are the observations leading to a conclusion. I want to know what level of uncertainty there is. I don't like anyone telling me how to think or feel. I'm perfectly capable of creating all the drama I could ever use, on my own. I'm not clear where to place blame for all the drama the industry of information puts out there. I know someone is to blame. If only I could find that person or group then my hatred would be perfect. I'm kidding about that last sentence. I'm just trying to get a rise out of someone reading my share--I'm being frisky. I support public broadcasting and free speech. If I was in charge meetings would last forever because everyone would get a chance to speak. Wouldn't it be great if there truly was free speech in America. Wouldn't it be great if the principle of dissent was truly an American ideal. Isn't it supposed to be?"
dsf,"Hello, i am a 24 year old male. this is my 3rd time joining this forum... i joined once, had to resign in because it moved form .com to .org (or something) then i took medicines, was feeling better and kind of stopped coming here... now i feel bad again. :( i think this forum is a great resource... the people who started it should be quite proud of themselves... if i started something that touched this many people, at the mindsets that were at... maybe i wouldn't be depressed anymore. my 1 complaint, as i have mentioned b4... i think it is wrong to make people post 5 times b4 they are allowed  to create a thread... when people are here, feeling depressed, sometimes, (i would assume) suicidal... they should be allowed to post new threads right away. However, i don't mean to complain, as i do feel this is a great resource, and it's more then I've done to help the less fortunate in the world... good luck everyone."
dsf,"Hello all. My name is Daniel I'm 23 and going to school in Bowling Green, Ohio. I've been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, ADD, and depression. I've tried various medicines for my ADD and the last one I was on was Effexor XR, usually used to treat depression but can be used for adult ADD, I was on it for a year or two and kept increasing the dosage b/c I wasn't seeing enough results. The medicine dosage got too high and I had a break down during the summer of 05. To vent I would cut myself and eventually attempted suicide in a Kroger parking lot. I went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed medicines, but I've grown tired of using medicines; I had a seizure while on a drug for acne. I refused to take the medicines and have been struggling with killing myself every day. I don't really like going into public due to my social anxiety and tend to turn to computer games to escape reality. I drink more caffeine than is healthy, don't sleep at night, and have fluctuations in eating. I never think I am good at anything, I built a computer last night which kind of made me feel good about myself, but that's not enough. I've stopped going to class because I don't think I'm good enough and haven't told anyone. I'm pretty much a wreck right now and am in the process of going to the counseling center that my school offers. I don't know how much longer I can hold out before I try something else. I am struggling to even be happy around my friends, family and girl friend. They all know I think about it every day, but never say anything. It's probably because I hide my feelings and lie to them about it. I don't want to even keep going to school it feels so pointless. My girl friend wants to get married I don't even want to think about it. I don't want to get married and am too gutless to tell her. I have feelings of breaking up with her but once again I'm to scared and gutless to say anything. I hate myself."
dsf,"Hi i am a 34 mum of 5 kids i had severe postnatal depression 8years ago and was sent to a ""special hospital""(that's what my kids call it ciz it helped mummy get better) for a week. i was on depressants 4 nearly 4 years .

dsf,"No one has a monopoly on suffering.  We keep living our lives because depression is pain and illness is suffering, but both don't happen without something happening to us.
It is at these times that we are changing in some way...Suffering can give us greater empathy and understanding.  It can strip away all the other stuff. 
So many say they will always be depressed ... that may or may not be the case but everyone has right to live their lives ... suffering included. 
However, there is a vast difference between simply suffering from depression and finding the courage to live with long term / cyclical depression.  You can, learn to live with depression.  It may profoundly change your life ... take much away from you, but you can learn to live with it.  Long term depression isn't static ... like any illness, it changes.  But we know depression is different because it so cruelly takes away our hope of a brighter future.  But be stubborn and it will change again.
To state in a forum like this, that you want to end it all is a big responsibility to place on the shoulders of other people.  It hands the possibility of that personal choice on to others .... which is unfair.
Genuine suffering can bring more empathy and awareness of the plight of others in similar situations.
There are times when i feel like ending my life and the thoughts nudge at me constantly but I recognize them now for what they are: the depression talking.  With each episode I have learnt new ways to try and tag these thoughts.  Ultimately ... the illness is happening to me / the thoughts happen to me.  But I would not burden others with the knowledge of their presence.  It is only afterwards that i might mention that i had these constant thoughts, because to tell them in the middle of the depression would only darken their lives as much as the depression is darkening my own.
Please think before you make threats of suicide in the chat room or forums.  There is an increasing number of people using this technique of gaining attention but it is unfair.  by all means we can talk about it .... but saying : ""i'm going to do it."" is simply selfish and smacks of attention seeking.
Such behavior is destroying the integrity of genuine sufferers of depression in the eyes of so many.  It is eroding the help which is so lacking for so many ... and is probably the reason why the mental health hospital near me is a relic from the 60's and yet the cancer department is brand new and state of the art.
Please .... stop attention seeking and stop using ""depression"" as a convenient coat hanger for emotional immaturity and lack of personal responsibility.
For so many people ... this really is a matter of life and death."
dsf,"Well I'm new here so here goes nothing.

I have been diagnosed clinically depressed, along with obsessive compulsive disorder.  I'm 32 years old.   I've been divorced once and have since re - married.  I have 2 children, 7 year old boy (stepson) and 4 1/2 year old girl.  I work for a state government agency repairing computers.

So far so good right?  Well the major problems I'm having is becoming a social recluse.  I have a REALLY hard time ""letting things go"".  In 2005, I lost both my sister (suicide) and my father (heart attack), and those events only added to the trauma I'd been going through.  I live in a small town, so when I went to the doctor about possible ADHD (i was moody, couldn't focus on work, couldn't complete tasks on time etc), they determined I was bipolar and put me on Effexor and Wellbutrin.  Well that just did absolutely nothing.  In fact my anger with the world increased dramatically and I had rage episodes that about destroyed my second marriage.  I've had a lot of rage in the past.  Recently I haven't had any outbursts.  I'm currently taking Cymbalta and Celexa and that seems to be a good combination.   But I still have a hard time going to work, and functioning throughout the day.  I'd rather stay at home, in my bedroom, away from people most of the time.  That's what bothers me.  I'm on antidepressants, but it doesn't seem to help me get motivated to face the world.  Does that come from within?  Is there no magic pill that will all of a sudden make me feel confident? 

I guess that's good enough for now.  I have a ton of mental history but don't want to flood anybody."
dsf,"I am new to this so please bear with me.  I don't even know where to begin.  With all of  
the tragedy going on in our gulf coast as well as the war, I feel I have no right to be  
unhappy but I am 24 / 7.

I am 37 years old and have made a complete mess of my life.  My parents were raised in  
Europe and came to the states in their 20's.  I have a younger brother who also has  
depression but it differs from my own.  When I look back at my childhood all I feel is  
pain and neglect and I can't recall any happy memories.  I don't believe that I was ever  
physically abused however, I do think that I was ignored and emotionally neglected.   
Perhaps that is why I manage to make a mess of my life every time things seem to be going  
well.  I'm married and have a 4 year old son.  From all outward appearances, my life comes  
across as perfect (although we all know there is no such thing).

I have been seeing psychiatrists and therapists since I was 17 and have tried to commit  
suicide on four separate occasions.  My mother suffers from depression and her mother did  
as well.  This is such a long and complicated story and I don't know how much I am allowed  
to write or if anyone is even interested since this is my first try in any type of chat  
room.  My interior pain lies so far deep that I don't sleep, hardly eat and feel miserable  
all the time.

I guess that is all I will say for now."
dsf,"We were all given about five minutes to decipher what the fuck this meant. Now, Mr. Runge had a reputation for being a tough teacher. He wouldn't let you get away with ANYTHING. If you fell asleep in his class because you were out all night in some cornfield with a bonfire and a bottle of Jack, he'd kick your desk in such a way that your head would fly upward at warp speed and your hangover would instantly get very very bad, and then suddenly disappear. Mr. Runge had some freaky special power that students couldn't tap into. I knew what the acronym stood for. But that's only because my high school boyfriend was a year ahead of me and gave me a heads up on how the first day with the Jolly Green Giant would play out. ""He's going to write this on the board, make you feel incredibly stupid and then it will be over."" TINSTAAFL, pronounced TinStaffel. There Is No Such Thing As A Free Lunch. Runge went on to explain that ""free"" didn't exist. The ""free"" lunches at college tours were paid for when your parents registered you were charged a ""service"" fee. Or, more on my level, Clinique never REALLY has a ""Free Gift with Purchase"". Because, you see...you have to make the purchase, dumb ass! And they over charge every other product just enough so that you're really paying for your ""free"" gift. This burst my bubble. Because now, whenever I take something marketed as free, I know I'm paying some sort of overhead or some poor schmuck is working extra hard so that I can get 2.5 ounces more of my favorite shampoo for the price of the regular size! You would think that I would have held on to this knowledge while looking for apartments. While scanning the ads, I bypassed the ones that used words like ""full of character"", because I knew that meant dump and ""TLC needed"", because I knew that meant dump. The one I honed in on boasted country living, quiet, serene, pond, lots o' land and everything included! I love where I live. I can't say it enough. If I didn't think raccoons would eat me at this hour, I'd jump on top of the roof and scream to the surrounding hills ""I love you and all your coniferous smells and the creatures you shelter!"" (Yeah, apparently the rooftop would make me a tad wordy.) My landlords are awesome people. Salt of the earth. Nice, down-home, trusting folk. And, as the contract for country people reads, ""Coon Hounds Must Be Owned and Bred"". I had never seen a breed of this type until I moved here. The momma dog was so sweet and gentle and quiet. She was quite the fatty too! Then suddenly she wasn't. And in her pen were ten little squeaky pups, eyes shut tight, blindly falling into food and water dishes, only to be rescued by momma. Cute, no? Who doesn't love puppies?? (If you bring Jackson up, I'll have to cut you.) It's been about month. Puppies have found their voices. All ten of them. And even the momma is begging for a release. Tigger is in the window, constantly doing a head count to make sure everyone is in their place and not a single one wanders off into oblivion. He's exhausted. Momma is exhausted because at night she performs a constant howl that cracks my heart. She's begging to be released from those needy fucking kids for at least ONE night of respite. And I'm exhausted. Because momma won't shut up and deal with her fate and every time a puppy so much as peeps, gaymancat is all over my head doing a get-up-because-they-might-run-into-traffic-and-get-hit-by-one-of-the-four-cars-that-pass-by-here-at-night dance. So I get up. I get a drink. And the howling stops. And Tigger falls asleep in my space on the bed. Yeah...a great apartment, a story book front/back yard, nice landlords, cute puppies and SLEEPLESS NIGHTS. All included!"
dsf,"i am mad and sad, i suffer from depression i have a problem with my family, at first i thought i had a problem but more and more i see that it's not me the only problem is everybody else say it's me ......  i have three sisters who are all older than me they try to control every aspect of my life. i am 27 years old last june i lost my job and had to move with one of my sisters at first things were fine and then she started to degrade me in front of her friends i tried to ignore her for about 3 months she was verbally abusive to both me and my children i did everything i could to keep the house clean and please her but she always found a reason to dog me out one day we had an argument and i stood up for myself and she was on the phone with a friend while doing so,  later on that day her friend called me and invited me and my children to stay with her at first i was scared because i didn't know her well and i didn't know what my sister had already told her about me but i didn't want to take my kids to the shelter they had already experience so much.  so i moved with the friend who is very caring and understanding and my depression was ok for a while.  i was waiting on a low income apartment and they finally called but meanwhile my mom told me my sisters were upset because none of us has ever depended on anyone outside of the family and i am stupid and betrayed the family. but every time i need my family they are never there and if they are they give you lectures and tell everyone your business so i feel alone confused and when i move i don't want to be bothered but i don't have any friends and i don't want to isolate myself because it is unhealthy am i wrong to not want to be bothered or is this a classic case of me being selfish and not wanting to hear the truth from my family below i will give a brief history someone please help!

been on my own since age 17, never been without work, love my children with all my heart, was in a great relationship but family didn't like him so , you know what happened! and never got into any family politics always accepted all for who they were, and finally when diagnosed with depression at age 19 everyone i know told me i am depressed because i want to be and i could change if i chose to .  what should i do?"
dsf,"My doctor diagnosed me with depression (mild form) possibly situational. I have been off work for the past month as a result of a culmination of stressful events over the past year or so. Such as my husband's alcoholism, having a child (she is 18 months now) and returning to work. My doctor put me on Effexor 37.5 mg which has since increased to 75 mg. As a result I have had insomnia for past three weeks, I will try to take it before bedtime now as I was taking it in the morning, but I can sleep during the day but not at night??? My Supervisor did not want me returning to work while experiencing side effects ... the insomnia, nausea, dizziness, etc. I applied for short term disability and received a letter today stating I am not eligible for benefits based on diagnosis of depression and being put on medication!!!! Talk about depressing!!! oh, wait, I already was I have very low motivation, I don't feel like socializing or talking to anyone and some days I don't even want to go out of the house. I have to get up everyday though as I have to care for my daughter while husband works, even when I was working it was still me caring for our daughter and doing everything else around the house ... yes, I am resentful too. I have no thoughts of self harm or suicide, just very negative and unhappy all the time. I have found that the Effexor has made me more relaxed , less anxious and less irritable. But the insomnia is horrible, I was having interrupted sleep before being put on medication and really wanted something that would help me sleep ... rrhmmm. Is anyone else on Effexor and find it beneficial for them. Just wanted to introduce myself and hear from others."
dsf,"Well, I came here for an opinion. I know I should ask a professional, but I just want to know what you think before I even try. It's also a bit hard to explain. I've taken a fair few depression tests on the net from last year and just today with another one. Not exactly totally reliable, but each and everyone said that I showed symptoms of mild to moderate depression. So that's got to point to something.. Also checked out symptoms and compared them. I told my Dad last year that I think I might have it, he brushed it off and just said that it's probably me going through a stage. (I'm 15) So since then I just dealt with things and forgot all about it. Why I think I've got it is, well... where do I begin. Um, I'll just tell you about today. That's if you don't mind reading it. (It's kind of long) Term 2 of my school start today and I woke up depressed right out of the blue. I was worried about other people starting crap with me, the same old people. I like never fight back. Even though I kind of tower over people. I've been told That I should be able to defend myself, me being the size I am It's like I don't have the ability to make a comeback. And I thought about nothing changing, like I was doomed to live the way I do till after high school. And then...well, I started crying. Well, I Caught the usual bus, and felt like people were all watching me. I kept on moving about restlessly (Moving about, looking at different things, never looking at the same thing for more then 5-10 seconds.)Because I thought they would think I was staring at them and that I would look weird. Stalker like. I've been told before in like a joking manner about some of my looks when I'm staring into space. Since I'm bored s***less on the bus, and I'm not really the chatty type, so I just stand there and think and not talk to anyone. It's got me all paranoid about what others will think about me. But yeah, I'm always heavily involved with thinking. Been told in class that 'I'm always in my own little world.' *Rolls eyes* Well, got off the bus, and still felt really s***. Wondering why some of my 'friends' weren't on the bus. Gave me ideas that they didn't like me. More on that later. And when I got to school things were fine. Phew. Except at lunch when I was playing 8 square. I got a little depressed when I got out thinking that I've been playing for so long and that I'm so s*** at it. Been told from some s***heads (None of them play anymore except this one guy.) that I suck at it, so that's really affected me in the long run. But yeah. Now, I have this elective, outdoor education, I hate the class because I don't like anyone in it or know anyone. I know a few and they probably wouldn't mind me sitting next to them, since they've moved next to me. But I always move to an isolated spot because I always think that people don't like me, and if I sat next to them they'd be pissed off with me. But during the whole time in my head I'm thinking that a lot of them are immature, when I don't even know half of them. There was this one guy who kept on joking around with me, (As in I was the joke.) since we had no work and he let everyone talk, except I had no one to talk to. And so I just sat there looking like I was some loner/weirdo person. And he turned around and kept staring at me jokingly all the time to get laughs from his mate, all I could say to him was 'what are you staring at?' but yeah. Everything was alright from then, and school ended, waited at the bus stop for a 'pal' of mine. Who I saw walked with some year 11's right past me wanting a cig from them. Way to go to ditch me, d*** it. And your health and all as well. So I started thinking that he probably just pretends to be my friend because he has nothing better to do at the bus stop. That he'd ditch me at the drop of a hat if someone else replaced me. And well, I started thinking about my other friends. They rarely ever ring me, or ask me over. And during the day I heard about them going and seeing each other and crap in the holidays. And I was, and still am, thinking that they really don't like me and that they're just using me as a tagalong. At lunch it's true since I'm nobody special. And I don't really have any close friends anymore. I got home. Took depression test, said I should ring a doctor right away and that I had 'mild to moderate depression'. Had a bath, and despite the fact that I had two energy drinks, I laid their like I was emotionless. Just thinking about the fact that it could true that I have depression. Since my Mum is schizo-affective. And it explained a hell of a lot of things in my life. Like why last year I hated going to school and the people who were in my class. I pulled tons of sick days to get out of school, and isolated myself in my room. Met people on forums and chat rooms, and found actual nice people who understood me. Which wasn't healthy since I didn't go to school much because of it or really got out. Anyhow, it also explains why I was always tired when I woke up, (It felt like I had never slept) why homework was so hard to do, and why I always lacked concentrating in class and failed math big time. Also explained my temper, why I felt at times why things around me felt gloomy for no reason, why I'm so vain, why I care so much about what other people think of me, why I'm slow to react, why I'm a perfectionist with my writing (I just get ideas that people will care, so I make it tip-top. Try to anyway), why I'm never happy, why I get tired easily, and ECT!!!! I could go on forever. Sorry if I bored you with all that. I probably sound like I'm not an interesting person from all of that. Thanks for your time. And the perfectionist thing is true, it took me a while to write all of this because of it."
dsf,"I've had United Healthcare as my health insurer for 7 years. For the past 6 years they have dutifully paid 80% of my weekly visits to my psychiatrist without any problem. Then, quite suddenly last August, they stopped paying my doctor anything for my visits. The insurer say that I'm only entitled to 30 mental health visits per year according to the contract, but my doctor insists that the insurer is required to forewarn her and me the patient when benefits are about to expire. Neither of us received any notice that my benefits were about to expire. My doctor and I have written letters and called the insurer asking them appeal my case, but they refuse to allow me any more benefits for visits. So I'm going to have to pay my doctor about $4,000 out of pocket. 

Is there anything else I can do to fight my insurance company? My doctor and I both feel blindsided by the insurer and are furious."
dsf,"I have now had BAD night sweats on and off for about 4 years. I am only 32, so it's not menopause and at this point I am pretty sure they are from my antidepressants. I have now tried about 4 - 5 different antidepressants to try to get rid of them but nothing has worked. About 4 years ago I got night sweats when I tried Zoloft which is known for causing them, so I switched to Prozac which never caused them and I was fine, for awhile. Then one day I just started getting night sweats and over the years I tried to get rid of them by switching to Wellbutrin, Effexor, Serzone (I think) and Cymbalta to no avail. My night sweats get worse depending on the season and humidity. At their worst, which as been for the past 2 weeks since the weather change, I am soaked all night, clothing, sheets, pillows, blankets - everything. Then I freeze when I get up to change my clothes or go to the bathroom because I am soaking wet.

I am basically at the end of my rope. I no longer know what to do and my doctor's just choked it up to my antidepressants so they say there is nothing I can do.

Has anybody gone through this and found a solution? Help please."
dsf,"I guess I am writing because I don't know how to think or feel at this period. I feel that I have hurt a lot of people by having my depression, especially my parents. I haven't phoned them in 2 weeks, I just don't have the courage to talk to them. I guess they feel that I blame them for my condition. Same with my remaining 2 sisters. Dang what a situation I have put myself in!

I still have a group of friends that like me a lot, but I haven't told them about suffering from depression. I hide it inside and either act in anxious way or I do solitary activities such as write poems, play the piano or swim.

I guess the main embuggerance is that I finding the third year of my course a real struggle at the best of times, but having understanding tutors and talking to doctors that have depression help.

I don't know why things have turned out the way things are, why I struggle with anything remotely challenging, but I guess that will never be explained. Sometimes i feel frustrated with the way things have turned and I can do very little to change the current of of my present situation.

I feel kind of sick with stuff at the moment. Not that I am assuming a victim complex, but just
that in all the poems I write about, I always seek a sanctuary from the business aspect of life, you know the dog eat dog, go compete with others to get a job and survive for the next 55 years of my projected lifespan. Yeah pretty heady thoughts I'm having!

I guess I'm just scared of the future. I don't know how to survive, I kind of want to blank the future out. I guess all in all, I want to live a simple life and be decent to others. I would like the people I meet in the future to say hey that Haymond guy was a splendid fellow who really loved people and would go out of his way to help them, because he could.


But than an inner anxiety knows that I have hurt people from withdrawing into myself and by depression's virtue being too self indulgent. That hurts the most, knowing I hurt people from my depression. I never intended to harm anyone or be this way. If I could smile and be happy I would, but I can only show the scars of my mental pain as a testament to self torment.

Don't get me wrong, I smile sometimes and even rejoice in the company of those friends in normal health, but I guess I feel rejected. Self rejection and by that of the stigma of the people of the same age I encounter on campus and at home.

I want this to stop I guess. I want a placebo
pill that will transport me to the Elysium fields, because sometimes reality is a bugger to experience. I guess the main message is that I want respite from this life, some form of relief and rest, where I will achieve or obtain this elusive elixir of peace. But I'm here, still standing, still finding a lot of life a challenge, still merging into a crowd of people who are too proud to admit that sometimes things may be too much.

Who am I and what am I doing here ... I haven't a faintest clue. Yeah, I'm scared of defeat, of a battered ego that even a shred of self esteem that I had will be allowed to fly in the fresh wind.

Its sounds like I'm asking for love ... I guess I am. Also that I would love some help, and in no small measure I have requested that help from doctors and therapists and talked to you my dear friends. But I find it extremely hard to help myself, to make amends with the very mind that hurts me so.

I don't know what to think is what I wrote at the top of the blog, now seems apt to include it in the conclusion. I guess spilling my emotions has made me feel somewhat dizzy!

I guess I will wander, spinning round in circles until I get what the whole dang thing of life is all about."
dsf,"Hi everyone I'm pleased to have found this place, maybe I will find some people here who understand what it is like to be struggling with depression. I am currently locked in my own personal hell caused by years of problems that I would never wish on anyone. I have tried to cope on my own for about 15 years (I'm 28), everything has started to go well in my own life and now is the time that it has found a way out (or that's what my psychiatrist has told me). I was married on my birthday in 2005 (I keep calling it this year because I keep forgetting that were now in 2006) and my husband tries to understand but how can he really? I'm off work at the moment because it's too much for me to cope with. I've recently been forced into getting help and I'm waiting for counseling at the moment (there's a 10 week waiting list). I've also been on 10mg cipralex for the last 18 months. I think that's enough to be going on with for now, and its got to be the most somber intro I've ever written! I do look forward to chatting to you all Deb x"

These people are social misfits (not like I'm not!!!) but I can sit in my hamster cage all day and one will talk to me. They really don't talk to each other unless it's either work - related or they are talking about themselves. It's like working with robots, and they are good at it!

I am really thinking I hate geeks but I am one as well but who knows where that takes me.

Can anyone tell me how this is a healthy atmosphere for any of us? Is it common? If I leave and get another geek job, will it likely be the same?"

dsf,"I joined yesterday and have been reading through some of the posts. Thought I had better introduce my self.

I live in the UK.

Looking back on my life I think I have always had depression. It got worse though, 3.5 years ago after the birth of my son. I though i had PND at the time. I was always crying, felt really low and would panic if I was left alone with the baby. It put a huge strain on my marriage and lots of arguments because my husband though I had gone off him. I went back to work put couldn't cope, lack of motivation etc. but like someone said below I put on a 'happy face' to make people think that I was OK. I muddled through for a year then went to see a GP who put me on Prozac. Stupid me came off it after 2 months thinking I was OK. Slowly the depression came back, I wasn't coping with my job, the simplest tasks at work and at home were impossible to face, I couldn't concentrate or make decisions. Last Spring it all got too much. I was getting up crying every morning, I became agoraphobic. I phoned in work and said i couldn't go in. I saw the GP and went on Prozac. I took 2 months off work. I stayed on Prozac until last September. And then, guess what, it all came back with a vengeance a few months ago. This time I was also feeling suicidal which really scared me. So I am now back on the Prozac and determined to stay on it.

I think I have generalized depression made worse by circumstances. The birth of my son, trying to keep a job down and be a Mom, and my husband. Last year my husband really turned to alcohol and ended up ill in hospital. He has been on incapacity benefit ever since, so our relationship and our finances have really suffered. He has changed to. Even though he says he loves me he gets angry a lot, shouts at me, criticizes me, puts me down. I don't know how much more of it I can take, without leaving him. I make excuses for him, that it is his illness and lack of earning power that make him like that but it is no excuse to turn me into a nervous wreck who is scared to say anything in case he shoots me down. The Prozac has reduced but not removed my depression and I still have the odd day where I want to run away. I keep thinking 'will it go away if I leave my husband?' I no longer love him but life has dealt a difficult blow to us both recently and maybe one day when the stresses have been removed I will love him again.

Anyway that's my story (sounds similar to Vanyas who i have PM'd)."
dsf,"I feel like a bit of a jerk posting here when I haven't been around to support any of you, so I hope someone out there is feeling generous tonight.

My background story consists on being depressed on and off for the past 12 years or so, I am now 20. Finally started antidepressants in October. By December the side effects were not stopping and I stopped taking them because I always felt sick to my stomach .... and a person can't work that way. So I stopped them .... I have not been to the doctor since and have been feeling on top of the world.

Even my co-workers have noticed a big difference and my manager has been giving me a lot of opportunity at work (training new hires, being on committees etc)

But ....

then today hit,. like a ton of bricks to the head.

I'm tired, cranky, I cant stop crying and am trying very hard not to cut myself. I hate everything and am just beside myself.  I don't know what to do. I have the energy from when i felt great but I feel like crud and have no where to constructively place this energy.

I don't think I can go back to my doctor ..... she'll just tell me to take the drugs and stop whining.

I'm not so sure I'm depressed. Maybe I'm normal and it's the rest of the world messed up? That's a whole other story though.

Can anyone here honestly say that medications work and you can be a functional person? I mean ... will this ever end so I can get some peace?

Any opinions or insight would be appreciated."
dsf,"Hi everyone, I am new to this site and my name is Elie. I am a 38-year-old married mother of three girls and one angel baby boy who was born still 10/30/2003. My children's ages are 18 years old, 15 years old then it would have been Conner Charles. When we lost Conner due to an underlying infection and when I had the amniocentesis the infection got to Conner and he died a month later. That was very devastating to us but I have had a lot of support with an infant grief group in our area. After we lost Conner three months later we got pregnant with Charlene and she is so beautiful. Anyway things were going good (oh I forgot to mention the fact I remarried my ex husband. We were divorced for 14 years and we got back together). One day when the baby was 11 months old my husband accidentally spilled hot coffee onto Charlene's leg and she had a blanket sleeper on so she wasn't that bad. It was bad enough but because of the way the burn looked (due to the absorption of the stupid hot coffee) the doctor had her removed from our care until they could further decide if the baby was abused. I was dumbfounded; I have known this doctor for 17 hears with my girls Marissa and Jessica, so how dare he. I was so upset, but we have a DSS worker in our lives because of my middle daughter who has mental retardation, she is in a residential home because of her behaviors which in a way was excellent for us. Our worker seen and knew Charlene before the foster care and then when she finally saw her at foster care she did everything in her power to get the baby back and we did six days later. We are constantly in and out of court now because of this and then my husband was feeding the baby oatmeal and I was warning him to be careful she flails her arms, well she flailed and knocked the spoon out of his hand and the clump of oatmeal landed on her face ... we cleaned her up not noting anything bad as she didn't cry or nothing she wanted to eat. She ended up with a blister on her cheek in the spot that the oatmeal touched. We almost lost Charlene again. I went into DSS and said my husband was no longer going to be in charge of the baby and they felt better and I also said he wants parenting classes and they liked that idea. But this is my problem, how do I get passed this. I have a counselor already but you can never have too much support so I came to this web site. I can't even make love with my husband anymore. I resent him for putting me through this when I have been the most careful mother around. We also live with his mother because financially things are tight and right now its better we do because DSS notes it is a very supportive environment and I have a lot of help which I do but I can't leave otherwise I will have DSS up my back quite often. My husband feels that sex is the cure all to depression, he keeps hounding me and hounding me and I just don't want sex. When we first got back together this second time around things were awesome and we had so much fun but then we lost Conner, then had Charlene and then these burns and losing her and going to court. I have no say whatsoever even in my own room which depresses me but soon I will try and figure out how to get out of this. All I know is my husband better respect my wishes, I just can't make love at the moment. The last time was four weeks ago. Ok that's about it for now, that's about the main stuff I am dealing with for now. Take care"
dsf,"I'm new to these boards and I hope I'm posting in the right spot...I have been diagnosed with major recurring depression since 1992. I have a host of chronic, painful auto-immune related diseases. I am also trying to care for an ill family member who just got out of the hospital and had major surgery (takes a year to recover from this surgery). This family member is pretty much bedridden and needs to be bathed, fed, and cared for much the way a private duty nurse would. It is a daunting task for me under the circumstances. Insurance will not pay for long term care and we cannot afford even the cheapest of help. Hence, I am managing all of it alone. Once in a blue moon, my in-laws will help but are very resentful on the rare occasion that I ask for help. My house is cluttered (I saw that topic) and I'm not sure if its because I'm so depressed or because I have been sick too much to take care of it. I think perhaps its both. I know that at least some of my depression is situational, but I also know that some of it is not. I am on medication, but the medicines have never done a whole lot for me. I've tried them all. I was found to be ""resistant"" to medication. Whatever that means. I was hospitalized for a 3 month period in the 1990's for suicide attempts. I guess what brought me here is that I feel like I'm about to ""crack"" and am trying to find a way to avoid that. I am hoping to get past this pain caused by this disease I have so that I can get the energy back that I need to unclutter my house, have a genuine smile on my face when handling my nursing duties and get a hold on my life in general."
dsf,"I'm 19 and I'm severely depressed.  I am at my wits end and i don't know what to do any more.  I feel empty inside and the only way I feel something is when I cut myself.  I don't care what feeling comes out, whether it's pain, adrenaline, or guilt ...  I don't care what feeling, but I need to feel something.  I keep thinking that death will be a sweet surrender and I use to be scared to do it but now I'm not so sure anymore ...  I keep thinking how blissful it would be to finally set myself free, to let my pain and suffering disintegrate along with my soul.  Every time I think of this, I smile ... and it scares me.  I smile at the thought of death. 

I don't how to stop and I feel as if there is no end to this misery.  I stopped talking to therapists, psychologists, counselors, etc.  There is no hope."
dsf,"First of all, a happy Christmas to one and all. My situation is that I have had moderate depression on and off since 18 years old, and 2 years ago aged 33 I had it so bad I had to be off work for 3 months. Then I tried the SSRI Escitalopram and it worked perfectly and I went back to work. I came off it a year ago and then 4 months ago I suffered a relapse and had to go back on it, and now I am OK (except when it came back for 3 days after a booze bender). My psychiatrist is saying I should take them indefinitely. As I have no side effects I am happy with this, but I am concerned about some reports saying that they start to work less well after some years. Is this right. And if so wouldn't it be better to ration them so I only take them after I relapse? So they keep on working for longer, if not the rest of my life. Is there anyone on the boards here who has been taking antidepressants for many years who has found they have become less effective and now regrets having taken them for that reason. And now suffers depression that now cannot be treated by medication? Yes I've heard that you can switch to others, but surely the same type of reasoning applies? The psychiatrist said that I had endogenous depression with a reactive cause, and that she didn't think that counseling would help. Does this make sense? A former work colleague of mine recently said that the antidepressants had made me start acting ""weird"". Well apart from posting on an internet forum I don't think I've done anything weird, and other friends agree with me. But other friends all think that it is not good for you to keep taking these ""happy pills"" for a long term, that antidepressants are a short term fix only.
But what do they know. You can't really tell if others have depression from the outside. Neil (35 years young, from the UK)"
dsf,"Well, a little update then. For those who don't know me that well yet, (which is everybody I suppose) I'm the 20 (almost 21) year old that chose to take a break from school, due to pff what'll it be? Anxiety, depression, health problems regarding sleep/energy. I tried it again at some point, but after 2 weeks found myself to be, not cured yet. I figured it had to end, so I went looking for help. Social worker, well that's all nice and stuff, but not too helpful. Then the official psychiatrists. Well let's pick up from there; the first one, in the Adolescents department directed me to another shrink after the first intake meeting, my help question; not sure. But something was keeping me from being able to fit in the system. I also had concentration problems but she didn't want to dig into that. So this new shrink, on a different department, made me fill in some forms and we had some talks (2) and well, apparently the concentration problem IS a big issue and causing a lot of damage as well as my past (divorced parents, being bullied all my life etc etc.) Okay fine, so I says; maybe I need something to help me sleep? And she suggested I go see my house doctor and ask for sleeping medicines. Which I got, and used for two weeks now and ...nothing. Well, the first 2 days were good, the 2 after that were less good, and I don't even remember the ones after that. I woke up automatically, and sometimes sleep was okay. But after 2 weeks I'm still SO tired everyday, it's killing me. I try and keep up a new rhythm, but it's so exhausting and I feel like doing all sorts of happy things but I just don't have the energy and then I go do it anyway and I end up so hurt and tired. Now, I can't take the medicines for more than two weeks, so today was going to be my last. Well, I sort of should have read the booklet I got with it before use. It said I shouldn't take them EVERY day but every other day, and like I don't know, it says it builds up and stays in your body. Well, I'm fine don't worry. They warned about some side effects, but I seem to have been okay. However, the side effects include ALL the things I already suffered from BEFORE even taking the darn medicines!!! So it's been a complete and utter waste. This one day, I tried sleeping without medicines, and I just couldn't...just, can't fall asleep. So yeah, I had that talk with yet another shrink today, and now he wants me to see some other person. And he thinks I SHOULDN'T take sleeping medicines. So like, ARGH, people keep telling me opposite things, and now they want me to see this person, who'll help me fill in my days and get organized??? That's all cool and well and all, but I got there myself already. I figured it all out before I even started seeing these ""professionals"" and now they're telling me what I already came up with on my own??? It's another 3 week wait. And I don't know anymore. I'm confused about all this, and beginning to think it's been a huge mistake in the first place. And now that it's Spring again, I'm feeling sort of happy. So depression is still here, but, I don't notice it much...or do I? I'm still feeling so alone and my family still doesn't get me...I just want out, I just want to be away from here, which brings us back to the original problem. I'm so annoyed, and after this, today is just going to be another day that I just don't do anything useful... Sure I want to go back to school, but it takes time...I have some time, then again I don't... I had so many plans, and ARGH this sleeping problem, which is going to be my main focus now, is just so darn annoying. I could listen to countless pieces of advice, but in the end, it's just no good to me... Even the stupid sleeping medicines don't work...And every time I go see a shrink about one problem, they point me to someone else, and then another problem bothers me and they send me back but that still didn't fix my first problem. I'm like, fine I'll go fix this darn problem myself then. (I really feel like cursing, but I won't because it's not proper so I'll release some rage when I'm done here, but just know that I'm really upset and annoyed). After all, it was me who had to fix everything all my life right? So I might as well start now... haha such a laugh, I'll procrastinate till the day I die... So very tired. I can't do a thing... ugh, I'm so sick of it. I want to go sleep now, but I just know I'll wake up late in the evening and won't be able to sleep tonight. Such a drag... too young to be broken already..."
dsf,"Well, I'm a sixteen year old girl, and my name is to be unknown, so just call me Kat. I think I have depression, and others have told me that I may, because I have mood swings, I constantly think of death / suicide, and I do cut myself, a lot. When I'm sad I will cry and I will throw up sometimes on purpose. I have issues with the way I look, because I am overweight, and I am insecure about my weight. I have moments where I break down at school in the girls' bathroom and I do carry a razor blade around with me and I will cut myself at school. I have scars everywhere on my arms and some on my legs, and the scars do overlap each other. I have a friend who I like to talk to, and sometimes it helps. I have tried to talk to other friends, but they don't care. So yeah, my parents know I cut, and they're also thinking about getting a divorce and taking me away from the school I love.. I don't know if anyone here cares. Or if anyone here thinks I'm just another fake teen crying for attention .. but I don't care, this is what's with me, and it does hurt.."
dsf,"The last few weeks I have slid back almost as far as before I started treatment. Just when I thought I was improving.

I finally went to the drop in center called Sunshine Place, as someone was giving a talk on depression. The counselor spoke with me for about half an hour after her talk and said she thought I needed more help than my GP was giving. For the first time in a few months I actually broke down and cried again - which is very annoying to me. She wrote down the number of the Mental Health Center with some suggestions for them. I rang the next day for an appointment (and that was hard just to ring). She had told me I might have to wait a few weeks for them to see me, but they made an appointment for the next day.

The psychiatirst there was okay (I didn't even cry like I normally do when talking to a new doc) but I told her I was tired of telling the same things to every new person. The short of it is they are changing me from Lexapro to Avanza and organizing for some CBT. I see my regular GP next Tuesday so I am pleased they said they would inform her of the medication change. I was also warned that I would probably feel a bit more depressed while the medication change was taking place; so I duly warned Mom and Matt not to take any notice of any strange behavior. Matt as usual just laughed and said ""yeah, Mom's going to go psycho"". 
Now I just wait for them to contact me about the CBT.

If I don't answer any posts you'll know why, but I will try to just put a little emoticon up every now and then to let you know I am thinking of you all, and that I am still listening."
dsf,"I just turned 18 and a couple of months have gone by and everything is a mess. I feel so paranoid about everything; that I'm going to die. That every feeling ache or pain is something horrible. Sometimes I just feel like I might have a heart attack and die and I'm just so afraid! I can't sleep alone at night anymore. I feel week and helpless and I hate it. I feel selfish that I'm so worried about myself. Everything has just hit me so hard and I don't know why, and although I've seen doctors and she told me ""oh I'm too young to be feeling this way, too young to take medicine"" I just cant shake it. I'll be seeing a psychiatrist soon too, all my loved ones give me constant reassurance, but I just cant push all these horrible things out of my head. I don't want to cry anymore or feel like this I just want to feel like myself again ...

 ... I'm just looking for someone who understands. Has anyone been through this, these feelings? How do you cope?? Argh ... well... I'm sorry but thank you for your time and patience ... I'm new to this forum .. in fact my first forum post ever written, just hope I can find a little advice ..."
dsf,"everyone. well don't really know what to say so I'll just skip to the point. i haven't cut for a while but right now the thought of doing it again is looking really good. the last few days have just been really hard. i went from having a psychiatric assessment done to finding out that my mom had gone through my room and read all my personal poems and stories to then really wanting to talk about all this stuff to my boyfriend but not even being able to even do that. i just got back from seeing a movie with him and i just hate the fact so much that the one thing that i really want to do i can't because I'm a stupid freak that can't do anything right. i don't know but right now this is the last place i want to be. I'm just really tired. There are people that want me to talk and tell them what's wrong but i can't because I'm scared that they will run. that they won't understand and they just wouldn't care. I've already got a friend who is really annoyed at me because i don't try harder. i just really hate myself, i don't know what to do anymore. i just want to scream. i don't know what i need or want anymore. i just really need to cut but don't want to go back to it. i just don't know what to do"
dsf,"As you live life and learn new things you grow more mature. Life is not about growing up and making plans for tomorrow, it's about enjoying every moment as you're living. Happiness is the most important thing and people have forgotten that. The world is full of so many interesting things that all cost money and we believe having a lot of something is the key to happiness. And since money is the thing that buys us the things we want we sort of become obsessed with getting as much of it as we can. In my mom and my situation we've tasted what money can buy us and we don't want to go back to the way things used to be. But the thing is we were both happy then and now we're not. I've learned money cannot buy happiness. My dad and Julie don't have much money and they are happy. There is something we can all say we regret from our lives. I regret regretting. Everyday I've lived has come to this moment and even after all the things that have gone wrong recently, I can pretty much say I'm happy with they way my life has turned out. I'm happy with who I am behind my mask. I am happy with what I know and what I want to know. Lately I've been wanting to die. Actually no, I wanted to want to die. Depression is all about seeing those bad moments and ignoring the good times in your life. When you're depressed the only thing that matters are the bad times. I don't think I was stupid for wanting to want to die. When something goes wrong you tend to act out of spite as soon as it happens because you are so overwhelmed with the moment. Most people do this - it doesn't mean we're stupid it just means we got carried away and we sometimes do things without thinking. Now I'm starting to realize that the break up with Scott was a good thing. We were forcing something that wasn't making either of us happy. Of course I didn't think about either him or me and our happiness I just wanted to keep us together for as long as possible. Besides I have too many other things going on in my life right now that I need to work on and if we were still together I would have ignored these things. I don't want to become one of those people who throw their entire lives in their online journal so I won't go into everything that is going on with me. If you're my friend you know. I'm through acting like someone else in order to please people. This is my life and I'm the one living it. Other people won't be around my whole life but I will so therefore I'm putting myself and my happiness first. No more staying in one place because I'm afraid of change. I want to experience as much as I can because to me that is what life is all about. No more dwelling on the past it can't be changed - move onto today that's were things are happening and decisions need to be made. I don't want to slip off the road by looking the wrong way like I did on my driving test which by the way I failed. But that's ok, there's always next Thursday. OK enough with the things I've already learned and experienced. Onto new things, new places, and new people. I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself and wanting to be someone else. I'm going to be me again and do what makes me happy. I'm going to take advantage of the help I'm getting and I'm going to help myself get better and not depend on others to save me. And I'm also sorry to Scott, one of the reasons why I was so dependent on you was because you helped me and I thought you could save me entirely and make all the bad things go away. I now realize I'm the only one who can do that. I'm sorry I turned you into my therapist. I'm through with the break inside my hole, time to climb out."

dsf,"I am 20 year old female. I have been on numerous antidepressant and anxiety medicine since I was 11 years old. I never had a problem with sexual dysfunction because 1) I had never been in a serious relationship, 2) I had never been sexual with someone. Now that I am in a sexual, serious relationship, I am having problems. I believe this is a result of Lexapro. I have never had a problem orgasming (at least not to this extent) and I have been on Zoloft, Prozac, you name it, etc. (These medicines were changed because they were either making me too drowsy or simply weren't working). During the summer, I was only on Wellbutrin and had no problem orgasming. However, due to overwhelming anxiety during the start of the school year, I started taking Lexparo and continued the Wellbutrin. Ever since I added Lexapro, I have had an EXTREMELY delayed orgasm, or no orgasm at all. It is really frustrating.  My doctor suggested switching medicine, but since Lexapro is working so well for me as far as anxiety goes, I said I'd rather not. I can't lower my dose because I am on the starting dose for both Wellbutrin and Lexapro. He said I could switch to Effexor or another SSRI medicine, but I may have the same sexual dysfunction.

I was just wondering if anyone here has had a successful combination of Wellbutrin plus an anxiety medication that didn't cause such extreme sexual dysfunction."
dsf,"Hi I'm Ricky, I'm 17 years old and I think I've been living with depression for the past 2 years. I've been through a lot of issues in my life that makes my life feel so unbearable and lonely. I haven't been through any therapy so I haven't been diagnosed with depression but I obviously haven't been feeling happy. I'm a senior in high school and I hate going to school every morning, I don't feel like I fit in really. Reasons are because I'm a social outcast and I don't really like being around other people because I may seem to be off tangent. People seem to judge me too quickly and this really pisses me off, or is it that I'm way too paranoid. I zone out a lot and just stare at people without even saying a word to any of them. Like I'm really anxious around them and I feel completely uncomfortable. I started smoking weed when I was a sophomore and ever since then people such as my friends seem to drift away but it didn't really bother me till now. I don't really have that many close friends other than just friends that I smoke with. My parents say I should avoid those friends just so I can get a better perspective in my life but then I don't know how to make new ones. I really want to make new ones because I want to have a better social life but I don't know how to get myself motivated. I want someone to care for like a girl friend, just so that I don't feel so lonely, but then again I don't think I can have a healthy relationship. My parents also say that I should be more open with God but I don't have any faith (if I don't even have any faith in myself, how could I have any with God). I just turn away and just hide and just think that it will all be different the next day but never is. Please I need some help because I don't want to feel even more depressed. Ricky"
dsf,"I've been reading the ""hoarding"" thread in the OCD forum and I'm jealous. They're having fun bonding by sharing stories about their habits, so I thought we could do some of that with plain old depressives. Sometimes when I'm depressed, I realize that I'm crying over something so stupid that I have to step back and laugh at how upset I've gotten over dumb things. I can't remember all of them, but here are some of the ""highlights"" on the list of Silly Things That Made Starry kitten Cry: my boyfriend told me his cat was giving me a ""mean look"" I set out a pack of Marshmallow Peeps to get nice and crispy in the open air and my roommate threw them out. (Oh, there were tears!). The coffeehouse was out of soymilk on a day I really wanted some soy hot chocolate. What's on your list?"
dsf,"this is so stupid, i have gone over and over same old ranting around for years!

 i could cheerfully pack my bags and walk out on my three kids - and ex partner, and all the grief, i know i could, yet i know deep down, i don't REALLY want to leave any of them, & couldn't  because the pain and hurt that deep, i put up with the shit because i love them all, i'd do anything i could for any of them,  and by god they ALL know it!

 - try not to maybe, but all take advantage of it ! i love all of them way too much - it scares me i could be that cold, i can be hard, and nasty, but i CHOOSE not to be like that, because i don't like it. ( although post menstrual week apparently i am hell ! )

i ought to be on meds! i can't bring myself to take them, i try, i know i should, it just might help, i know I'm tense- but honest to god! - being told off, by my son, slagged off, hurt time and time have to constantly break down, ok i suppose in fairness my ex apologizes when it's appropriate to do so, - some times apologies just don't stop it, I'm hell to live with for every one around me, i fall out with people all the time, there's never any peace in the house, people come go & ring at all hours, i want to "" be there "" for everyone, lol - like I'm so helpful, because then next time it's  , when they need something, they know they'll get it- because how can i not help? and I'm christian, albeit a bad one i expect!

also if they make me drowsy, and aid sleep - that's great,- until son comes home drunk ! ( not loads but maybe once / twice a week, maybe not at all - always when you least expect it though!) / teenagers come round and party, (they are very considerate for teeny boppers may i add and respectful of being able to come back  watching films and drinking / music reasonable 12 / 1 latest - but i wait up for my lad who usually does the walking others back safe bit) also my little girl is adhd, and up very early, i average 4 hours a night - this is also part stress. - every morning i wake to kids fighting, shouting, aruguing. despite fact they meant to stay in own rooms. if I'm not up, it will continue until someone gets hurt, so no lies there! lol

my only babysitters are my ex or my son. i have no other close family.  apart from my dad who lives quite a distance away and is quite elderly, not too great with his mobility.

self confidence is non-existent, i can find loads of reasons for being used, none for being LIKED. as a person.  my son is joining the forces, and on the back of the past few months - it's feeling for me and him like prolonged grief. - we've talked, we both know it'll be hard, it's always been us two against the world as he put it, but yet we still lash out at each other, with the lashing out from all angles ( obviously by me mainly, as it appears to be my hang ups causing all  i REALLY don't know what to do. counseling still not started , i stopped relate, as things are  so hot / cold cold  / warm and communication so awkward - i genuinely thought when i was told forget it that was the case - then boyfriend girlfriend on quite, then hell because of me again, now god only knows but even being considerately polite is a struggle, and humor gone - so is pleasure in anything i do.  - my head is very literally all over the place, i can't get one ""clear"" thing to latch to as such, if that makes any sense?

i have had kids since young n 17 / 18 - never learnt to drive / swim never traveled, never held a career. even study for a year was a nightmare ( i did pass despite a divorce though: english gcse & art acess - lol )

just sick of fighting it out every day, trying to get kids to see why food meant to last a week! silly stuff - every day.  have such a headache trying to map out life so everyone can be content and fulfilled, and feel like for all those i love try  to show  affection, that it comes just before the knife or behind to heal the wound."
dsf,"My name is Jessica. I'm 21 years old and my boyfriend and I have just broken up after 2 years. I'm not sure where to begin ... our bickering and fighting started about a year ago and even though it was always small stupid things we were fighting about I guess it all built up in the end ... 

I know it's probably for the best but I love him and hate the thought of losing him ... he means the world to me ... I just feel like things will take so long to get back to normal with me, especially because we are living together ... I'm in college hence living in student apartments ... I don't want him to move out because i don't want to be totally alone here .. I'm going to miss him and his stupid and crazy ways but most of all his company (when we weren't fighting , or when he was over reacting about things!!!!!!!!) I just don't know what to do at the moment.

I'm sure in a few months i'll move on but I'll never get over it.

he said he still loves me and that maybe in a few months or years we might get back together because he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life with anyone else but me, but i just cant deal at the moment. I'm beginning to think from reading other messages that i may be really slightly depressed or anxious or something ....

a lot has happened in my life and he knows it all ... i just didn't know who i can really talk to about such personal issues anymore ..."
dsf,"My formative years were spent in small towns. Until the third grade, I lived in Indiana. From the third grade through my junior year in high school, I lived in a small lakeside community in southwestern Michigan. You could walk or ride your bike to anywhere - down to the lake, out on country roads, wherever. My father was a Lutheran school teacher, principal and church organist. From time to time, he would take a ""call"" to serve in another Lutheran school in a different town. In the summer of 1968, right after my junior year in high school, he decided to take a call to a school in the north side of the city of St. Louis. It was quite a culture shock for a sheltered young woman who had only lived in small, insular towns all her life, to move to a city the size of St. Louis. Quite honestly, when we arrived here I absolutely hated it. I felt as if I'd been thrown to the dark side of the moon. I had to start my senior year in a new high school in a completely foreign environment. Everyone else already had their group or circle of friends going back at least three years. Now you had to have a lot more guts and fortitude and self-esteem than I had at the time to break into already established groups and make new friends. This was the year that would set the stage for the first major depressive episode in my life. This was the year of my first therapist, the first of many to come. The start of a lifetime of self-discovery."
dsf,"Isn't love great? When my daughter was younger she wanted to marriage her daddy of course (doesn't all little girls want to do that). Before she started school, when she was in daycare centre, she had like 5 boys or so she was ""dating"". After that she has not mentioned anything about boys being pretty or so in school, until....she married our rabbit! lmao. Yes you heard me, she had a couple of friends here and they had a wedding ceremony. I guess she got tired of it cause after that she likes somebody new. Like every girl in her age she fell in love with a famous one, a singer. (When i was her age i was in love with a hockey player but that's a different story).This is him: Darin!. Was in Swedish Idol. Psstt, she's over him now. My daughter is so cute i love you :)"
dsf,"I went on 6weeks. FMLA almost two years ago for depression, GAD and Panic Disorder. I felt uncomfortable when I went back, after having had the same position for 25 yrs, but I'm still there, and no one made a big deal about it when I came back. I'm still on medicines for depression and have a ton of anxiety, which the medicines help with. I'm able to function in a fast paced environment where things change every day. I can sleep, which is great as I put off going in for treatment and was beat when I finally got on medicines, had lost weight, and was headed for agoraphobia. Medicines and some therapy work well for me. I can't deny that I had myself under one ton of stress and had no outlets. I found out the hard way that there's more to life than work, work, work. One has to find a way to relax, too."
dsf,"Hi I am trying to get a grip back on my life. My mental health has cost me my marriage. My husband just couldn't handle it anymore. I was hospitalized five times in April and May for suicidal attempt and thoughts. He was there every day for me but felt abandoned by me. As he said through tears ""he couldn't save me"". After the hospitalizations I was really needy. He married a strong and independent woman. In Sept I took myself off my medicines and went into a rage and accused him of cheating on me. That broke his heart and his spirit...he left. Of course, I went into a tailspin. Finally got of the couch last weekend, three months later. I stopped my counseling and medicines. I know I have to get it back together again. I guess looking for support here is a step in the right direction. I am trying to figure out how to go on when you lost the best thing that ever happened to you. Thanks for listening"
dsf,"I've dealt with panic / anxiety / depression / ptsd for some time now.   I was in a 14 year abusive marriage and it has been two years since I left that marriage.  This past August was one year since my divorce was final.  I have two children, both boys, 6 and 10.  My ten year old has ADHD and depression.  I worry constantly for my kids because of what they saw during our marriage. 

There are so many times I get so overwhelmed and just need to be around people who just ""get it.""  When I left, I brought my kids and myself home to my parents.  I have been with them since.  My mother, doesn't ""get it.""  She thinks that just because I left the marriage, I should be okay by now.  Well I guess 14 years may take a little longer than 2 years to fix. 

I used to come here a long time ago.  I'm glad I came back.  I have seen so many familiar faces already and met new ones as well.  I just want a place where I feel I belong.  A place where I can go when I just need someone to be there.  It's been a long road, with many twists and turns ... I guess it's like that poem, the road less traveled.  I guess that means learning the hard way."
dsf,"I was wondering what people's viewpoints are on for being on medication ...

because it seems like getting the right combo of medications seem tricky and if you don't get the right combination, you still remained depressed ... or worse than before? 

I'm curious to know what the myths .. vs non myths about antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, etc?   Do they make you feel worse?  They say that the medications generally make you feel more like yourself than different ...  but it takes some 6 months to get attuned to them?  Is that correct?

I've been trying to fight off my depression for over 10 years - I think it's a factor from childhood abuse.  In recent years, perhaps my nerves have grown thin ... and I'm slowly wearing myself out ...  my friends have recommended more therapy since I see a school counselor once every two weeks.   But it's difficult to really focus on my emotion health when I know that I'll be relocated in two months  .. and I feel that my current emotional stability is just shaky.. 

Is it advisable to start medications without therapy and then when I relocate to wherever I find a job ... then begin therapy there?  (In other words, I've never been on medications before)

Any advice would be helpful."
dsf,"Hi, I'm pretty sure I'm suffering from depression, and probably have been for the last 18 months or so. It's only been lately that I feel like the rug has really been jerked out from under me, though. I think it started in mid-2004 when I became seriously ill. Between June and September 2004, I spent three weeks in the hospital, umpteen visits to the E/R, and finally, major surgery to correct the problem. Physically, I'm fine now. But we had no health insurance (long story), and when the hospital bills started rolling in, we tried our best to pay the bills, but there was just no way. We ended up filing bankruptcy, I lost my home business, and we very nearly lost our home. Ever since then, I've felt like I'm falling down a dark tunnel, even though the bankruptcy is over with. I was drinking part of this time, but have stopped, thinking that may have been causing the problem. But it's actually become worse since I've stopped.  Here's my ""symptoms"": I don't usually have trouble falling asleep, but I can't seem to stay asleep for more than a couple of hours. It's hard to go back to sleep, so I usually just get up. Weight gain because I find myself eating even when I'm not hungry. The ""comfort food"" thing, I guess. I tend to be a ""stress"" eater, and goodness knows I've had a lot of that lately! I used to enjoy camping and reading books (etc.), but I don't care about any of that anymore. I couldn't sit down now and read a book no matter how much I wanted to. I get through 5 or 6 pages, and totally lose interest. That's depressing in itself, because I used to love reading so much. I have no desire to get out and do anything. I literally close myself up in my spare bedroom every waking hour, only coming out to use the bathroom and to fix supper for my husband. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. I'm not happy, but I can't pinpoint exactly what would make me happy. I honestly can't think of anything. I have no energy whatsoever.  I've been dealing with a TON of guilt over the bankruptcy. After all, the bankruptcy wouldn't have happened if I hadn't gotten sick, you know? I feel horrible for dragging my husband's credit down along with mine, but the way things were, I couldn't file bankruptcy by myself. Our credit was PERFECT until I got sick. My husband sold a bunch of his personal belongings to help pay bills, as did I, but it was so unfair for him to have lost his stuff on account of me. He's never once complained, but I still feel terrible. I've also been kicking myself for the loss of my home business. I can't help but feel like if it hadn't failed (I couldn't keep up with it during my illness), that we wouldn't have had to file bankruptcy. I've never been a crier, but I sure feel like it sometimes. I can't seem to do anything ""right"" these days. Irritable!!! Throwing stuff, being unreasonable, getting mad about petty things. The one thing I haven't experienced (thankfully) is suicidal thoughts. A few random ""morbid"" thoughts here and there, but nothing I'd ever act on. Last night I took several online self-tests, and all of them said I had mild to moderate depression. One even said severe. I guess the next step would be to go to the doctor, but I don't have a doctor. My sister is taking Zoloft for panic attacks and a PMS disorder, so I guess I'll ask her who she's seeing. What do they do ... just ask questions similar to the online questionnaires? Or? I've been reading about all the different kids of medicines, and found the information about Wellbutrin to be the most interesting. Obviously the doctor would know what I need better than I would, but I sure don't want to take something that's going to make me gain even more weight or feel like a zombie. At least one good thing, though. We do, thankfully, have insurance now. Another issue is my husband and family. To them, depression is something that people should be able to ""just shake off"". They don't understand that I CAN'T seem to ""shake it off"", otherwise, I gladly would. My husband is supportive in other ways, but he scoffed when my sister started taking Zoloft. To them, if they can't ""see"" the problem, it doesn't exist. I'm sure they don't mean to be ""mean"", but they just don't understand. Sorry for rambling. Any suggestions or thoughts?"
dsf,"I went to Lauren's place last night with Lee and watched Takashi Miike's Audition with them and Loro's boyfriend Thomas. It was great. Especially for a Friday the 13th. I can't wait to see Ichi the Killer with them. Oh, and Visitor Q! I don't think I've ever known anyone who can sit through his movies and enjoy them with me, rather than be grossed out and run away. Hah! Yay! Hurray for sick fuckers! I panicked at work just before 5:00pm on Friday and ended up calling my doctor to schedule an appointment so that I could get back onto my medication. I thought I would be fine without it. After all, it's been about a month now. My eyes water at the mere mentioning of something upsetting and I've been getting frustrated really easily. Whether I like it or not, I'm going to need to stay on it. Hopefully not forever. I just started to become really worried because orientation for Chili's has begun and this coming two weeks are going to be full-on training. I can't afford to lose it since I already gave my notice in at the shop. I went on a shopping spree at work to get a few things I've had my eye on so that I could still get a discount. Is that bad? Meh."
dsf,"I'm from MD and I too am going through a depression / anxiety moment in my life. I am just always feeling unappreciated like no one really cares about me as a person, unless they need something from me, I am currently overweight, I feel ugly, I have absolutely no motivation in life whatsoever to want to do ANYTHING. If I could sleep all the time I would. My Mother, whom is or was my best friend ,never calls me unless she need money, clothes, etc. My Sister, she never calls unless she need a ride somewhere, my kids are the same way, my Husband on the other hand does not make any moves to want to make love together when we go to bed, years ago he would used to then he stopped because I never did, but we moved past that dumb shit or so I thought, now when I try he will, but he never does anymore, I am not going to make that move all the time, it's all just a game and I can't play it anymore. It's childish and I just don't need that on top of everything else I'm dealing with. I have a problem with dealing with people, like trying to have a conversation with someone sometimes is hard for me, I feel nervous and get all tongue tied when I'm talking to people, it don't happen with everyone I deal with, just some. I have friends, but they never call me, I have to call them, and it's like they ALL do this, is it me? Is it something I'm doing wrong? I just don't know anymore. I feel like I want to take something sometimes, I feel like I want to run away sometimes, I don't feel suicidal at all, so I guess there's hope. Well that's pretty much all about me. I hope to maybe make some new friends on here."
dsf,"Why I always let myself fooled... Why I always think there is something more than there really is... I always think I'm good friends with someone and I act accordingly. I try to be that good friend. Then at some point I always realize that it's not a real friendship. The other one didn't think it that seriously. The other one just talked with me because at that time it was fun. It feels crushing. Realizing every single time that the person you took as a good friend, or even possible friend isn't really thinking same about you. Realizing how stupid, silly and naive you have been thinking that you could be a friend for that person. Realizing how they just are amused that you were so deep involved in it."
dsf,"I am 43 years old and I still feel that I'm dealing with my parents' terrible marriage.  I feel like I don't know anyone else who is in this situation.  I have teenage children and have found that I can't just move away because they are so embedded in their school and friends, but sometimes, just once and for all, I want to live away from my folks. Their marriage has always been terribly dysfunctional and now it is much worse as they are older. When I was young, it was awful, but I still felt like there was some love there. Now, I fell like I witness nothing but hatred between them.  I have confronted them many times - but, there is a strong sense of manipulation whenever this happens and I am left feeling that it is somehow my fault that I don't want to be around miserable people - Any suggestions? How can I finally live my own life?  I'm really depressed tonight. I feel like I can't continue living like this. I am a grown women and I'm still living around and letting my parents' miserable marriage effect me."
dsf,"I had skipped work today because this dream was too good to just let the alarm clock interrupt it. I've been able to hold onto my dreams a lot lately. Such as I can wake up and roll over and fall back asleep in the exact spot in the dream I left off....

Now the dream is I'm at some party. The room is very lavish looking. And everyone there I know. Feels like this party was somehow for me. Never has ever happened. Now the part that stands out is that I see my teacher who was my mentor she was everything to me. When I was in high school I not only had this HUGE crush on her but she was the kind of actor I had always wanted to be except I was willing to die for my art. Still am. She's sitting with her two kids. They're probably the most gorgeous kids I've ever seen and she hasn't changed. Her husband is in the distance somewhere. I never see him but I am aware of him. I thank her for all her time and effort she put into me and I ask her how it's going with her life and if she's still teaching. We talk about something else and the dream slowly fades away.

Reality is I haven't heard from this teacher since I graduated. I heard she had a kid and she moved to vermont. I miss her terribly. Somehow this dream seems to have more than just one meaning. And since everyone else has dream threads I'm going for one too."
dsf,"I've been neglecting you my wonderful little blog haven't I? I'm sorry... I didn't mean to. Last night Carmen was a giggle, and so was the Anakali. I'm glad I didn't go into the Blue Rock. Even in my drunken state I realized it was a bad idea. I'm glad Gem did her job (Go gem!) and I did mine by not going to the Blue Rock after, and taking her home with me so Life is good. ish. Yet again, I am surprised by lack of hangover, but I'm not complaining. The day I get a hangover will be the day cows start flying... hopefully... I shall be quiet now. I have hockey to go to. Tech to do. Violin to practice. Awakenings to happen. You get the idea.... Love you!!"
dsf,"I'm trying to go back to school after dropping out of college many years back, and I've got this real supportive boyfriend who wants to help me. Problem is, he's got this need for me to go out there and change the world. He keeps saying I need to be better than everyone in my class, and that I need to be hyper - prepared before I even start class. I don't mind boning up on the class material beforehand, but he wants to help me come up with theses and bring those to my undergrad profs for help, and he wants me to read a whole bunch of texts from my chosen field before the semester starts. He also wants me to study anatomy because, as he says ""anatomy doesn't really change"", so I can be the ""go to"" person with whom all my classmates will want to study. I'm really bright and would like to make something out of myself, but he's got such high hopes and he wants me to do way too much way too soon. I don't even know for certain what I want to be at this point - getting back into the liberal arts program just seems like a good start towards deciding and acting. All this pressure from him is making it hard for me to even take the baby steps I need to take to make anything at all happen. When I try to tell him it's too much pressure, we wind up in a shouting argument (actually, I wind up doing most of the shouting - he just has this way of pressing my buttons.) I've spent my whole life as an inactive perfectionist, and all this from him just makes it hard to break free from that. Meanwhile, he's afraid that I'm going to spend my life playing video games (a reasonable fear at the moment.) He keeps saying lately that I need to move out of childhood, but he wants to parent me. rrbleh..

is there some way to just move around him without having all these arguments, and without letting him pressure me?"
dsf,"I will be on the road in less than 72 hours. The last month has taken a serious toll on me physically, cognitively, emotionally, and spiritually. Things have suddenly gotten so crazy. Nothing looks even remotely familiar to me (Aggers, 2002). I have held My Sweetie with tears in my eyes, hoping her to buoy my hope for the future. I have been overwhelmed by the enormity of change and possibility, fallen to my knees, bowed my head beneath our roof, and prayed in earnest that it will not be the last. I have wrestled with the stranglehold of others' denial, silently observing time crush their last defense as the flurry of last-minute demands, requests, and desires are left unfulfilled. I have ended my beloved employment, said goodbye to supervisors and peers, returned keys, cleaned out my desk, and stood at the door of my empty office with the first true inkling of the magnitude of what has become the most difficult life transition I have yet faced."
dsf,"this is my first post , so bare with me. I have been married a year and just found out some interesting news about my husband. He told me that the man he calls dad is not really his father. He told me that his mother never told him until he was 13 years old, and had to go to court to change his name. I always wondered why, he and his father never got along. His mother won't tell him who his real father is. I feel I need to help him find him, so he can close the door, and get answers to all his questions. My husband does not like to talk about feelings, he was raised in a family where no one talked about feelings and if you had a problem you  kept it to yourself. I was raised totally opposite. In ways this has left him hurt and confused. He feels like he doesn't belong sometimes. He told me sometimes he would like to know who his dad is and other times he could care less. But, it seems like it is always on his mind, when family issues come about. The man that raised him, is an issue all to his own, he is very abusive, physically, and mentally. He is always telling my husband, he is wrong and will never be able to be successful.

He has heard that all his life, but he has never believed it - he is strong and has a good heart - It just hurts me when I see him lash out. He takes all his problems out on me, I now understand why.

 I have not told him, but I found out who his father is. All I have is a name. I want to tell him but don't know if I should. I don't want his mother not to talk to him if he knows - I'm very confused - I'm right in the middle and don't want anyone to get hurt. Looking for advice - or someone that can relate to this."
dsf,"Hey all, I moved away from my home town 17 years ago and have only gone back for short visits and never met up with any of the people I used to hang around with. These girls still live in the town and still after all these years talk of me and not nice either, the reason I know this is because another friend told me. I am not putting them down but the only reason I can think of is because they are angry and jealous of me as I have been on a sort of adventure instead of staying home and being a single mum. I really can't think what I did that was so bad to them that they still put me down and hate me. They even shouted out my name then said is a **** I was with my mum and it was awful. I was excited about moving there but now I am dreading it and I am petrified incase they decide to start making my life bad when it will be a struggle educating my family on my illness. I just don't know what to and I would appreciate any advice please. HiddenLady"
dsf,"Well I'm getting ready to go back to school so I'm trying to get sober for a while and see i can clear my head. So far I've been sober for about days and i must say I'm not feeling any better. Some of the problem is probably zyrtec which I'm taking for my allergies but really i just feel really irritable and confused. i can't really think too well and it's making me want to drink. Drinking slows down my mind somewhat so i can focus on things in my head. Normally its not till the next day after a good night of drinking that i feel good for most of the next day. i am more talkative and can come up with things much easier. There are people who use Prozac and other anti-depressant drugs not because they want it but because it makes them feel even better than they normally do. This is somewhat my issue with alcohol however i don't fell good normally i feel like s**t normally. i guess i should let u in on what is really bothering me. First ill just list the problems i have i find most worrying. Night blindness ""fuzzy vision"" bad sinus pressure moderate fatigue all the time short term memory problems random aches and pains major depression, anxiety, and ocd bad allergies acid reflux. To be honest most scary one is night blindness. Trying to explain is pretty difficult but ill try. It's like being able to see all the cons and rods and your eye flash on and off constantly kind of like a bad channel on a TV screen. I've had it for years now with no one who can really give me straight answer about it. i went to my doctor recently and got up the nerve to tell him but thought he gave me some good info he probably thought i was mad. Anyway one of the first things your body will do when it's over exerted is give u fuzzy vision. Now normally night blindness is caused be a vitamin A deficiency. Maybe there is something wrong with my stomach that is making me feel the way i am and i did have kidney stone when i was 2 which is very rare. i know this is a lot of information but this is what i deal with on a ""daily"" basis. My daily routine is almost exactly the same except on weekends when i do go out and drink with my friends. my will is low and energy just as low so i find myself kind of in and out of this trance that is supposed to be life. Each day i go to work, come home, eat, and up to my room for pretty much the rest of the night. don't get me wrong i do other things during the week sometimes but i feel most comfortable by myself in my room as opposed to human contact which sucks. So if i have to drink to keep from going over the deep end then i will do so until i get some real answers. If anyone has any answers I'm all ears."
dsf,"I willingly admit that I am a sufferer of depression. But in my case, I think the problem was education more than anything. I recognize that I have been depressed pretty much from as far back as I can remember. I'm not sure where I got the misinformation but I spent most of my life believing that it was just me, just life, you know, the thinking that some people were lucky and happy and I just wasn't. I'm 34 now so it is a wonder that I made it to this point, considering the statistics. I think that I tried to destroy myself in other ways like smoking and minor drugs and not taking care of myself. Basically I was waiting for things to either get better or finish falling apart. About a year ago, my new doctor recognized the symptoms in me and offered me help in the form of Zoloft and some counseling which changed my life. The problem then became that I changed jobs and lost my insurance with no hope of COBRA so I actually went of the drug cold turkey (highly not recommended, believe me) and am now back where I started. Have any of you found yourselves in this situation? What do you do?"

I have been struggling with this for years. I am 40 years old and that even depresses me!! I am on xanax for my anxiety, but they don't even help me any more. My doctor has me on 1 mg three times a day. I get the tremors when they ware off!! It is a horrible feeling! I have been on them for Five years and I feel so upset, because I depend on them so much! I wish I could get off them and don't know how. I never thought I would ever be addicted to anything .but I am. I feel like xanax runs my life. I even tremor in the middle of the night. I tried so many Anti-depressants and they make me feel so physically sick. I just really need some advice, and some support! I am crying all the time, and keep having flash backs of bad memories in my life. I have a understanding Mom and Dad, they tries to help me out. At least I am blessed with them. I just want to find happiness again. I have a daughter who is 11 years old and I feel guilty. because, I don't want her to keep seeing me like this!! I try to keep it together around her. She was diagnosed with OCD at 6 years old. It comes and goes with her. I feel like I am the blame for that even! I joined this group a week ago or so and this is my first time posting. I was told to post at the new members' site. I don't know if I am doing this in the right place. I am confused, with all this! I just need to learn more about using the computer!! I would appreciate any help or advice!"
dsf,"I take effexor and I have gained lots of weight. I have become so self conscious of my self. After buying all new clothes and trying to stay in staying I can't feel sexy anymore.  I love my boyfriend and he is great but I don't even feel 100% sexual with him just because I am not as fun as I use to be. 

I also have dreams that I can't tell if they are real or not. I will tell someone something thinking we had had a conversation I guess it was in my sleep. I sweat like crazy yes, it is gross but what to do?

Also I really need some advice on my boyfriend. He is great supportive but he says it's hard for him to and it takes a toll on him. How can he better handle this, not that he does not do a wonderful job now, but just new advice for his sake. He is not sick with anything and I tell you I get mood swings like crazy. I am not the same girl he met and I so want to be but I can't shake this and I am afraid that it will be here forever. I can't deal with it forever it burns me out.

Please Help

oh yes I also find it hard to have friends because they do not understand I want to go out but I don't and plus most of the time I don't have the energy."
dsf,"I'm a guy...well still a teen but a guy, and the sad thing is I feel such like a girl. I'm not into the macho thing, but I cry all the time when I'm not around people, I feel like crap, I have swings where all of a sudden I just get very very angry at people All these things. I've never gone to a doctor out of fear of embarrassment and telling my parents what I feel. I hide it from them and try to hide it from others...but it usually doesn't work. Its been like this for a year now, but as of late it doesn't end, before there was some couple of day breaks in between, but now everyday I am depressed. I am sick of life...I want to end it, but the only thing that is stopping me is what happens if I do. I just can't get pass the action....what happens during it. There is almost a physical feeling surrounding me...I feel it. That is just how I feel. Hope that gives insight. Maybe it’s the man in me to scared to go to a doctor."
dsf,"Ice 'n' snow 'n' sleet...damn! We had to stay an extra night in B-ham because of the icy roads between here and there. I had an obscenely fun time, and it reaffirmed that I am a complete sucker for 4-part harmonies. The Tallassee Gold Edition male show choir was freaking fantastic--they sang ""Carry On, Wayward Son"", ""Gaston"" from Beauty and the Beast, ""One More Day"" from Les Mis (heartx10,000,000), and ""It's Hip to Be Square"" *dies over and over*. Our female show choir swept the awards in the women's division, it was awesome XD A unanimous, high-pitched clamor that is probably still reverberating through the atmosphere in Africa or something... The co-ed show choir got first runner-up in their division, plus best costumes and best choreography. Yet, the choir that beat us won no caption awards...*grumbles something about blind and deaf show choir bureaucrats* Oh, and the Enterprise show choir sang ""Letters From War"". I CRIED LIKE A BABY. I always do when I hear that song. And apparently I'm hysterical at midnight. At least, according to Katherine and Quinn, two saxophonists I was rooming with. Please let school be cancelled tomorrow. Oh please please please."
dsf,"I'm actually feeling a little bit like a fraud at the moment, because I've read so many different topics today and realized that there are people who have suffered far more than I have. I've joined this site, to start to try and get some help for myself and to talk about the things that have caused me to feel like this over the last few years. My doctor has told me that I'm depressed and prescribed tablets, but I refuse to believe this and have not taken them. I know that this is wrong, but I hate the idea of being labeled depressed.
Before I went to university, I was happy, adventurous, nothing could keep me down. I was in a fantastic relationship, but then I moved into halls, in a flat with six others, who I absolutely adored. One of them in particular, who I fell in love with. Little did I know that he had also fallen for me in the same way, but we were both so shy and I was in a relationship, that neither of us did anything about it ...... until we moved into a house together in our second year with 3 others. This is when everything went wrong. We were always close, really close in fact, and I admitted to him that I kept getting urges to kiss him, hold him and never let him go. He felt the same way as I did, but still nothing was done by either of us. Then one evening we were both out, getting drunk with friends, we found ourselves alone when we got back to the house and kissed. I've never felt like I did that night since. I didn't care about anything around me. We were the only 2 people in the world at that moment.
The next morning, we were both a bit bemused and didn't know what to say / do, so pretended like nothing had happened. The end of term came and we had just moved in to another house with the same people, but were all going home for the summer. I was devastated knowing that we wouldn't see each other until september. I began to resent my boyfriend who I was still with and my family were going through problems because of my father.
When september came, I went straight onto my final teaching placement, which meant up at 530 work all day, home, eat ,work and then in bed by 11pm. I was tired all the time and didn't have the energy to go out in the week, but He was always there for me, and yes, we were still pretending like nothing had happened.
After the christmas of my final year, I decided to party like never before. It was great, but there was still the issue of him. By now I had been trying to convince myself that I was still in love with my boyfriend, purely because I didn't have the guts to leave him and be on my own. How pathetic was that.
Anyway, we went out to the union for a major drinking session, danced like a couple, felt like a couple, got back to the house and one thing led to another. We ended up sleeping together in his room, he initiated it. It was amazing. However the next day we were so confused that we didn't speak for 2 days, until I told him how I really felt. That I had been in love with him since my first year, but couldn't do anything about it, that I was going mad inside because I wanted him so much. He returned my feelings. From then on, we were inseparable, but to anyone who saw us together, we were just 2 very very close friends, who lived in each others' pockets. We were having an affair of sorts and living a lie, but we found comfort in each other and couldn't let it go. I know how wrong it was, believe me I do, and I would be devastated if it ever happened to me.
We left university in the june of 2004. It was the worst time of my life. I felt like I was losing part of me, and was never going to get it back.
Before we left and before the lie really started, I had agreed to move in with my boyfriend in leeds for his final year. I didn't want to do this anymore, but was too chicken to say no, so this went ahead and for the last year, july 04 until now, I have been living with my boyfriend. Things have not been good and I have still been seeing Him (from university) as often as I can. The most recent one was a couple of days ago. We have both joked about running away, children, marriage, but neither of us has got the guts to do anything. It is so wrong and has made my life so difficult, putting on a brave face for friends and family, pretending that I'm happy all of the time. I don't think I can do it much longer.
One last thing, while all of this was going on in my life, my dad was causing mayhem at home. I was being pushed and pulled between the 2 people that I thought could get through anything and that were truly in love. How wrong can you be. I was like a piece of meat being fought over by 2 animals. They constantly bitched about each other to me, leaving me with no - one to talk to. I found myself being dragged further and further down in to a pit which I can't get out of.
I'm in love with Him, but will not leave my boyfriend for fear of being alone, I resent my father for what he has done, I resent my mother for being callous, there is no - one that I have told this to over the past 4 years, nobody who I felt that I could really trust. I don't know what to do anymore. I cry at the smallest thing, hate things changing at all, but most of all, I can't see the point of going on anymore. I just want these feelings to end. My one savior has been my work, teaching children. caring for others and helping them make the most of their lives makes me feel like I'm doing something worthwhile. I'm not expecting any replies, I just needed someone / thing to listen."
dsf,"I had my second appointment with my naturopathic doctor today. I'm getting this feeling that she is really just a therapist for people who don't want to go to a therapist. She lets me ramble on about all sorts of things that have very little to do with my health. Like what our rules for Jeffrey and food are. Last time she gave me a series of homeopathic remedies (Undas) to support my liver. This time it was a capsule called Ichol. I'm not sure if these things do anything more than lighten my wallet, but I'm willing to try them for now. I do desperately need to lose weight and if there is any chance that these things will help, I'm willing to go for it for a while. I've been searching the net reading about Katirina and other personal tragedies that bloggers are going through and I'm sort of jealous. My life is just full of 'normal' stuff right now. My grandpa died in August and we went to his funeral but it doesn't affect my life in a large way. Just in the morally rehensible way that now I don't have to feel guilty about not going to see him. It's not that I didn't want to see him, I just never found the time and now I don't have to worry about it. At some level I'm sure that means that I'm headed to eternal damnation. In other news, we've managed to find a geo-cache. It took us three trips to the spot because dusk is not the time to find dark colored boxes hidden in an unlit forest. Even if it is just 2 kilometers southwest of our house on a really nice nature trail."
dsf,"I AM LOOKING FOR ADVISE ON MY MEDICATIONS BEFORE I CALL MY DOCTOR BACK AND SHE THINKS I AM DRUG SEEKING. OK, I HAD BEEN ON WELLBUTRIN FOR 1 1/2 YEARS, I FORGET THE DOSES, BUT I THEN WAS PUT ON EFFXOR DUE TO MY PERSISTANT DEPRESSION. I WAS NOT FEELING ANY EFFECTS FROM THE WELLBURTIN SO WE QUIT TAKING THAT AND MY DOCTOR PUT ME ON ADDERALL!!! BECAUSE MY DEPRESSION WAS A LOT BETTER AND WE THEN WERE GOING TO WORK ON THE ADD. WELL I HAD TAKEN THAT FOR 3 MONTHS AND I HATED EVERY DAY OF IT. I WANTED TO TAKE IT BECAUSE WELL SEVERAL REASONS AND I KNOW NOW THAT I DONT WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT EVER AGAIN!!! WOW !!! BUT NOW WITHOUT THE ADDERALL OR THE WELLBUTRIN I CAN NOT GET MOVING, I AM TIRED EVERYDAY ALL DAY, I SLEEP ALL THE TIME, CAN NOT GET ANYTHING DONE, I HAVE NO MOTIVATION.

I HOPE SOMEONE CAN HELP ME. I WANT TO BE NORMAL AND WELL. I WANT TO HAVE A WONDERFUL SUMMER WITH MY DAUGHTERS BEFORE THEY GROW UP AND ARE ,,,, GROWN!!!"
dsf,"I have never had dreams that I can remember, before I started treatment for depression.  Oh sure, everyone once in a while, I would wake up and know that I was in the middle of a dream when I woke, but I know at times I could go for weeks on end and never feel as if I had dreamt or if I had, I couldn't remember.  I also know or have been told, we all dream every night, it's a fact, we just don't remember them. 

Since I have been taking medication for depression (Effexor and Klonopin), I dream every night!  And not just one, several dreams.  They are very vivid, most of them don't make any sense but some of them do.  It just amazes me how much I dream now and the things I dream about and can remember!

Has anyone experienced this and can it be related to the medications?"
dsf,"Oh yeah!!! I am 52, perimenopausal and on EffexorXR and the occasional chlorazapate. I could NOT figure out why all of a sudden I was feeling so much worse shaky, can't sleep/want to sleep all the time. Then a ping went off in my head and I went ""Duh!"" I had stopped taking the hormones 5 weeks ago and have been in a gradual downward spiral since. It just didn't get bad or noticeable till last weekend. Called my GYN and told her the hormone reduction experiment was a total failure. I'm going for a new hormone today. I have heard that very low dose BC pills can help if the PMDD gets really bad."
dsf,"Well, I have to admit that as a male I've always viewed my own depression as personal weakness. I still do, I can't help it ...it's a notion, feeling or philosophy or whatever that's been instilled from an early age. I know this is not a popular or realistic way to feel about depression. I mean, it's an illness, right. I've never been to a doctor to have my condition properly diagnosed or treated. At the moment, I really can't face my doctor with that sort of issue (btw, I'm in my mid-40s and I've suffered from depression since as long as i can remember) - I've learned to cope, in a fashion, but probably at the expense of a reasonable sense of social 'normality'- i.e. divorced, emotionally empty relationships, enormous amounts of time spent alone, dissatisfied working life, etc. One covers up & disguises the depression at work, at home, and wherever/whenever necessary...and then, when you're all alone, the demons can come out to play(or even before you're alone) - but at least you maintain the expected external masculine dignity, most of the time. For example, today my son wanted to come over to visit me but because I've been feeling so miserable and morbid and soaked in ennui this week, I made an excuse to put off his visit because I didn't want him to see me feeling low & depressed(and weak) and thus ruining his day/week. Instead, I went out on a freezing 10 mile walk alone to try to physically squash the depression. This is a regular occurrence - I get depressed, I hate myself for being weak, so I do something physical to try to alleviate the symptoms(and also to punish myself for feeling depressed)... it works...temporarily. In my mind, this sort of masochism is (or has been)preferable to taking alcohol, drugs (even prescribed medicines), fags, therapy or inflicting real self-harm and so forth because, at least, it keeps me feeling physically fit-physically balanced(and I guess that's important to me) even if it's not always an effective cure for one's depression. And I can keep up the public pretence that all is well. Sorry, back to the point - yes, it seems a lot of men do tend to suffer depression in silence (one wonders what the real percentage could be!).When I joined this group yesterday it was the first time I'd openly voiced the notion that I DO suffer from depression. Not so macho. Perhaps my condition is getting worse... or maybe I'm just feeling a little more realistic about what it is to be a male suffering from depression. Are there MANY women (or even men) out there who are truly sympathetic to males who suffer from depression? Unfortunately, I haven't seen much evidence out there so far?"
dsf,"I can't do this anymore. I can't keep telling myself I'm happy. I can't keep ignoring the pain! The constant pain...it won't go away...always there, a sharp knife in my heart. Day in and day out it hurts, whether I'm happy or not, it hurts. I can't do this anymore. All I want is for the pain to end...just end! I have nothing. Not a friend in the entire world who cares. Do you know what it's like to have no friends? Not one at all who can be there for me. I've got nothing to stand on anymore, nothing to cling to. I've got no reason to live left in me. I don't even have religion anymore. Christian, Buddhist...I'm not either, I'm nothing...I have no faith in afterlife, I just want to die. I can't keep living like this...I can't keep living. I am nothing...I have lost all hope, I have nothing but despair...nothing but constant pain, constant fear, constant hurt. I can't go on like this, even physical pain is better than this. How does one who is so fully dead inside...still be too afraid to die...yet want death to come so badly. Who does not care whether he goes to Heaven or Hell or nowhere at all."
dsf,"One of the biggest things i'm struggling with (besides my depression duh) is finding a good therapist. I moved about 6 months ago, and I have not had luck finding a therapist that I can work well with. I know that I need help with cognitive therapy, and i've gone to a couple therapists who have cognitive listed as a specialty, but when I get into therapy with them, its all talk therapy with little to no help to me. Don't get me wrong, talking does help, but I know from my years of dealing with this illness that I need some good solid cognitive therapy to help me to overcome my lack of self n worth / self n esteem / confidence.

Also, has anyone had any luck with alternative therapies?"
dsf,"I have been so depressed over a lost friendship. I have known this girl for about 5 years. We were very close or so I thought. We both had boys around the same age, went on vacations together with our families, and both went through our 2nd pregnancy together. I knew she was a person that had to have things her way but I accepted this. She has a large circle of friends that she included me in. I felt her family was mine, in a way. I am very shy and came out of my shell. Last year I got caught up with 2 other friends that were having problems. They really needed me. So I wasn't around much but I am always available if she needed me. Anyway, we got into a misunderstanding over something very minor. I really didn't think much about it the next day. That is the way I am. I get mad then I am over it within 24 hours. She is not like that. She holds grudges. I saw her the next day (4th of July) at her house. I knew she didn't really talk to me but she did have a lot of people there. Well,a couple of weeks after I call her saying ""Hey girl, can I pick land on up?"". She said ""How can you call and act like nothing is wrong?"" Then she hangs up on me. I wait until the next day and called again. First thing she says is ""What do you want?"" I say ""Just to be your friend."" She says ""We are no longer friends. There will be no more double dating with our husbands, vacations, you are to not come to my house, We are not friends"". I was blown away. I asked what I did and she couldn't give me a direct answer. She said we had different friends and I had more drama than any of her friends of 20 years. I asked her what drama? Last year I had some problems with my husband but I didn't really talk to her about that. She said  that was a problem, I didn't tell her things and that is what friends do. WHAT? She was contradicting herself. She hung up on me again.

It is very difficult for me because when I make a friend and let them into my heart they are my friend for life. Her son is my son's best friend and her husband is my husbands best friend. I had recently told my husband to not mention their names around me because I become really depressed. My poor son doesn't understand why she doesn't like me anymore. How can I explain when I don't know. I bought her daughter a shirt about a month ago and she didn't acknowledge it until she saw me in Walmart a week later and we were face to face and she thanked me. It was very weird. I haven't seen her since July. I can't let my son have his friend over anymore because it hurts too much to see him and know that I am not welcomed in their home and they haven't asked my son over their house since all of this even though he still came over ours. I can't figure out what I did that was so bad. I wish I knew so that maybe I could at least defend myself and have some closure."
dsf,"I am new here. I'm from Australia, I'm 27 years old next month, married with a 2.5 year - old daughter and a baby son on the way. I work in Insolvency (liquidations etc). I have been on antidepressant medication on and off for about 4 years now (initially Aropax, now Aurorix), in hindsight I have actually suffered from depression for my entire life. I'm a similar personality to my mother who also suffers from depression. My younger brother and sister seem to have drawn the long straw as such, they seem not to be affected.

Things went downhill for me about the time I started on medication. I was in the early stages of a major gambling problem, and untreated depression had led to a real strain on my marriage. We split up for 3 months (during which time I made 2 lame suicide attempts), reunited and seemed to get back on track, having our first child. Throughout this time the gambling problem intensified, and spiraled out of control to the point where I am now a bankrupt. During this time I also became extremely withdrawn to the point where I hate leaving our house and am more or less unable to cope with spending time with anyone except my wife and daughter. I also had something of a breakdown about 9 months ago, quit my job, which led to great tension between me and my wife (spending 24 / 7 together), eventually she could not cope and moved out. Shortly after we worked it out and I moved in with her.

Things seem pretty good now, we are a lot more relaxed about things and we just seem to get along better, looking forward very much to the birth of our second, in about 6 weeks time. My gambling problem is pretty much dealt with (thanks chiefly to having little money and no access to it now) but I am still depressed, withdrawn and generally tired of life. To be honest, I am only around because of my wife and daughter, I feel little reason to exist other than for them.

I am also a christian and this is very hard, because there is a real burden of ""I shouldn't feel this way, I should be happy"". This leads to more depression, and at the moment I am reluctant to go to church, I don't pray or read the bible. I'm generally resentful of anyone who I consider to have a better existence than me (which is just about everyone). So while things are quite stable at home, I personally am at my lowest point in some respects. I am quite intelligent and every employer I have ever had has commented on my abundance of potential but lack of drive. So true, I lack any kind of ambition (and harbor something of an extreme opposition to materialism and the pursuit of money and possessions) and even now am tossing up whether to continue working. I have a chief interest (i.e. motorsport), but other interests have been decimated e.g. I used to be quite a good pianist but now have absolutely no desire to play. I also can't get the motivation up to get involved in playing sport, which in the past has been a big part of my life.

So that's me in a nutshell. My extreme difficulty in taking on face to face help / relationships has driven me to get involved in some online depression forums as I think this may be a good way for me to start some kind of recovery."
dsf,"Here's my story, however dull and blunt it may be ...

High school was great. Lots of fun You know-  Parties, beer, dates, sports and the works. I was never what one would call popular, however, I was respected by nearly everyone I went to school with. This, I feel was an asset of mine and helped me with self confidence as well as developing as a individual.

I'm now 19 (20 in June) and have no job, no money, don't go to school and have LITERALLY no friends, aside from my parents whom I still live with a leach off of (what a joke). I am virtually reclusive in my home with the occasional outing to buy cigarettes and to visit my Grandmother who is well near her deathbed.

I suppose my past bout with drugs may be a co - culprit influencing me to work in 'close to' complete isolation.

Maybe there is a cure for me but, chances are it isn't natural remedy. My addictive personality and past drug experiences has veered me away from trying the latest depression medications or any for that matter.

This condition of mine, whatever the fuck it is, started developing slowly. I would avoid large social gatherings at first, then I would pretty much steer clear of meeting with friends (even the closest of friends), and finally I wouldn't even take phone calls. At this point it's all of the above.

When I do confront a person, which by all means I try to avoid, I can't for the life of me keep eye contact like I used to and I seem like a complete, uninterested asshole who is simply in a rush and has no time for chat.

For instance, a two old friends of mine from high school stopped by at my house today to catch up on things. When asked what I was up to I looked at the ground and replied, ""Well ... I'm [pathetic excuse of a lie goes here] ...."" Nobody buys my shit. If I don't believe myself how can anyone else.?

So, here I am today. The table has turned. I am now the chump. The one without any respect OR self respect and the guy who respects anyone who isn't as lowly as myself. And I hate myself for it. It isn't as if I had a rough upbringing. My parents are and were loving, I've had so many friends, all the opportunities in the world. And I waste it all and continue to do so every stinking day of my life.

I'm not looking for sympathy. It actually matters little if nobody reads this at all. I just needed to put my thoughts somewhere I could come back to re - read and contemplate them"
dsf,"I bet you think this post is about you. What do you know? I'm back! And, if you're reading this, you're back as well. Glad to see you again. Looking' good, kiddo! Yeah, I know. I'm a prick for not posting for so long. But, lately ... okay not lately. Basically, I just recently realized some worthless pathetic 'friend' of mine has been doing nothing but screwing me over since I've known them. Don't you hate that? Yeah, so unfortunately, this has taken up a lot of my energy. That, and I'm poor. And some asshole sideswiped my car in the middle of the night and took out my antenna and side mirror, not to mention fucking up my door and windshield. As you may have already guessed, I've been a ray of fucking sunshine as of late. The hate-o-meter is flashing red and this god damn alarm thing won't stop blaring, and the neighbor's dog won't stop fucking barking. SHUT THAT DOG UP! SHUT THAT DOG UP! But anyway, those are my excuses. Not good excuses, mind you, but it's all I've got. Donations are accepted but not required. I hope the four-twenty holiday went well for all of you good-for-nothing potheads. I myself had a smashing holiday when some of that sweet vegetation unexpectedly came into my life. It was ... alright. Not of spectacular quality. Crap. Eh, did any other holidays pass since I last wrote? Easter, maybe? I believe once again I was drunk on Easter. Mother's Day is coming up pretty damn fast, however. Shit, well mom, I hope you appreciate handmade cards like you did when I was five. Fuck, where's that glue stick? And WHY DON'T WE HAVE ANY GLITTER??? Oh, well. See, this is why we need to be rid of holidays where I either don't get a day off and slash or holidays where I have to buy slash do stuff or suffer the consequence of feeling guilt. Don't I have enough guilt already? Sorry the funny is lacking, kiddies. It's hard to be funny when you want to beat someone's head in with a tire iron covered in bloody feces while Pantera screams in the background. I would've also accepted Slayer. Or Wham. I'll post again when I stop feeling homicidal. okay less homicidal."
dsf,"You don't have to read this, it's just a short story.

A few years ago i was in love with a guy, we were in the same course at school.  I got so nervous every time I saw him. However, he didn't say a word to me. He ignored me. He didn't even look at me. I didn't want to ignore him, i tried to get his attention, but i just didn't manage. It frustrated me. I just didn't understand why he deliberately ignored me. I was so down, I started cutting again, didn't eat for days, ...

It lasted one year. The whole year he never said a word to me. Not even when my sister died.

I don't understand it today and I never will. I never will forget the pain. However, i don't blame him for ignoring me. Everybody has the right to ignore me. But it hurts me so much.

And today I always get the feeling people ignore me. And when people i care about do so, it's horrible. Maybe they don't deliberately ignore me, but i always think they do. For me it's the worst thing you can do to a person. It's worse than hating somebody.

I wrote a poem for this guy, it's not good, but i want to share it.

Don't blame me

Don't blame me for thinking of you, because you just don't know how i feel

You never knew me and you never will, but i know you so well, yes i do.

Don't blame me for dreaming of you, because you just don't know how much it hurts

You are so far away, but you're in my dreams, there i can reach you, yes i can.

Don't blame me for searching for you because you don't know how much i miss you

You never looked at me like i look at you, I need you, i always will

Don't blame me for loving you, because you just don't know how i feel

My close friend died in a car accident last may, I am going through relationship problems, my body isn't fighting disease off very well, I am looking for where i belong in life / school, I was sexually abused by my boss and have a trial coming up the first of march, I have classes like physics and calculus to look forward to, my father and i haven't gotten along very well which is really hard because we were very close, my mother is pushing me very hard especially since i have interests in becoming a doctor, my job barely pays for my gas, my school told me i would be able to attend a seminar in Wisconsin and recently told me somebody else got to go instead, my friends are few and of lately not very true, and sadly that is the start of it ... i was hoping that i would be able to find somebody that could lend an ear since i have trouble finding anybody that cares much here.  i need a friend ..."
dsf,I really don't know what to do. I have no reason to be sad but I am. It seems like more and more I want to cry. I have a boyfriend and a loving mother but I still cry myself to sleep at night. I go to church and I'm not good in school but for the most part I enjoy going. Please help. I don't know what to do. My mom says I have mood swings and I've noticed that I can go from laughing one second to crying the next. I'm 15 and I just really need someone to explain how I'm feeling to me.
dsf,"I have so much to say and don't know where to start......

Let's see I am in a relationship with a man who is not the same guy I met before he was so caring and always wanted to give me affection. Now all he can seem to do is drink and constantly want to fight. He has become to the point where everything I do is monitored he checks my cell phone to see who has called, checks my EMails to see who wrote, calls me 2 - 3 a day to see what I am doing, won't ""allow"" me to go over to my friend's house, who I have known for almost 20 years, without him being there, and checks the history on the computer to see what web sites I visited. Now I have NEVER cheated on him, and I always find wrong in what he is doing. Some days I just wish he would leave, but other days all I  seem to hope is that  he will change. Every one of my friends thinks that he should go since he is getting physical, but he is my security. I don't work and I can stay home with my 7 month old baby he provides for us, and the baby isn't his. If he goes how do I do it ? If he stays will he change? I have tried to talk to him, but all he says is that I am never happy. I need to grow up and stop acting like a kid .... I want to smile again I don't want to be controlled, but I want him?  Someone please HELP !!!!!!!!

I do ask  MOM for a lot of help, but I don't think that is too kid like........

I can be a B word, but only if I am mad about something he won't help me on ........ I want a day to myself, a night to go out with friends, but he won't watch my son. Even though I watch his 3 year old every day 7 days a week so that he can provide for our family ....

Sorry I could go on forever, but I think that you get the point ....... By the way I am a 25 year old in case you are wondering????

Will you help me PLEASE !!!!!"
dsf,"In college (10 years ago) I was the victim of a gang rape. I've read up quite a bit and identified with all the stages and normal reactions... I went through the self blame, and guilt, and anger, and depression, and I came to realize it wasn't my fault. I never reported it and after a year I decided the best thing would be to forget about it. I pretended it didn't happen and went on with my life. I forced it out of my thoughts until it was no longer a struggle to do so. Eventually I almost did forget about it. I never thought about it and when the subject was referenced in other contexts I never even thought about my particular experience. It almost became some movie I saw, or some girl I knew about. I'm married now with a four year old child and I have a really great life. About six months ago I started having these rape fantasies. I've been too embarrassed to ask my husband to act them out, but he does oblige in rough sex, and I started asking for it more often. I've felt confused as to why I would want this with my husband (and it is always with him ... I don't desire this with anyone else) when I have this history. It started me thinking about them even again. Then I started having nightmares about three weeks ago. Horrible realistic dreams where I actually wake up and I'm still hallucinating that men are holding me down. Last night I punched my husband full in the chest because I thought he was attacking me when he was just trying to wake me from a nightmare. This along with the COMPLETE lack of sexual desire where before we had a very healthy sex life. I'm a big fan of the ""STOP THAT"" approach to self help, but I can't seem to stop this. I'm beginning to dwell on it now.
Also I try not to ever deny husband and with the high job related stress he's having right now he's seeking sexual gratification every night. I'm beginning to dread bed time, and after he's asleep I'm up on the computer and drinking!"
dsf,"Hi all, I am in hell of major depression. After being for over 8 years on Elavil and Valium(small dosage), with good results for most of the time, I tapered down because of the side effects and have been drug free for 1 year. During this year the depression slowly settled in making my life unbearable lately. I don't know what to do. I saw 2 psychiatrists within last month. One of them wanted me on Paxil and the second one on Effexor. Problem is I am so afraid of side effects that I can't begin taking any of them, meantime my life is falling to pieces. My nervous system was completely messed up by these medicines. I had severe fasciculation of muscles for over 4 months after being medicine free (sign of tardive dyskinesia, untreatable neurological condition) and get them back whenever I try any supplement that would increase serotonin level (SAMe, St. John's Wort, Rhodiola). My memory got better after I stopped the medication but now it's falling apart because of the depression I get de-realized I mean if depression won't kill me these medicines will. What are my alternatives (if any)? Shall I take these medicines, for the time being, endure side effects and expose myself to degenerative damage? Shall I stay away from medicines and get incapacitated by depression? Is there any alternative treatment for major depression? I would appreciate any advice. Dania"
dsf,"Medicines can and do stop working. I am going though this right now. I suffer from chronic depression. Had it since I was 5 and I am now 42 so I have been suffering for 37 years. God, I never realized how long it was! I sat in therapy for 4 years after my ex attempted to hang himself. I saved his life by taking him down from the noose with the help of my brother. The first words out of his mouth when he was out of his coma and the swelling went down was that it was all my fault. I knew then it was ME who needed the help. So for 4 years I sat in therapy and they never diagnosed me with chronic depression. If they did, they never told me or put me on medicines. When I switched therapists, that was when she said that I needed medicines. They gave me Prozac. That made a HUGE difference after the first 3 weeks. I took that for 6 years. Then I had gastric bypass surgery and when you have that, your body doesn't absorb the same so it stopped working. I took effexor for a while, did nothing, and now on celexa which is doing nothing at all. I am sitting here reading this forum and crying. So basically, medicines CAN stop working. Time to go get an adjustment."
dsf,i have been taking paxil for 3 weeks . i was on cymbalta for 1 month before my paxil. now i have only had one good day so far. i feel like crap it's scary. i even went to have a aids test along with my blood work because i feel so awful. my hands and feet sweat so bad i drench my shirts . this sucks for a girl .i get hot flashes so much i have to sleep with a fan in my face i hate this and am so worried about the way i feel . is this normal?
dsf,"I'm a 30 year old, married, stay at home mom to 4 kids.  I was diagnosed with depression about 2 years ago after some MAJOR problems in my marriage.  Although I've been in and out of depression for the last 14 years.  I was put on Prozac, took that for 2 years and made the mistake of taking myself off it.  So, I'm right back where I started from.  I think for me a lot of it is .... my life should have been so much different.  I shouldn't have gotten married at 19 (even though I love him), should have finished college, etc .... there are so many should haves you know?  I've been suicidal ... though not for a long time.  I know there are things I need to do for my kids and my family, but many days I just can't bring myself to do them.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME???  Even though I know the answer I ask the question every day.  Why can't I be normal?  Why can't I just be a wife and a mother and have that be enough? 

I wish everyone well in this terrifying journey we all have to endure."
dsf,"Alright, I've been here before, to this site and this depressed on life.  I have experience that would get any person out of depression and live a pretty well rounded life.  Only to be honest I sometimes choose i think to be down and out all the time.  I was in recovery from a drug problem for 2 years and i developed a relationship with a Higher Power that really really helped with my depression / anxieties / addictions.  So it would be insane for someone who knows the solution to not use it right?  Well i've heard it said before, that once someone who had great faith loses it it makes it  more difficult for that person to find hope or faith, so that's where i've been the past 2 1/2 months, hopeless. 

   I tried Heroin after 2 years clean.  Looking for something to shut my mind up and find some comfortable peace due to my increasing loneliness and depression.  I only got real sick for about the two weeks i was on it and lost a job and apartment.  Then i moved back with my mom who has deep anger at my dad and life i guess who is with a man that is using her in my opinion, he's in a halfway house and just lays on her couch all day.   And my dad has deep depression / bipolar on every medication you could think of and lives with his mom who only talks about ""the divorce"" and how ""i should have did this different"" So really if i look at it long enough and deep enough they're alive but dead in a healthy emotional, spiritual, mental level, so where's the encouragement or love i so long needed as a younger person, and even most importantly i need some guidance now, instead of being ashamed of who they are.

I just need to vent.  I'm 22 i just started college last week and i am extremely anxious when there, I feel as though i wear a suit, outfit, costume of misery, fear, depression, THE VOID.  So it drives others away, plus i am ashamed of being a depressive / anxious dude so keeping others away is my aim.  I mean i'm 22 i should be getting laid and having fun right?!  Man i feel so old but so immature emotionally.  I talked to a friend of mine that is at Yale in Connecticut last night who has always been a good natured, smart, artistic guy, and a person who experiences depression but doesn't let it get the best of him, and he said to not dwell in the negative like i've always done, find something through out the day that is positive, a girl smiles at you, a song whatever.  MAN, I can't just turn my mind off from negative thoughts of me and others."
dsf,"I just need to rant because I see what my life could be and what it really is and just get so frustrated! I want to be / feel normal! Instead I keep a part time job I hate when I should quit so I can focus on my wedding and school and other things. I'm failing horribly in school and there is no reason why I should! I have a learning disability but I should try harder, and I only do part time studies! Our wedding is coming up and of course planning is stressful but I want to be more organized.

My fiance each have close family members who recently got very ill & are so worried and trying to cope and take care of them. Sure we have a lot on our plate but I see people with the same amount of stuff at the same time!

For example I knew a person in high school who was always on the honor roll, took an extra night class, had a boyfriend, friends and social life, and a job! Then in University the same thing as well as scholarships.

I would crumble under the pressure! I'm so sick and tired of doing a half assed job of managing my life.

I HAVE TO quit that job, stop watching tv when I should study, organize my things rrARRRRGGGGG I'm just so angry. I'm 25 years old and a total mess. I don't know what I did to deserve the angel who will soon be my husband, but I'm so thankful that he keeps me afloat & my head on my shoulders."
dsf,"I have no idea where to start so I am going to begin at the beginning.

I have somehow managed to hit rock bottom again as far as emotions go. 

I should be happy. I am about to graduate from school, ok so I am middle aged and overweight, but hey I am in school ..... again.

I should be happy

I have over 12 years of sobriety, i am a certified health care provider, and I have a teen daughter most people don't think is possible to have

we still like to spend time with each other ... apparently this is a lost art for teens and parents

I am utterly convinced that everyone of my classmates is afraid of me and they all want me gone

I am unable to look myself in the face without wanting to vomit

I feel afraid, hopeless, lost

every time I get close to achieving a goal I have worked hard for I go into this self destruct mode

I do my level best to sabotage myself

like now I should be working on a resume, a cover letter, and a portfolio as well as studying for a very hard test

but here I am on the computer trying to figure out if I am a whiner or in deep trouble

the thing that made me sit down and write was the thought that crossed my mind on the way home. I thought how much better my daughter's life would be without me around

she could go live with my sister and never have to worry about money or a roof over her head or being able to have a good prom night

she could be happy and never have to worry about me again

my roommate would be better off

so would my family

I am not even sure at this moment if I am serious about wanting to be done with it all or if it is my sabotage mode

this is so stupid

I was abused for most of my life. you can think of it it was probably done to me and now there is no one to abuse me but me, I am picking up where they left off

Stupid ... no?

and to top it off my email is about to be cut off because it's pay that or feed the kid

so if anyone wants to reply to me they can email me at xxxxx, I am using a friend's email for the next month

I feel dumb doing THIS, but I am really freaked here and could use an ear or two to bend"

I don't know why I thought that  I was ok. Maybe because  I had been drug free in my treatment for the last 2 1/2 yrs, or because things didn't seem so chaotic this time before someone noticed  I was  ""different""?

dsf,"Hi everyone. My name is Charlie and I have suffered from occasional bouts of depression for a while. Something that has recently taken my interest is the inferiority complex and how this affected my perceptions of things. I first got onto the idea through a page called Depression Hurts at a Hypnosis site 121 hypnosis (its worth plugging as I have found it useful). It took a while to admit to myself that I was afraid of not belonging, being criticized, sarcastic remarks at work etc and it stems back to horrid teachers and kids at school. This has been a turning point for me though - working through the false learnings and memories, so I thought I'd share it in case it resonates with anyone else. I've since recognized symptoms of inferiority in others (and they vary widely from conceited arrogance to total withdrawal), and it's been really great."
dsf,Well I bought the TENS machine. got it set up earlier and decided I was in SO much pain across my shoulders that I would set it at the neck shoulder setting and on the MOST intense setting due to the pain and the desperation I was feeling. Well that was a mistake it's like being stabbed with a pointy stick - so I reset it to the minimum setting. it has helped a little perhaps I should use it more often to a) get used to the feeling b) get rid of the pain as I am in LESS pain now but it hasn't gone altogether would I recommend one let's just say I need a few more days to decide but for now I am in slightly less pain than I was
dsf,"I was first officially diagnosed as depressed when I was twelve, and had been depressed for two or three years before that, following the death of my younger sister. It took six years before I found an effective medication. During the time I was depressed, I was completely antisocial, had no friends, and was completely oblivious to the outside world. Now I'm eighteen, and I feel like I've missed a decade of social development. I have no friends, and no idea how to make any. It's all well and good to say just be friendly, but I don't know what that means! I can't make small talk, because I have no understanding of fashion, boys, make up, any of the things girls my age are meant to talk about, if that is what they're meant to talk about. Most of the things I know about other people my age I get from books and television, and I have no idea how accurate they are.

Please, I really need help. I've just started attending a 'normal' school (as opposed to a hospital school) for the first time since 8th grade, and I'd like to have friends, I just don't know how to go about it."
dsf,"I have a gripe about pharmaceutical and insurance companies.  You can take up to 450 mg / day of Wellbutrin XL.  The manufacturer makes 150 mg and 300 mg pills, but not a 450 mg pill.  OK, so just take 3 of the 150's, right?  Well if the doctor prescribes it that way, at least one insurance company won't pay for it.  The doctor has to prescribe it as one 300 mg pill plus one 150 mg pill - thereby making the patient have to pay 2 co - payments for what should be one prescription. 

Why doesn't the manufacturer make a 450 mg pill?  And how can the insurance companies get away with forcing doctors to prescribe in what is really a stupid manner?  I know it all comes down to money, but, of course, we patients get the short end of the stick as usual when it comes to the money issue."

dsf,"Hello Tommy! to DF! I'm glad you joined! This board is a great place for information and support. Take your time browsing through the topics. I'm sure there will be lots of things you can relate to. When you feel comfortable enough, feel free to share any of your thoughts, questions, concerns, experiences, etc...Congrats on taking your first steps towards recovery! I think it takes a lot of courage to start treatment. I know it took me quite a while to admit to myself I couldn't handle my situation on my own any longer. I think you did great starting on both talk therapy and medicines! I hope you find therapy useful and that you and your therapist can work towards better skills to cope with the stressors in your life. Concerning your medication. There's a room dedicated to your antidepressant Prozac. You'll find lots of information there. Check it out sometime. One of the downsides of antidepressants is the fact that it takes a while for them to kick in. You only started about 10 days ago so you'll have to give the Prozac some time to be able to fully benefit from it. Meanwhile I hope you're not having too many side effects! Tom, thanks for joining. Keep us posted on how you're doing! Take good care of yourself!"

dsf,"I feel really bad for not coming to the forum much last week. i have been in turmoil. Things at home are not going well at all. My husband got his new house and is moving in the next few weeks ... incidentally that is not the problem. I am happy that he is leaving. He has been a real jerk lately. He says mean things to me and he is angry all of the time. He has been working on the road for the past month so we only have to tolerate each other on the weekends  - thank goodness. When he comes home the first thing that he does is go up to the computer room and say hi to his buddies ... not to me and not to our son (in fact he only spend a total of one hour with our son on the weekends). When he finally graces us with his presence he just complains. I did SO much work around the house last week - I cut the grass, weeded the garden, watered the lawn everyday, vacuumed the house from top to bottom, washed the floors on the main floor of the house, did all of the laundry, patched some dents in the walls and painted them, cleaned out our son's room .... and still he managed to find things that were 'wrong'. He even had the audacity to tell me that I am a pig and nothing gets done around here. I just can't take it anymore. All he does is get angry and complain. I finally realized this weekend that I am not his problem. He is just using me as an excuse. I have tried to talk to him and all he wants to do is play the blame game. We have agreed to not see each other for the month of august so that each of us can decide what it is that we want to do regarding our relationship. Even that ticked him off. When I asked him if he would like me to send our son with his parents when they come to visit him he got mad that I wasn't going to come see him. The 'no seeing each other in August' was entirely his idea. I have no clue what is going on in his head. I have tried and tried to talk to him and the only reply I get is defensive or aggressive. I am at my wits' end and am about to give up. I care very much for him and I know that there is something wrong but I cannot help him. I am so afraid of giving up on us though because I am riddled with the 'what ifs'. I want a family so bad. am I settling though? I hate saying that because my husband is not a terrible man. He has his finer qualities it is just that lately they are few and far between. He has even told me that he would cheat on me if given the chance. And that he might have while drunk one night and that the girl has told other people that the baby she is carrying might be his.
You know the more that I write the more I feel like an idiot. What a
fucking doormat. What the hell am I doing? i am putting my happiness and wellbeing on the back burner for someone who has told me repeatedly that he no longer loves me and thinks that he has had an affair (or at the least would like to). How pathetic can you get. What a glutton for punishment I am. Why is it that I feel that he is more important than me? You know I thought that I was doing better on the medication - I might not be having the emotional outbursts but I still have the low - or should I say non-existent self esteem. If only all of this could be over. If only he could either WAKE up and figure out what he wants to do or just fuck off and never see me or our son again. That would make my life so much easier. I fear for my son. I do not want my husband's anger to hurt our son. I don't want husband to take out his frustrations on a two year old. I worry about sending our son to visit him. Without me there or the dogs, xxxx is the only one there to take the abuse.
Anyway that is what I have been dealing with the past week. As a result of all of this I have been on a self destruct mode. I have not been sleeping, i have been late for work and I have been unprepared many times. I am glad that the last day is this Thursday. i will have a month to 'detox'. I need it."
dsf,"Hi all, I'm new to this forum and am in desperate need for help and advice as I've nowhere else to turn. I'll start at the beginning. I feel that I'm under a lot of stress with my job and the pressures of life. I feel that stress and depression go hand in hand. I'm not sure if I am stressed and depressed or if I have something medically wrong with me. That's where I need advice on what are common symptoms of depression and stress. At first I thought I was anemic as I am pale and don't eat a lot of meat so thought that my dizziness was down to lack of iron in the system. I also get eye strain but put that down to working on computers as a living. I have had blood tests for anemia, diabetes, blood sugar levels and other general tests which all came back fine. I have changed my diet and exercise more. At the moment I suffer from dizziness, eye strain, headaches, lack of concentration, irritability, lethargic and lack of co-ordination. If I'm honest I'm s***ting (Not sure if I can say that) myself as I don't understand what is wrong with me. I have a loving girlfriend and no money problems and a good social life but a stressful (if that's a word) job. Do the symptoms sound like depression and stress related or am I in the wrong ballpark here. Any help is really appreciated"
dsf,"It's been so long since I've been here doubt anyone would remember me!

Lots has been happening.  My job has become busier so I've become more exhausted when I get home and I just don't want to do anything.

Then on March 4 my brother from my adopted mother died of a heart attack so had to go through that experience with my niece, his only daughter.

Then right after that my husband got really sick with pain in his belly.  We took him into emergency and they did a CT scan and could see only massive infection and couldn't tell where it was coming from.  So he was admitted and given antibiotics and scheduled for a colonoscopy.  

He was also very low on potassium so he was given bags of potassium and taking pills on top of that.

His colon was clear so it was determined his gall bladder was diseased and needed to come out.  But right now it was so swollen and infected the surgeon wanted to wait until the infection cleared and swelling went down before he took it out.  So husband is now on a non-fat diet to reduce the swelling and still on antibiotics to clear out the infection.

Fortunately, being vegan, non - fat is not too hard for us to do.  He goes in for a pre - exam on Wednesday and then surgery a week later.

But through all this I haven't been doing my routing of medications and exercise and am suffering for it.  Fibro and migraines have hit me really hard.  I'm still trying to take care of my husband though by preparing his meals.  He lost almost 30 lbs through the last week of this whole episode.

In the meantime, I have an appointment Monday with a neurosurgeon to discuss if something needs to be done with my tethered spinal cord.  I've had it for years and it causes weakness in my legs and pins and needles in my feet.  It could also affect bladder and bowel functions but I haven't had that problem yet. 

I've read that sometimes they cut the end of the spinal cord to get it out of the way of the vertebrae.  I'm not sure how serious my case is but my neurologist thought it was serious enough to send me to surgeons.  It's a rare birth defect I guess found in adults.  Usually they catch it in infants.

So, in a LARGE nutshell, that has been what I've been up to"
dsf,"Hi, I have posted a few responses on the forum, but this will be my first thread. I guess I am wondering if I truly suffer from depression or another mental illness. I have not seen a psychologist or a therapist, but I have been reading your threads for the last few weeks. My heart goes out to you and I wish that I could lend more support than I can. I know that my situation is not nearly as dire as many of you, but I still ponder whether I have a iproblemi. For the last couple of years, I have experienced an increase in mood swings. I will be doing fine and then a ilight switchi goes off, and I get a bad case of the blues. These can last for a few of days. In my mind, I know that everything is actually okay, but I can't shake the idowni feeling. I also have frequent bouts of being istressed-outi. By this I mean that all of the tasks that I need to get done seem to be insurmountable and that there will never be enough time to get things done. I sometimes break down in tears during my more manic attacks of frustration and worry. Life seems to have become one long list of stuff to do. Even the fun stuff has become something to get done so that I can move on to the next day. As for itriggersi, as I have been reading about in your posts, I know that I have two major issues. I don't deal well with my emotions when my husband gets angry (not abusive, just normal iguy angryi) or I feel that I have somehow iscrewed-upi and let him down by not doing something right. I turn very inward and the ilight switchi goes off. My second issues deals with embarrassment. I do not take embarrassment well. My stress/anxiety over getting the housework done stems from my concern that people may come over and I will be embarrassed by the state of the house (in fact, the house is always neat and clean, if a bit disheveled by daily life). I often worry about whether I embarrassed myself during social outings or at parties with my friends. My husband reassures me, but that doesn't usually ease my worry. My ObGyn gave me Sarafem (Prozac 20mg) three weeks ago, and I seem to be operating on a more even keel these days. The lows aren't as low and I seem to be able to let more stuff just roll off my back. I am pleased with the results, and my husband has seen a real improvement, but I am still asking myself the basic question as to whether I am indeed ill. Please provide some feedback if you can, as this is the first time that I have tried to really tell folks about how I feel."
dsf,"My Daughter turned 30 today.  I called and sent her a card, but she is not speaking to me.  Reason being ...
I've helped her and her husband financially for approximately 2  years with the child care payment for my lovely grand daughter (she is 3 years old).
I explained to both of them (daughter and her husband), that I'd have to quit paying half the payment (273.00 per month), after I get my 2005 tax return, because I'm planning on buying a new car.  I need a smaller car, and the one I own is from 1995 SUV.  I gave my older car to my nephew in Arizona.  He was driving a 1985 Toyota with no air conditioning.  He is thrilled to recieved my 1995 Passport (Honda), that has many miles, but no serious problems.
I was babysitting my lovely granddaughter one Saturday night.  When they came home from a party.
 My son in law stunk of weed and he was drunk.  He was hugging his daughter (my granddaughter), while he was stoned and drunk.  I was so disappointed.  I come from the old school that pot is bad.
Being that my daughter was promoted to full time, and they both received a total of 2,000.00 tax return, I figure this is a good time to let them know that I'll no longer be paying for half their child care.
My daughter blames my decision on the night her husband was very stoned ... I tell her that I can't expect ""the best"" for my granddaughter, when her own father doesn't care, as much as I do.  Plus, I had forewarned her that I'll be buying a car soon.  So ... now I have a new car .. but no daughter, and not granddaughter.  None of them are speaking to me. 
I miss my daughter so much, and my granddaughter even more.
please advise."
dsf,"Things seem to follow you everywhere, things such as thinking of suicide and almost doing it. I did these things a few years ago well in a term of service with the US Army and was put in a ward for a few weeks and then released without even a proper name for what ever I was suffering from, and was sent to Iraq a week after leaving the ward. That as I said was a few years ago and I really never wound up in a hospital again yet, after I returned home and since it seems everyone knew I had one little problem. A problem that seems to plague me even to this day for I am now in the reserves and was yet sent to go back to Iraq but I was sent home due to on going mental problems from a few years ago. What I really want to know is there something really wrong with me or is this just a huge joke. I have been to doctors more then once and just with really nothing to go on but a shaken head. so I just was hoping someone out there knows or been though this really, as for my feelings inside it is hard for me to express I do not like to talk much of what goes on up stairs do to at times I don't really understand why at times I either feel like hurting someone or just having that lump in my throat feeling like I am going to cry but I cannot. Anyway answers please and this is my first ever post here I due hope you can read my rambling."
dsf,"NOTES FOR A SUCCESSFUL EFFEXOR WITHDRAWAL

After doing research on this board and others, I prepared the following withdrawal regime and carried it out, making slight adjustments as I went along.  It worked for me, although the withdrawal was not easy.  I share it with you all in gratitude for all your advice and sharing over these past months. I hope it will be a help for you preparing to come off Effexor

1. MY SITUATION:

a. Length of Time of Effexor: 5.5 years

b. Dosage: 150 mg XR

c. Reason for Effexor: TMJ, myofascia and migraines due to a displaced jaw disc, lock jaw and stress.

d. Other medications: Flexeril (periodically over the years but not in past year when things are ""bad""); Trazodone, for sleep; vitamins and herbs as needed.

e. Status: Age: 43, Height 5'-10""; Weight: 160. Married, no kids, work from home.

f. Reasons to Come Off: Generally feeling better with the help of physiotherapist; life situation has become low-stress and stabile (secure job, good marriage, work from home); side effects of Effexor becoming irritating, especially the emotional distance from my own thoughts / emotions; and simply feel that I cannot be on this drug for the rest of my life.

2. MY WITHDRAWAL REGIME

Procedure:

Drop my dosage by 18.75 mg (XR) every two weeks. 4 months total time to get to zero. Divided 37mg pills into two parts to equal 18.75, depositing each part in new empty vegetable gel caps (available at health food store).

In general:

a. No caffeine -- not even decaffeinated coffee.

b. No alcohol.

c. Exercise every day (heartbeat up for 20 minutes or more).

d. Steam Room / Sauna / Hot bath or long hot shower every day.

e. 40-50 hour work weeks, nights / weekends off for ""down time"".

Daily:

a. Vitamins (one dosage each in the morning and night): B Complex (50 mg); C (1000  mg); E (400 iu); Omega (2000 mg); Glucosamine Sulfate; 8 glasses of water.

b. Continued with my Trazodone medication for sleep during entire tapering process, took no Flexeril.

Experience during each tapering of 18.75 mg:

First 24 hours: no side effects.

48 hours: very bad day: grumpy, anger, rage (for someone relatively sweet natured); nausea, dizzy, balance problems, headache; when moving head too quickly would become nauseous; body pains, disrupted sleep with periodic nightmares. The main thing is to be as far from other people as possible since any conversation would rub me the wrong way. Asked wife to take nothing I say personally, agree with whatever I say, or simply ""get out of my way"". Eventually we found sending her away for the day shopping or whatever to be the best. On these days I would plan to do a lot of non - thinking busy work around the house: fix things, garden, etc. Spent extra time at gym and in steam room.

72 hours: very low energy, dopey, foggy, wanting to stay in bed, body pains. My energy would then slowly gain over the next few days. Some of the above side effects would appear briefly without warning between drops in dosage (anger, bad nights sleep, sluggish).

Once at zero mg.:

Symptoms:  All of the above, but slightly increased in all areas.

Acute allergy symptoms -- sneezing, headache, stuffed up from morning to night -- aches and pains. I took Benadryl during this time which helped a lot.

Detox Period:

Now I had to remove the toxins from Effexor from my body. Regime:

a. Steam Room / Sauna / Hot bath or long hot shower twice every day--with cold shower breaks in between heat sessions to mimic the aspects of fever.

b. cleanser: Triphila and Psyllium husk powder twice a day

c. Dry brush my skin (the skin holds a 1/3 of the body's toxins)

d. 5 day juice fast, with 2 days before and after of raw vegetables/fruits only. Stopped all medications, vitamins, benadryl, colon cleanser, everything during this juice fast. I scheduled the fast approximately 2 weeks after stopping Effexor.

e. Exercise regime every day.

3. AM I NOW IN THE CLEAR?

Here I am 4 weeks after the end of Effexor (and Trazadone -- which I replaced with melatonin). I continue to take vitamins and will do so for quite a while. So ... How am I feeling?

- I don't have words to describe how wonderful it is to have my feelings, emotions and mind back, where I feel that my moods are my own and not manufactured by Effexor.

- Allergies continue to haunt me daily, but each day it gets a bit better, and I take less benadryl.

- No need to remember pill times is wonderful, less dry mouth.

- Still a bit ""low energy"", but it gets better each day.

- Mood is upbeat, feeling hopeful and looking forward to clear windshields everyday!

I hope this help those of you out there planning to come off this drug. I am grateful for Effexor for all it has done to help me over the years. I wished they warned me about the withdrawal. I am grateful for all your suggestions and comments that helped me research and put this regime into place. It worked for me and I probably wouldn't change a thing if I were to do it again."
dsf,"I have been dealing with no self confidence and low self esteem for some many years now I can't count them all. Things have really hit rock bottom. After 6 years my partner has left me. At 26 I feel I'm going to die alone. All I want is to settle down, get married and have lots of babies but I pushed him away. Why did I do that?
I see no light at the end of this tunnel. I feel completely alone. I've cried so long and so hard but it doesn't change the empty feeling I have inside me."
dsf,"I've already posted on this forum but  I never really introduced myself.  So here goes:

My name is Amy, and I am 24 years old.  I have two beautiful daughters, ages 5 and 3.  I am also raising my little brother, who is 1.  I have suffered from anxiety attacks since I was 16 and became seriously depressed about 2 years ago.  I was hospitalized once ... when the doctor put me on Zoloft.  Since then I have tried Effexor XR and Klonopin (worked for 8 months) and am supposed to be trying Wellbutrin and Buspar now (scared to start them).  I self - harm when things get too hard for me, and have scars covering much of my left arm due to cutting.  I was recently dismissed from my therapy / psychiatrist due to missed appointments ... and I don't know if I am going to find another one yet.  I think about just letting go sometimes.  Nothing really helps anyways.  The one thing that depresses me the most is my fear of spending the rest of my life alone.  Men seem to think I am only good for one thing ... and I guess I agree.  I hate that I go from being okay ... sometimes for weeks at a time ... and then everything falls apart.  My family supports me ... sometimes.  At least, my mom lets me crash at her house when things are real bad.  My mom and my sister try to be there ... but they get tired of me.  I can't say I had a bad childhood ... I can't remember my childhood.  I went under hypnosis ... had a vision of my dad and became extremely afraid.  I never had a chance to go back and find out why.  Missed too many appointments.  My dad was accused of being abusive (to my mother) and having a violent temper ...  and of molesting my sister and I.  Don't remember.  My dad says my mom left us for two years when I was 2 or 3 years old and was always drunk.  Don't remember.  I spent much of my teen years drunk / high and being promiscuous ... let's just say even my mother knew I had a reputation.  Why?  Don't know.  I have never felt like I belonged ... and the past few years I have felt like I haven't really been living.  Disassociation, I suppose.  I am usually moody, never have any energy, and have started and quit school 3 times to date.  Never accomplished anything but getting my GED ... and the sad thing is ... I'm smart. 

I live day to day ... never knowing if it will be a good day or a bad day.  My daughter had missed a lot of school because I can't seem to get her there by 12 in the afternoon.  My mom says she will help ... but I know I am on my own.  Neither of my daughters' father's are any help.  My dad left my little brother with me in November, sends down some money every month... and hasn't seen him since.  Some days I feel like I am on top of things ... most days I feel like things are on top of me ... and smothering me.  I've started writing my daughters a letter letting them know everything I want them to know when they are older ... just in case I'm not around.  I can't say for sure this won't beat me one day, and I want to be prepared.  I love my kids ... but also believe with all my heart they would be better off without me.  Sure ... they love me and I'm their mommy ... but not all mommies are good mommies and not all mommies deserve to raise children.  Love isn't always enough ... because God (is he even real?) knows I would die / kill for my girls.  I know the answers to nothing and have so many questions.  This is my life ...

Scared to be alone ... but I always am.  I read this somewhere and it sums up how I feel:

I'm not hungry ... but I'm starving.  I'm not tired ... but I'm exhausted.  I'm not bleeding ... but I'm dying.

So hi to everyone who is fighting the same fight ...  I just need to know that I am not alone."
dsf,"Hi, I'm 19 and new here. I've suffered from acute depression for getting on for 18 months now. I currently take Citalopram, having tried Fluoxetine but it wasn't doing much good for me. I self-harmed on-and-off from the age of 16 to 18 and have been stopped since last June. I recently became engaged (on Boxing Day!) and last month emigrated to live with my fiance. I have previously received some CBT for depression and OCD but that stopped when I went to university in Sept 2005. My mental health deteriorated drastically whilst at university and in December I made the decision to leave. I am hoping that I will soon be able to get some counseling or other sort of psychological therapy here, and to start coming off my medication at some point soon, although I don't want to rush that as I don't want a relapse."
dsf,"I have been on 50 mg of Zoloft for 6 months now, and I have the worst night sweats!!!  I haven't had any other side effects from it other than the night sweats, but this side effect is enough!  I get them about every other week and they last for 4 - 5 days.  Sometimes it is so bad that I wake up 3 times a night to change my clothes because I am drenched! 
I just wanted to know if anyone else has had the same experience?  I'm thinking of getting some blood work done to rule out anything else even though my doctor says that it is definitely caused from the Zoloft since I never had this problem before!"
dsf,"This is just the tip of an iceberg. One of my best mates has just gone to prison and he has a girlfriend, last night in the pub a good friend of ours was chatting her up and trying to kiss her so i said to him what are you playing at fellow your best mates inside and your doing this! he didn't even care! so i stormed out of the pub wanting to kick his head in. should i have stuck my nose in or should i have turned a blind eye? i think i did the right thing. We are a good bunch of lads who have been threw thick and thin together . But just lately all of us have been out of order to each other so are we really mates? what are mates? we are all stabbing each other in the back and its getting me down I think its because we are always drunk half of the time what do u guys think? is it all part of getting older? we are all in our early 20s now."
dsf,"Hi, sorry if this turns into a lengthy post, but I could do with some advice, and I think this is probably the best place to ask. Firstly, I should point out, I am a 19 year male. My problem is that I am concerned by the physical effects the depression is having on me. I have probably been suffering from depression for several years, but I only sought medical help last November after I had a breakdown. The doctor has prescribed me with Fluoxetine, and I am taking 40mg per day. I originally started off on 20mg per day, but after I told the doctor what I will tell you now, about 2 months ago, he ""upgraded"" my status to severe depression, hence the increase in dosage. I can appreciate that my mindset is slightly biased towards feeling negative, and expecting the worst, but nevertheless I can't help but feel my symptoms might be the result of an even more serious problem. The medication has helped my mind (even though I still have plenty of lows, they aren't always as severe as they were 6 months ago), yet my physical health is deteriorating to the point where that's the main factor preventing me from accomplishing day to day tasks. My symptoms are as follows (and they may be generalized, I'll admit): Constant fatigue, even after plenty of rest; constant aching throughout the body; generally feeling very weak, lacking energy and strength, e.g. carrying shopping home can leave my arms in agony; loss of coordination, I have become very clumsy, always knocking glasses over, or dropping things for no reason; occasional loss of balance, usually when getting up, or starting to walk from a stand still; joints are feeling slightly stiff, they still move, but I can feel more resistance than normal and they get very tired very quick if was to use them, or even just hold my arms straight out in front of me; and for me, the worst symptom is an almost constant tremor in both hands and arms, which sometimes spreads throughout the body. If I attempt slow, fine movements with my hands, the tremor becomes very clear and results in jerky movements. Also, I like to exercise, yet after all exercises, even low intensity ones, the trembling seems to intensify. I doubt it is anxiety, as I still shake when I am calm, relaxed and immobile. I know I can't expect I diagnosis, but I would appreciate it if anyone can tell me if the severity of the physical effects I am experiencing, is quite common, even when the mental state is much more relaxed and beginning to recover? Thanks for any help"
dsf,"Hi everyone, I am a 39 year old complete mess up. I have suffered from depression most of my life. About 18 years ago my world crashed around my head. I went into blackness like no other. Attempted suicide several time, went through a period of self mutilation, went on every depression drug known to mankind, through years of therapy. This lasted 10 years. I took a massive overdose and was on life support for 5 days. When I finally regained consciousness my doctor told me it was a miracle I was alive. After that I seemed to put my life back on track. I still suffered periods of depression but nothing extreme. Until now that is. Now I feel myself slipping into that hole again and I am terrified."
dsf,"I can absolutely relate to what you're going through. I understand how difficult it is adjusting to so many different personalities. Ten people in one apartment is overwhelming, to say the least. I used to live with four other girls who had diverse interests, and unfortunately we all kept to ourselves because of the different personalities. It was best that way. In your case, it seems like you're making as much effort as you can to be social. There's no need to go out on a limb to prove that you're not anti-social. When I had depression I really needed my space and the last thing I wanted to do was socialize with my roommates. Luckily, I am in my own apartment and have been living alone for three years now. It has helped enormously. I wonder if you can request a transfer to a bachelor suite where you can live by yourself. I did that in my 3rd year and the apartment manager put me on a waiting list, and I was able to get my own living space by November. Even though the moving was a hassle, I never regretted it. As for finding ways to spend time away from the noise of other people, I usually take the bus to visit a bookstore that is far away from campus. I go there every weekend to relax and read. It's away from campus life and it has helped me sort out my thoughts. The suggestions made by others such as the library, and a park are wonderful too. Maybe you can purchase a bus pass? I have depression and social anxiety, so it was difficult dealing with the university atmosphere on my own. I made only a couple of friends who have since moved on or graduated. I too saw a school counselor, but it was short-lived. What helped me, other than getting away from campus, was getting some online support from forums such as this one. I also kind of clung to one friend at a time, instead of many groups of people. I'd go to the movie theatre and watch something funny, or I'd take long walks. You're not alone. Hang in there and keep posting if you feel really down. I think this forum is very supportive and people will try to help you the best way they can."
dsf,I am new here.  Decided to look up some info on the withdrawal effect of Effexor and decided that it was time to check out support as well.  I have suffered from depression since I was very young but was not diagnosed until my early twenties (I am 33 now)  I was not medicated until my husband decided he didn't want to be married anymore and the bottom fell out of my life.  At the time I needed something to help balance me out a bit.  I should have been medicated a long time ago :)  I still have times where it hits me but not nearly as severe as it used to.  I describe it as my black cloud coming over me.  I tell people when it's there as I am very open about my depression as I feel it may help someone else.
dsf,"Nice to see you too!!! How are you today? I think you really have hit the mark on what I was trying to express with this question - all the negativity and darkness that is contained in almost every media outlet you can name. The disasters you mention, such real human tragedy but the way the media went after it was appalling and seemed to be muddled in politics and ratings. As for those forensic shows - ugh! I used to be able to watch them but way before this recent ""episode"" of mine I stopped. I couldn't stand the heartache of knowing what evil lurks out there. Where I work now one of the first friends I made was a gentleman who has since retired. He told me that he didn't read the news, watch TV or listen to the radio (except for light jazz) because he found that to do so was just too much pain, it did not ""serve"" him to subject himself to that kind of pain. He seemed to be generally very happy and upbeat to me so there must be something to it. As for your friend - that's a tough one but maybe since she is your friend she might understand if you explain to her how incredibly painful her TV choices are on you. Does she ever read or post here? Anyway, it is GREAT talking with you again and I look forward to the next chat. I hope you have a wonderful day and weekend."

dsf,"Well, I guess, i mean i know I need help. I lost my husband . he died of a heart attack at 56 on his walk home from a police station from being arrested for soliciting a prostitute., two years ago, can't get over it. It was a bad scene, we were not great lovers or anything like that, more like companions, he cheated on me a lot and i just accepted it, but we did things together, ate out a lot, went to flea markets, he was nice to me, he loved me , he was just stupid, and i wouldn't have sex with him because of his indiscretion, I think he understood that.

After he died, about 6 months or so, I started going to a psychiatrist. He put me on lots of medications, it cost a lot of money, I was still depressed somewhat and really, I don't think he understood me at all. So about 6 months ago, I quit, everything, medications, therapy, etc.

I have a 30 year old son that lives with me and causes me a lot of grief, he has diabetes really bad and no job. Two days ago he was lethargic and his blood sugar was 500, I had to take him to the ER and I know it's going to cost me thousands of dollars. I have no extra money, but what does a person do. I tried to get him to get a job and it just turns into a yelling crying i am going to through you out of the house thing ... He is my child, I won't throw him out , .. oh, he also has adult ADD.

I have a real hard time socializing because i have low self esteem, I am fat, 53 years old, not very attractive, and on and on. When I try to improve myself, I get frustrated, the weight , .... etc.

I think about suicide but that is stupid, I never act on anything like that. It's just a passing though time to time. I cry a lot, I am alone a lot.

All messed up huh."

I was pretty heavily involved in music and martial arts for years, but I'm no longer motivated to do either. I'm still going to school, though I have no real direction and I'm afraid that my lack of motivation is going to cause me to screw that up too.  I started having anxiety attacks about a year ago and they've increased in frequency the last few months. They're (not to sound melodramatic) the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with. If I'm in panic-attack mode, any slight pain or discomfort quickly becomes a life-threatening illness that is surely going to kill me in the next few minutes. As ridiculous as that sounds, it's absolutely real when it's happening and I live in almost constant fear it's going to happen again. I have a hard time even driving anymore (especially on the freeway) and increasingly rely on my girlfriend for menial things like going to the store. She is very supportive and is aware that something is wrong, though I don't think she understands to what extent. I've started completely avoiding any situation in which I have to meet new people and have a hard time even talking to people I don't know on the phone. These symptoms have been increasing in intensity over the last 6 months or so and exponentially for the last 3 weeks (I just lost my job). It seems like quite a few of you have been dealing with these sorts of things for much longer and I'm sorry if my posting here so soon seems insensitive, but its already getting to the point where I know I can't handle living like this for years on end. I've suffered from depression for (relative to my age) a long time and the anxiety attacks are absolutely terrifying (a little redundant, I know). It feels like the last year is the beginning of everything completely falling apart. I guess my posting here is a way to get the ball rolling towards getting some help. I don't have health insurance anymore and I'm not sure where to go from here. I've been medicated in the past, but I haven't taken anything in a few years. Though, without insurance I'm not even sure that's an option. That's enough for now. Thanks for providing a resource like this. The anonymity of the internet lets me say some of the things I'm afraid to say to everyone else."
dsf,"I am so very angry. It is eating me up. I am sick of it. It is not healthy. It costs me a lot.
Yet even this makes me angry! rrARGGG! I feel like the female version of the Hulk.

Do you know how it feels to go through the cycles of feeling nuts / alone to gaining a semblance of normalcy?
Well, that makes me angry.
I get angry when I start to get happy. I get angry when I start to feel sad. I get angry when someone shows me love. I get angry when things go well. I get angry when things don't go well.
I get angry, I get angry, I get angry.

This weekend I had this clear clear vision. I was immediately present for the first time in a long time. I felt, I breathed, I listened, I laughed. I saw. And I got very very angry.

I do not belong where I am. I do not belong. I screwed up, I fell asleep, I got depressed; and now Look at all that has changed! Nothing is the same; and I feel like I have traveled through a million miles of time in one short weekend.

This is all too much. Who the hell am I? How did I get here? What am I going to do now? Shit!!

All this time I believed I could do it alone. All this time I tried to be strong. All this time I tried to put others before myself; no matter what the cost.
Now I am alone. I am like a ghost of myself. When I speak, what comes out is all wrong. I am nothing like I used to be. I am scared, I am torn, and I am alone.

My old friend looks to me: you're so great. You are here for me and you are strong.
Blah blah blah ....... in reality we are just too lost souls traveling the highways alone. If I see you, I see you.
But you aren't going be there for my funeral. You'll probably not even know when and where it is. You'll sleep through it and read about in the newspaper or some shit. You'll cry to the person next to you, and that will be that.

Family looks at me and says ""oh we love you so much. You are so strong and what? Are you going through creative or man pains again?""
Gee, I love you too. But you are not the answer. WE are just traveling the highways alone.
You keep looking for the answer. I know there aren't no answer. We are alone: wine song and comforting arms and all.

I am angry because I know this journey is mine and I am not doing so hot. I get disorientated, I get distracted, I screw up. And you know what?! That's ok.

thanks; I needed a good angry rant :) Maybe there is someone out there who doesn't find this completely insane. If I don't speak it, it will stay inside and explode in some other form."

Here's my problem though: she's still in high school. and ever since i moved away to university i have been constantly constantly worrying about things i can't control. like when she drinks with her friends, and whether or not I'll still love her in a month, whether or not she's going to suddenly ask herself ""what am i doing in a long distance relationship anyway?"". these are all ridiculous things to worry about. not only because she loves me to the ends of the earth, but because i have ZERO control over them. these worries are driving me insane and slowly ripping up our relationship. does anyone have any advice to offer?"
dsf,"i am 29 and a mother of three children ages 11, 6, and 2. i have been severely depressed for like my whole life even  when i was in kindergarten i was different i cried all day every day. i have been through so many what i consider to be stages in my depression from like 14 - 17 i suffered from eating disorders and i was a cutter as well then i started having these horrible panic attacks i have spent the good part of the last  10 years dealing with that i have tried many different medication prozac, paxil, buspar and have been on zoloft 50 mg for 2 months it has helped a little but not much i am still horrified to leave my home , scared to be alone , needless to say i have no social life. i just wonder if there really is any hope out there and would love someone to talk to that knows where i am coming from"
dsf,"i'm new here, i'm 26 years old and i have been taking effexor for 4 years now. i have struggled with insomnia, and taken just about everything out there (trazadone, seroquil, lorazepam, clonazapam ...) i have been on remeron for a month now, 30 mg at night and i find it works well but i am worried about the side effects, particularly weight gain, i have noticed my appetite has increased, any tips? i hate to go off, since it actually works. i would appreciate any advice. also, my sex drive has become a big fat zero lately, and that is very odd for me. i am single right now, but i can't even imagine having sex with anyone including myself!! i've asked about wellbutrin, but was turned down by my doctor who didn't think it would be right for me. any thoughts?"
dsf,"Whatever happened to Doctor - patient confidentiality???  I applied for short term disability because depression is affecting my job and I am barely function - able at work. The insurance company made me sign a waiver of privacy to both my therapist and psychiatrist.  Now they can call them up and ask anything they want!!

The insurance company called me yesterday for a telephone ""interview""! They wanted me to explain why I needed the time off, what my symptoms are, how long have I been like this, really personal questions .......  They are going to be the ones who determine whether I can get disability pay or not! Whatever happened to just taking the word of the doctor??

I wonder who the insurance company can tell? I forgot to ask them if this is going to be kept confidential.  They also asked how this is affecting my job, I felt if I gave the ""wrong"" answer, they will decide not to pay me.

I wonder what they are going to ask my shrinks, and how much info the shrinks can give them.

Also, I understand that the shrinks / therapists can break the confidentiality rule if you threaten to hurt yourself or another --- that I can understand, but if you are ever on trial for something they can subpoena the doctors and they have to tell ALL!  That is ridiculous!  What happens if I am just a witness to some crime, but did not do the crime.  What happens if the lawyers want to discredit me so they put my shrink on the stand to ask what a nut I am?

Just ranting, but opinions, feedback would be appreciated."
dsf,"I found out  I  had depression about 10 years ago. But looking back I had it since i was a teen.

I've tried suicide about 4 times. As you can see that didn't work.

I have 2 kids, one is 21 and the other is 14. I've been married for 11 years this year. They know I have depression, but it's my problem not theirs. I wake up every morning thinking about killing my self and I go to bed thinking about killing myself. I sit around and cry all day. I don't like to leave my house, and I don't unless I really have to. I am overweight, 39, and very alone in this world. My family tries to stay away from me, they don't talk to me unless they have to. My 14 year old is totally afraid of me, I can see it in her eyes. My 21 year old is bipolar, which makes him more screwed up than I am. He throws me into a panic attack every time I get around him. I have been on all of the medications out there, nothing seems to work for me. They just make me sleep a lot. I went to therapy for about 7 years. That really didn't work either. I just started back last month. I hope it helps me this time."
dsf,"Hi everybody. New member have been lurking for a while thought I would introduce myself. My name is Phil, have had depression all my life or as far back as I can recall. Why is it so hard to admit to yourself that you even have it? Any way I have been looking on internet for some info and come across this site which looks very friendly and inviting. I am taking citalopram at present and waiting to see a psychologist but she says I am not ready for her help which is very frustrating she says I wouldn't be able to function if she started therapy with me.  I work full time so I guess it is for the best. I am beginning to understand about depression a bit more now it would be nice to here from anybody out there who has suffered from depression and have found practical ways to deal with it. How do you get out of the dark hole, how do you feel like you are partaking in life and not just spectating. Anyway nice to know I am not the only one I do not feel so much of an alien now. Bye 4 now Phil."
dsf,"Hello I'm 25 from the UK, I have suffered from depression I would say most of my life, but have only been on medicines (20mg of Prozac) for just over 2 years on and off, I've had times off the medicines and relapsed back into depression and the last time I saw my doctor he said It would be better for me to stay on antidepressants long term. The Prozac is working for me at the moment However I find the medicines interrupt my sleep and I wake 3 or 4 times a night and the sleep I do get is very light and ""dreamy"" sleep, plus I seem to be a bit lightheaded and reckless, on my motorbike for example I do stupid things like speeding and other dangerous stuff (to myself not others), which before off the medicines I would never do because I was very paranoid and cautious. I was off Prozac for a while late last year and things went down hill fast, I was cutting my arms and wanted to kill myself, I felt I had no reason to live, I was drinking to relive the depression, and I was drinking about 10 to 12 cans of lager(or 3 bottles of wine) a night, thinking about it I was wrecking my liver and feeling even more depressed in the morning, plus I was putting on loads of weight with all the beers, which was another reason to make me feel like crap. After New Year I made the decision (with my doctor) to go back on the antidepressants, and cut the booze almost out (I still drink about 1 or 2 a night but that's all) because things could not get any worse. I feel a lot better, I am back in the gym and getting back into shape, and my job is going well, I am in a recovery stage at the moment, I just hope I don't f--k it up again like before. Anyway I hope everybody on here is ok. Warm Regards to you all"
dsf,"'I promised I'd post regarding what I perceived to be a meltdown.
As previously posted, I told all y'all that I'd been taking Neurontin.
Since it wasn't prescribed for seizures but for sleep, insurance would no longer cover it because they said it didn't fit into the category of antidepressants or psychotropics, and so on and so forth. All red tape.

So, the Neurontin was stopped, through no fault of my own.
Well, this disturbed my therapist.
So, after almost 6 weeks off of the Neurontin, during which each week I seemed to be going more off the deep end. Meaning, I couldn't sleep, eat, had the shakes, horrific mood swings, unable to think positive about myself, and piggyback panic attacks and I subsequently was going off on some crying gig, etc.

So, on the 22nd when I saw my doctor she said with everything I was describing, that indeed I was having withdrawals. Like Duh, I already knew that. It seems the combination of the meds I was on was balancing me out and the mere change in the medicine did in fact change the way the other meds worked, or didn't work.
Since I'm so hypersensitive to just about every medication, (it took forever to find the right medications and dosages to keep me on the straight and narrow) the doctor said she'd like for me to go back to the psychiatrist that originally prescribed the medications and see if they'd try another antidepressant.
Another one? That didn't set well with me and I guess I was at the end of my rope.
I broke down and ended up staying at the doctor's office for almost two hours while they had to give me a pill to calm me down.
I felt so vulnerable and of course in my state of mind I perceived this as another crisis. I also felt extremely 'stupid' for breaking down that way.
That is why I said I had a ""meltdown.""

There wasn't much I could physically do on Thursday, but, I knew I had to come back to earth. After calming down, thanks to their ""cocktail pill"", which I didn't ask its name. I agreed to see the psychiatrist. What choice did I have. I think the crying episode happened because I remembered all the bad events that happened while they were trying to find the right meds that would balance me out.
It's scary. Of course while I was at the doctor's, I kept asking stupid questions like, ""why do I have to be on anything?""

Is that denial or what?

So, to cut this short. I'll be going to the psychiatrist as soon as they can fit me in.

But I need some help.
I'm asking any of my friends here to give me any input you want. I've been doing pretty good the last couple of days doing the cognitive thinking and just staying busy. It's the down time that's unsettling. And obviously, if you see the time this is being posted, you know I'm not sleeping much.
I am thinking positive.
My doctor called me Friday to check on me. That was surprising. A doctor really calling back. So, seeing how she's my 'new' doctor, maybe we'll be compatible after all.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and for anything you'd like to add to help.

I really appreciate all of you and the joy I receive from reading and writing to you all means a lot to me. Your kindness means so much."
dsf,"I had a lousy night. I went to a street dance with my PARENTS, and was just so alone. I have been single for two months, and meeting new guys in my small town is so hard. I don't drink or do drugs, and that's all a lot of them do. I work an evening shirt at the local factory, and I can't seem to find anyone with the same interests and values as me. I'm really in to horses and the outdoors and everyone my age just seems to want to get drunk and party. I'm already depressed, and this whole thing is just not helping. I'm close to my parents, and I love spending time with them, but I'm afraid guys just see me as some loser who can't grow up or something. Does anyone have any advice on how to just meet people who aren't into parting? Does anyone else come from small towns with this same problem! Thanks bunches."
dsf,"I had therapy today. I don't even know where to start. First off, I lost a day last week (time loss/dissociation)...it was last Tuesday that I lost. My mom called me Friday and I said ""why are you calling me"" and she said ""I always call you on Friday"". I told her that it was Thursday and she told me I was wrong. So, I back tracked the best I could and I can't remember anything that I did on Tuesday. The interesting thing is that I mailed my therapist the research info I found on dissociation so when I saw her today I asked her what was the date that I put on the letter I sent and guess what...IT WAS TUESDAY. Then she asked me if I brought it in and I told her no that I mailed it. And she said that I couldn't have because it wasn't scanned by the post office. She showed me the envelope and it wasn't scanned at all. She also said that the mail had already come in the office and the envelope was in her mailbox way after she had already checked her mail. So, we have no idea how that got to her office. But I don't drive and Carol didn't take me anywhere last week. So, if anyone remembers being with me or talking to me Tuesday...COULD YOU HELP ME OUT PLEASE. My therapist looked over the information that I sent her and she said that everything basically fits with what I'm going through and DID. The problem is, she doesn't treat dissociative disorders and has no idea how to even help me. I appreciated her honesty though. But she said she knows a therapist in Jeffersonville, IN...oh God...that treats dissociative patients but I don't drive and Carol's not going to take me over to Jville on a weekly basis for therapy. Also, we've never even been over there before so we'd get lost. So, she then called her boss and another lady to see if they knew who else in Louisville could help me and to see if she can get some help on treating me. I also gave her more info on some of the things I'm dealing with and the voices that are going on. I even gave her the names of the two that I already know of. She said the fact that I can't remember my childhood and that I not only lose time for minutes but also for days that it isn't normal and we need to figure out how to help me. I've been in the mental health system since 2001 and have had just about every diagnosis slapped on me. I hope I can finally get some help. I'm honestly about to give up. She also said that she's going to see if they can take me off the Seroquel since it's making me sick and NOT WORKING. So, she asked me what else I've been on and I told her (Haldol - didn't work, Risperdal - didn't work, Zyprexa - didn't work, Paxil/Paxil CR - worked for a little bit then wore off, Wellbutrin - didn't work). She said that she wants to try Depakote, Abilify, or another mood stabilizer. I also took those two journal entries in that I posted last week so she could read them. And, I wish I could get it scanned but it didn't look right to me so I can't show them to you (that's why I just typed it) and she said that one of the interesting things that stood out about the entries is that the handwriting was different in three places. I'm a mess. But believe it or not, after today's session I am a little hopeful. In other news, Carol and I have started working on our book of poetry. We've been throwing around ideas all day and working out some details. We're in the process of getting the poems we want to be in the book together and coming up with a title (which we have already done). We're also working on the different categories that we want the poems to fall under. I've been working around with PagePlus for a couple of hours now trying to figure out how we can set this up. She also has a list of publishers that we're going to be going through as well. I'm also still working on getting around to doing some updates on my webpage and trying to budget out how I can pay for my site so I can get more space and get rid of those damn banner ads. I'm moving as fast as I can but right now I'm having some sinus issues (again)."
dsf,"I'm 22 years old, a proud mom of a beautiful little girl who's almost 2 and she is the only good thing in my life.  We live with my parents and that just makes me feel like such a failure, that I can't provide for my child.  I love her to death but she was an accident and I do wonder what it would be like if I didn't have that responsibility, I always tell myself that I'm sure lots of young single moms think that way as long as I'm there for her it's okay.  I've been seeing my neighbor for 8 months now, he's 9 years older then me and my daughter has grown attached to him and I am so in love with him. But I don't know what to do everything is so messed up with him and I, it just seems like he stopped caring and I feel like I'm not good enough for him, for anybody.  I don't have anyone I feel like I can talk to and this is all new to me so now I feel like I'm rambling on about stupid things when there are other people out there with worse problems then me, but I'm just so sad and don't know what to do...."
dsf,"I have had depression for at least 5 years now. I have been with my partner for 2 years and in that time i have come to depend on him for a lot of things - everyday things like making phone calls for me etc. because i find it too hard. In the last couple of months, friends / family have seen him out with another girl, they were closer than they should've been, i have also seen it with my own eyes. Since i have noticed this, our relationship has deteriorated a lot, to the point that we are fighting every weekend, and during the week because he is always wanting to go to his friends house (who is this girl's brother). Today, he has been really angry and agro at me. He has told me to go away and that he has been avoiding me on purpose. I feel like if we broke up my life would be ruined. I feel like i need him to survive. Every time we have come close to breaking up, it ends up me begging him not to leave. We live together which makes things harder. I have no friends left because i was so dependant on him and they got sick of me not seeing them. It's easy to say break up with him, but if you understood how attached i am you would know its not so easy. I don't know what to do. I think he is cheating on me but i need him ... does anyone have any advice? I am lost ... I don't know what to do anymore."
dsf,"I'm new here. But, I would like to know how to tell if I'm in depression. I have no idea where to post this at, but since I'm new here I guess this is the best place. Plus I can't start a new topic so... Well, anyway, here's how it is: Some days I can go without thinking about her, but at night, when I rest my head on my pillow, she eventually runs across my mind. When I say she, I mean my ex. More like.... I'm her ex. But eh... this took place a while back. Maybe like.... a year and a half. I met her 3 years ago in High-school. She was my very first true girlfriend and I didn't want anything to mess that up, but somehow I did that myself... or something along those lines. After a while of missing someone it doesn't really matter who was the blame for what. Sometimes when I make music I sing lyrics about her and how I want another chance and whatever. I'm not really obsessed with her or anything, but I sometimes want to just forget about her all at once, or wish I could go back 3 years. I guess that might be linked to regrets? Anyway, this whole thing is sort of an ON-OFF type thing, where sometimes I can't help but think about how it was, and sometimes, she's that last thing on my mind. Sort of like I put her on the back of my mind not to think about her, and save my hurt of later?? ... If that sounds right... Maybe I need a shrink. Who knows.... maybe i just need another girl.... But I'm pretty sure no other girl is going to want to listen to me talk about my past relationships. Anyway, feedback is appreciated"
dsf,"What a great topic!! The news always makes me cry - and I end up turning it off shortly after I start watching it - why do I punish myself? My parents know that I have learned to not watch the news because of the negative effect it has on me, so if something really important is going on, they let me know. My Aunt suffers from chronic depression and delusion, and I've had numerous conversations with her on how to handle the depression because she's tried so many different things, even going to Mexico to see a Shaman. Her top 3 suggestions (and I really go by them as much as I possibly can) are: 1) Get proper sleep - this is probably the most paramount point; 2) get proper nutrition; and 3) don't watch the news. The one thing that I absolutely cannot tolerate is sad news about animals - that really sends me. When I'm flipping thru channels and happen upon Animal Planet and the Animal Police are busting people because of their cruelty - I have to turn it immediately. I think I'm delusional too in that I choose not to watch the news, animal stories, anything really unpleasant - I guess I try to live in my little world without negativity or sadness. I know that it isn't very mature or adult, but this is my coping mechanism. I do find that when I hear or see anything sad or awful that my negativity really gets into gear, and then I'm completely negative for awhile. Driving is also incredibly difficult because I commute into Washington D.C. from the suburbs and traffic is awful. I become so negative about the other drivers around me that I end up hating myself over my thoughts about them! They, of course, drive too slow and are idiots. I need to find a job close to home! I too have sometimes felt that the human race needs to think about not populating the world anymore. I wouldn't want to raise a small child in this environment any more! I'm glad my son is in college and he's the only one that I could have. But then again, I can't wait until my sister or brother has kids so that I can be with them and spoil them rotten. Crazy isn't it? I have taken others suggestions in this thread and have tried to make myself think positively the last 2 days. It's difficult but possible! I notice that my mood has brightened somewhat too. Thanks to you all for this thread, as I think it really can help!"
dsf,"Alright, this is a bit weird to explain, but I am having a lot of trouble making this decision so I am going to try and write it down. If anyone has any suggestions or advice to offer I would appreciate it. A while back my brother and I let a stray cat in and fed it, and we got really attached to it. It is probably the most needy animal I have ever met and will sit with people all day, loves it when you pet it, and I really like the cat. I wasn't thinking at the time, but later I realized I needed to pay a pet deposit like the rest of the people in my complex, so I could keep the cat. So my mother called up our landlord's office and they said that we could not have the cat. It seems really unfair to me that everyone else is allowed animals, but for some reason we are not. I don't think there is anything I can do about this and it makes me really sad. We didn't want to get rid of the cat so bad that we decided to hide the cat away, letting it inside only at night, and living in my brother's van in the day while we were looking to see if there was somewhere else we could move to. The problem is, I think I would only barely have enough money to move and I think it would be too risky that my family would lose our assistance if we were to go through with such a thing. Not to mention that I keep my spare money around in the case of emergencies and if something bad were to happen, I wouldn't be able to deal with it financially. So the only option I know of that is left is the animal shelter and I really do not want my cat to be locked up and possibly die alone in a cage. I know that it is getting old and that people take younger cats from animal shelters much more often than older ones. I want my cat to have a good place to live and don't want it to spend its final years in a cage, without loving owners. I am having so much trouble making this decision... I love my cat a lot and want it to be taken care of well and to be happy, but I am endangering my family the longer I try to hide it. My mother and brother keep telling me that it is my decision to make and I just keep procrastinating. So I posted this here because it is making me depressed and stressed out. Are there any options I am leaving out? Do I either have to spend all of my money to move or give it to an animal shelter? They both seem like such terrible options"
dsf,"On Monday I plan to finally go and get help from a Doctor but I still haven't told anyone I know how I'm feeling. It's not because I don't want to it's just because I'm scared my parents won't take me seriously or think they have done something wrong bring me up. To tell you the truth I couldn't care what other people think of me but I'm just really worried what my family will think. I'm the oldest of 3 and when I was at school my dad pushed me hard to do well in studies and all that crap but now I'm older and have done nothing at all with my life I still don't know what to do with it. I was even at college for a year but quit after a year because I couldn't seam to keep up no matter what I did. Anyway I'm totally going off the point, I was just wondering if anyone would share with me how they managed to tell there parents? May sound stupid but this is just the hardest thing for me to do but I feel I really need to if I ever want to get over this!"
dsf,"hi, I'm a 21 year-old male from the uk, over the past few months I have become increasingly depressed.  I'm always acting the joker and appear to be happy at university and work but every night I go to bed and hope that I won't wake up in the morning. For the past 3 or 4 years I've had an overwhelming feeling that I won't live very long and over the past few months I have the sensation that I will die very soon. my depression also leads me to get very angered.  I've never spoken to anyone about this."
dsf,"I've had a rough time of things lately, which is partly what made me search for this site. I've had recurrent unipolar depression since my mid teens with an associated anxiety disorder and a panic disorder that took root 5 years ago after I beat a drink problem I had at the time (between the age of 22 and 25 I used alcohol as a bit of a crutch which was a huge mistake). Anyway these days I am teetotal, on anti depressants and only really get a bad time with my depression A during the winter months or B if something triggers an episode (circumstantial). Usually it lifts up in the summer months (I think I might get a bit of SAD) but last year my mother passed away on the 23rd of March and it caused a huge crash in my mood which never lifted in time before the winter episode took hold. I dealt with it by comfort eating (I do comfort eat at times, but I also get bad food cravings in the winter for foods such as chocolate, cheese and carbohydrates, so pizza and chocolate ice-cream became my regular fodder for a while). Anyway that lead to weight gain which is besides the point but which I was planning on correcting (as I have done before) this summer when the food cravings wear off and my mood lifted. Unfortunately it's not lifted as of yet due to recent circumstances. Not only did I have the first anniversary of my mother's death to deal with, but my partner whom I loved very much decided that this would be the best time to dump me and completely rip me to shreds in the process. He basically emailed (he lives in another city) a few days before the anniversary of her death saying he wanted to end it. I tried to contact him but he wouldn't talk on the telephone or by voice, and would not respond to any emails I sent him. He then contacted me by IM on the day of her anniversary (23rd March) to rip me to shreds and tell me that he couldn't love someone like me before posting publicly on his journal running me down before posting disturbing replies to some of the posts on my journal anonymously (but I recognized his ISP number so I know it was him even though he denied it) making it sound as though the whole thing was deliberate. I wouldn't mind but it came out of the blue, the night before all this started he was discussing a work transfer to move to where I am and signed off with 'I love you'. Next day, wham. I'm social phobic so don't really have many friends I cant talk to about this, my mother was usually the one id turn to but she isn't here anymore, so my mood, although it usually lifts at this time of year, has taken a nose dive and I'm having trouble getting myself motivated again. The emotional pain I felt on that Thursday was like nothing I had felt for years, I just literally felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest. I couldn't sleep and I couldn't eat for the best part of that week, although I'm eating and sleeping again now. Am I over reacting to what he did, because I'm hurt as hell and completely and utterly infuriated with him at the same time? I know I can be slightly prone to being a bit of a drama queen at times (over reacting to stuff) and I can sometimes be a little paranoid. But the whole thing felt deliberate as though he intentionally intended to hurt me, and even now when I try to contact him to get answers he is being spiteful and running me down. Of course after this I spat a whole load of vitriol at him and now I'm being painted as the one that was in the wrong, and he is saying he did nothing that warranted the vitriol and is the innocent party in all of this. Of course he also interprets home truths as vitriol, and I tend to be very open and say things as I see them, to the point of lacking tact now and again. But whilst I'm willing to stand up and say I made a few mistakes and apologize, he is acting as though the blame is all mine and he did nothing wrong. I just can't seem to make him understand that the way he went about ending the relationship was one of the most hurtful ways anyone could have done it. I know he claims to suffer from bipolar disorder which he wont get treatment for, and I know that can make him highly moody, but I cant understand why he doesn't understand the hurt he caused me, or if he does, how someone who professed to love me, doesn't even seem to care. He seems totally and utterly cold, so cold it's chilling. I know he gets periods of emotional flatness because he told me, and he also told me he hears voices as well. Could he be suffering from some kind of depression related psychosis? One post he made to my journal was: Wisdom comes only to those who seek it, and sometimes to those who deserve it regardless of perfection, intent or even understanding. The common denominator though, seems to be deed. For one must do, or be done to, in order for wisdom to take root. Am I misreading that? Or reading into it? So am I over reacting? Was I wrong to argue back with him? How can I move on and get my motivation back again?"
dsf,"Ok, so i've had depression for at least 4 years and it has gotten a lot worse the past two. My mom tried shoving prozac down my throat and swore that it helped me, but it didn't. I didn't talk to a counselor until about a month a go.  I was going to school and every time i went to main campus i would get Ds and Fs. I would start out ok but then end up sleeping more and more. This past quarter i physically could not get out of bed at one point. My parents just saw it as me blowing my last chance at college and took it as i didn't care. It seems like i don't feel anymore. I do care that i blew my last chance at college and i finally decided to see a counselor 3 weeks before the end of the quarter. My parents said the only reason i did that is because i knew i was in trouble and just needed an excuse. I don't know why i don't do the things i know i should be doing. I just feel like i can't. My parents say it's all my fault, that i don't take responsibility for anything and I just want to blame everything on something else. Which isn't the case. They don't think that depression has anything to do with not trying, that it doesn't affect rational decision making. I'm starting to think it doesn't either. I mean, why can't i do the things i know I'm suppose to do? The things that will better my life. The things that will make my parents proud? Is it the depression or am I truly lazy and just don't care??? Because everything my parents are saying is making me think it really is just me and i don't have depression."
dsf,"It's been a while since I've written and I decided to start off again with a bit of a bang. I'm going to post my story of beginning recovery, this is to try and cheer some people up and to let them know that they could do it too. Well now, where to start.... About a year and a half ago (the beginning of Grade 8) is when I started to notice the changes. Not physical but emotional. I had been told many times that this was very normal for teenagers so I thought nothing of it. There was an incident with a rather immature and nasty young man, who I just happened to have an ENORMOUS crush on. Anyway we both kind of lead each other on for a while but nothing happened, than he meet this girl at a hockey game. He immediately started talking about her all the time and how he really loved her so much.  I began to feel more and more useless. After that I started rolling down hill like a circle of cheese, and by March of that year I was quite close to suicide at several occasions. This is when I started noticing that this might not be normal and tried many self-help methods, all of which failed. I thought Grade 9 could be a new beginning, it wasn't. My grades were starting to slip and I just couldn't be happy anymore. Finally after a close call in December I told my mum all about my failed attempts and how I was feeling. She agreed to get me a new doctor. I visited her and I got diagnosed with depression and was prescribed Cipralex. Of course that took a while to work too which involved me missing a lot of school, falling really far behind, and having several more close calls. Finally I started feeling a little better and was even stable enough to start going back to school and going to visit my family in the East. Well I just got back from that trip and I have never felt better. I am ready to face the world. That trip was just what I needed. When I get through these next weeks until my birthday all I can see is a varely clear path ahead! For the first time in a year and a half I can concentrate and tolerate less than perfect circumstances. I hope everyone here will feel this way, you can if you just push through! Power to us! Rock on!"
dsf,"Here's a new update for interested readers. Bad news first: I got a voicemail last week, it said my mother was in the hospital. It took me awhile to get more info, I called and left a message where she lived because it was too late to get anyone on the phone there. I finally found out where she was and called the hospital. They said she was having problems walking, that maybe she hurt her back. That she was getting breathing treatments because she had trouble breathing. Part of it was she couldn't smoke, part of it was probably because she does smoke. They didn't seem to find out what caused the problem with her legs. Then she had some other stuff wrong. Part of the good news was one thing they thought was wrong was caused by a shot they gave her, and it was solved the next day. Now, I called her Friday and she said her heart test showed a tear in a valve. She is getting a more detailed test next week, the doctor said it is too early to tell how serious it is or if it needs anything done to it. He told her, it could be just something minor that needs to be monitored and could cause no problems at all or it could require heart surgery. So I was very worried about that. My first thought when I heard she was in the hospital was that she would end up having cancer from smoking, or liver disease from drinking. But I didn't think of any heart problems. I am hoping that it won't be anything serious, or that if she needs surgery that it will be successful and she will recover without any complications. I don't know much about heart surgery, I know I've heart that many bypass patients have good surgery but get sick and die from complications after the surgery. I hope and pray that she will be ok, I live far from her and can't do anything but call her and pray. Now some good news, my new job is going to switch me to fulltime hours next week. I still have to find out if it will be temporary or long-term, but I'm happy either way. I went from poor and going to be homeless, to having a place to live and a low-stress job in a short time. Each day I wake up and am alive and have a place to live means a lot to me now. It kind of gives me a better perspective on life in a way. I know so many people have it worse, so much suffering in the world and I'm lucky. I have to get some new clothes because changing to fulltime I have to go by a different dress code, so I'll be looking for cheap nice clothes tomorrow. I'm thankful I have some money to look for clothes. I'm still adjusting to things, sometimes I feel like ""where am I, what's going on?"" but it is better than before when I was at my apartment thinking ""when will I get kicked out, where will I live?"" I'm trying to take it one step at a time, not worry about where I'm supposed to be going in life. I'm thinking, what do I need, get things stable, be able to support yourself, get a phone, get car insurance, get more hours at work etc... I try to stay positive and be grateful, but still I'm a little lost. If anyone wants more details about things, or advice on how I've coped with anything just leave a reply and I'll answer you. I have a lot of things I've learned and advice, but I don't go around telling people what to do or pushing my point of view. I try to just express myself without pushing."
dsf,"I'm new here. I had been having a lot of problems with anxiety/depression and that was affecting my job a lot. I went out of work for a week hoping that maybe that would help. I felt like I was doing ok and that the relaxing was really helping but the night before I was supposed to go back to work it all happened again. So I pretty much came to the realization that I can't do it without medicines. Is this normal to think you are ok and then have it happen again?? And also, have any of you had your jobs affected by it?"
dsf,"I think for me some of the major issues affecting my depression are happiness, motivation and isolation...I'm not really sure which came first, but I voted motivation, as I don't seem to have any! I can't remember the last time I truly felt 'happy' either - I think it was probably about 5 or 6 years ago when I was in college, had a great social life and thought I was with a great guy :-/ Socially, I find it very difficult to stay in touch with people because I'm paranoid that they don't really want to hear from me. I lost touch with friends when I moved to college, and then lost friends when I moved back to my home town. Now I have very few friends, and feel the ones I do have don't really care too much about me. I hate sounding like I'm feeling sorry for myself, but it's hard to explain..."
dsf,"I really wanted to go to the chat room today. but I'm at work and I don't think these computers allow it. I just really need someone to talk to. I am so sick of being this unsatisfied brat I just got a new job doing what i went to school for, and I hate it.  I feel like such a fake .. so pointless. i feel like no matter what i do it doesn't matter I am always going to be unhappy like the grass is always going to be greener where I am not.  I've taken personality tests and they say this is my personality. i don't want this personality. i want to be happy like other people.  well i say other people, but to be honest i don't know anyone that i would consider happy. everyone just seems to go on with life just kind of doing what they're supposed to i think happiness is a lie.  the only people i know that seem to be okay are alcoholics and druggies.  so you know they're not really ok. lately i've just been trying to fill the huge empty hole that my life is.  it's such a load of crap.  my husband says he loves life but he can't go one day without smoking stuff or drinking a 6 pack and i just want to scream at him LIAR.  and he tells to appreciate it because one day its going to end.  and you know what , i know he's right, but i find myself thinking that that would be such a weight off my shoulders no pain no worries no hassles no nothing. just over.  just done with all this stupid bullshit and the lies. somewhere i learned that life is supposed to be easy once you reach a certain point or succeed at certain things.  but that is so wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!! life will never be easy i will always be dealing with this crap and that makes me so sad and so wishing i were dead."
dsf,"I'm a hetero man, 35, divorced, no kids. I can honestly say that I feel empathy towards any guy who suffers from depression. Some of my closest guy friends have admitted to me their many bouts of battling these demons, just as I've shared my horror stories and near suicidal incidents, and we all have empathy with each other over that stuff. I'm beginning to not give a crap anymore about depression being viewed as just a ""woman"" issue; it is what it is and to heck with gender stereotypes. The things I've noticed the most are my friends' unwillingness to consult a therapist or take medication, but perhaps their bouts of depression are not the ""bed-ridden"" variety that I have gone through. Or maybe this is their way of not feeling ""completely weak"". Most of my friends will either drink excessively or take drugs to deal with this stuff. I tried to drink it all away, but in the end it just made me feel worse. I tried tranquilizers, but that didn't work. I tried booze and pills together, but still the depression lingered. Now I just smoke cigarettes and go running (what a dichotomy, I know) but whatever works, right? The only woman I've ever known who isn't empathetic or sympathetic to my depression is my mother."
dsf,"Hi all, I've just registered here... I've been depressed for quite a while, my dad died when I was 7 and my best friend died when we were 18. After the death of my father I was in counseling, but my counselor stopped coming to school to see me and I don't think I ever got anywhere from it. I'm currently 23, almost 24 (and male, from the UK for those keeping count) I've felt crap for ages... I hate my job, and doing that along with the stress of my final year of university sent me on a downward spiral. I would worry so much about my workload, but have no motivation to do it and get out of the situation. I hate being single, but can't find someone special who likes me, who I like back. I want to leave my job, but I can't afford to until I leave university and get a job doing something I want to. I had thought about suicide, but I know the pain of losing people close to me, and I couldn't inflict that pain on someone else. I considered cutting myself too. I thought that maybe if I was hurt, I could get extra time for university work, and maybe someone would help me. But I realized that I shouldn't do that, and should see someone about it. I also didn't have the balls to do it. I think bad thoughts a lot but I don't think I could go through with them. I was worried about going to the doctor though. My previous experience with a counselor has put me off them, and I don't like talking to strangers about my problems - that said I don't like telling people I know either because I feel that they will judge me. I was also concerned about medication because I don't know if I like the idea of chemicals altering my brain (apart from alcohol that is!) But about 3 weeks ago I finally went to see my doctor. He has put me on 20mg of Fluoxetine a day, although I'm not sure whether it is doing much. I've been having headaches and going a bit dizzy as well as getting sleepy (among other side effects). It's weird though, I don't know whether I'm feeling better or not, my friends say I seem different and better for taking it but I still feel bad at times... I still lie in bed at night worrying. But I think maybe I need to take it more and see how it effects me long term. I guess even on medication we all have good days and bad days. I was scared to tell my mother that I was on anti-depressants, as she works in mental health. Some would see this as a blessing as she understands the field to a great degree, but I was worried because I thought that she might think I was mad. I eventually got the courage to tell her after about 5 days though because I was very dizzy and I thought that she would suspect me of being on illegal drugs. She is being very supportive now, while still keeping enough distance that I don't feel like she's worrying too much about me. It's good to know that she understands that it's going to help me cope though... and she says its only a minor drug compared to what some of her patients take to stop the voices telling them to do things. Anyway I decided to look for somewhere online where other people know what it feels like, and I am glad that I've found this place. I hope I can make some new friends here, and maybe I can help a couple of people too."
dsf,"I'm a 23 yr old university student and I think I'm getting depressed again. One of the debates I'm having with myself is whether or not this is really depression. I was diagnosed with it about 2 years or so ago (although it wasn't my first bout of feeling low) and was put on a high dosage of medications (which I took). Things got better after a few months and so of course I stopped taking them cold turkey. Obviously not the best idea in the world, aside from this being one of the worst things to do because of the possibility of reoccurrence, my body went through heck and I had some pretty nasty side effects (even worse than when I was actually taking the meds).
Fortunately, it didn't reoccur and I've been feeling fine until the past couple of months. I think I'm feeling the warning signs again: low energy, crying, circular thinking, apathy towards everything, skipping school, sleeping all day, anxiety ...
I just feel like maybe this isn't really depression, maybe I'm just a person who doesn't handle stress well. Jeeze, when I read this it sounds so ridiculous. Part of me knows I'm being illogical but another part is just blaming me for being weak and not being able to just sit back and enjoy life. Why can't I just be happy? Why do I have to be so moody? Why am I so weak? It's stupid but I keep blaming myself. I don't think I'm bipolar since I've never experienced real highs but every couple of years or so my lows get really low. Last time was by far the worst and I wouldn't have been able to get through it without medications and I don't want it to get to that point again but ... I guess I still feel a lot of shame about it. It still feels like depression is being weak. I know, I know it's just like having diabetes and your body needs the chemicals to be normal but *sigh* I still blame myself. Last time I told my teachers and some friends and it's like they look at me as if I'm contagious or insane. I don't know if I can go through that again. But I don't know if I can keep on pretending everything is alright either ..."
dsf,"I'm new to this board. I've been on State Disability for severe depression since March. Sometime during the summer - can't remember exactly when - I was sent for a psychiatric evaluation. Even though I told the doctor I was still suicidal, sleeping 18 hours or not at all, bulimic, and in danger of eviction because I couldn't manage running a household, she determined I was well enough to go back to work. I have been under psychiatric care for depression for about 12 years now. This is NOT going away. I have been trying to finish my Social Security application since March but it's too overwhelming. I should have it ready this week. Does anyone have any experience with appeals at the state (California) level? Btw, I did lose my apartment and had to send my son to live in Texas with my mother since I was on the verge of homelessness. I spend all day paralyzed with fear. Help."
dsf,"I have such a strong urge to just pick my stuff and leave at the moment that it's not even funny. I really, really just want to grab a bus ticket and get out of here. I suppose there are a lot of reasons, but one in particular.

This is going to get a little creepy and it involves incest, so please don't read any further if you're just going to flame me. My brother has an attraction to me which really creeps me out. He's all the time running around the house naked, hitting on me, 'helping' me adjust my dresses so his hands can slide dangerously near my chest. It really, really disturbs me. My problem is that he asked me if it was all right if he hung around naked and stuff when I was drunk. I told him yes because I didn't have my mind about me. Now I can't think of how to tell him that it makes me uncomfortable and that I don't want him doing it anymore.

Along with that I just lost my best friend due to depression. I've been trapped in my house for two weeks and I haven't seen my mom, dad, brother, or sister for more than five minutes in this entire time.

I just want to run away from it all. I don't want to kill myself, but I do want to pack and go and just get away from this wretched town. Would it be such a bad thing to leave? I know it would be running from my problems, but maybe I could find easier problems to deal with somewhere else."
dsf,"i don't really  know what I'm doing here but i think i better get this out because it's driving me crazy and i really need to do something and stop thinking!

is it normal to be reaching out? i think that in the past looking back, i have tried to reach out and every time it just got screwed up. i feel stupid but i think it's like i need to know that someone knows that I'm in pain. is that rrlike normal?

the first time i wrote a letter to friends, school found it and called my guardian. i then was forced to a doctor who i lied to and ran away from as if nothing ever happened.
next it was an email, school found out, school counselor persuaded principal for her to deal with it. went to another doctor and ran away from it once more.
now I've left school, no school counselor anymore with shit still going on and me still not dealing well with it. since then i have spent so much money on credit where i started to message wrong numbers 'accidentally' - how lame is that?! i still talk to one lady that replied who also suffers depression. one night it went too far and i ended up being taken to hospital because of what i wrote ... and now I'm here.

do you think that this stupid reaching out will stop if i go to a doctor or counselor? is this what my problem is, that i need to know someone knows I'm in pain? why do i feel like this?

anyone?"
dsf,"I'm a single white gentleman, 27. I've dealt with depression since the age of 7, and it has gotten worse over the years. Not having any family / friends is not helping any (it's been this way for years now). My depression got really bad when I graduated from high school and my parents turned their backs on me. While everyone else was looking forward to a bright future, my parents had the attitude of ""screw you, you're on your own"". They refuse to help me in any way, which has caused unbelievable problems for me (unemployment being the biggest thing). Having a friend is not the cure - all, but it would definitely help a lot. I feel so hopeless and alone. I tried other internet groups, but found them to be nothing but a waste of time. Just looking for someone who can relate, and won't judge me. I am fully aware that this is not a dating site, but I would prefer to find a female friend. If anyone is interested and / or has any questions about me, feel free to contact me."
dsf,"it don't get no better than this Last night was a success. I was in truly rare form. My last non-fuzzy memory is of chugging beers at a friend's around 10:30, but highlights of the night include: making out with two of my girl friends; flashing one of my more reserved friends (reaction: ""Did she just flash me??""); waking up this morning with a stranger's cell phone on my desk (a peek through the phone book, and I was pretty sure he's not a law student), but thankfully no owner of the cell phone in my bed; doing way too many shots when, after being asked if I wanted to do shots, I responded, ""I really shouldn't do whiskey shots... Bring me the tequila!"" and apparently a solid effort at drunk dialing, if the outgoing call log on my cell is any indication. We had a really fun night, but then getting shitty with friends is always a good time. I think I was still drunk when I went to Civ Pro this morning, hmm. The bar we went to is dead on Thursday nights (though really packed on Friday and Saturday nights). It was nice, though -- we had the bar to ourselves. About 40 people showed up, and after talking to us for awhile, the owner said he'd give us drink specials on Thursday nights if we came back. He even comped a lot of our drinks, which was cool. We'll definitely be back. I liked this place already, but this is true incentive. A couple people are out tonight, but I lost my steam after Happy Hour. I just felt too exhausted to even think about going out. I made macaroni & cheese, sat on the couch, and watched TV. It's been a nice, quiet night."
dsf,I definitely think your right that my anxiety has sought out a fear that I dread more than any other and it is true that when I am not feeling depressed ( which incidentally is most of the time. This is only my second spell of depression in 39 years of life) I can mull over these thoughts and not be troubled with them in the slightest. It's really horrible how anxiety can feed off itself and lead you down this path to terrible thoughts. By the way when my partner was pregnant with our first child she to had dreams like yours and she was upset by them and she like you has turned out to be an attentive and first class mother.
dsf,"No doubt in my mind that since I have been taking Zoloft,  I do dream a  lot more and sometimes very vividly.  Most of mine don't make any sense either ... but on occasion, my remembered dreams are so real,  it's almost spooky.  (If only those dreams were somewhat romantic, well then I wouldn't be bringing this up, would I? ... lol)

Another thing I noticed is that if I'm asleep and my cell phone rings, I get up, walk a few feet away,  answer, carry a short conversation and afterwards, I have no recollection whatsoever.  It reminds me of sleep walking.  That is so unusual and strange to me.

You are not alone xxx :-)  and I am so glad you're feeling much better!"
dsf,"I'm 15 and have been depressed for about a year. i got over it for a little while but now i am back to all the pain. I cut myself for the first time a couple weeks ago and now i can't stop. I always reach for my knife when I'm alone and hurting.

One of my major problems is that I'm really good at hiding my feelings. No one knows that I'm depressed and no one except my best friend knew that i cut myself. I told my best friend because we tell each other everything when I told her the only thing she could say was ""you're Crazy"" Not exactly the reaction i was expecting especially since she once told me that she cut herself because we got into a huge fight. And even though I knew she was only saying it for attention and she had no scars on her wrist the next day, i still supported her. But now she is turning her back on me. I think she thinks I'm doing it for attention but I'm not. if i were i wouldn't hide the scars under my wrist band and long sleeve shirts. Any way so now i have no one there to talk to. I don't trust anyone anymore and I'm too scared to tell my parents. Even if i did they can't do anything. I have 3 other brothers and my parents don't have the time or money to deal with my problems.

I really scare myself. I have already planned out how I'm going to kill myself if i do and i tempt myself all the time i never have the guts to go through with it all the way but I still try.

I just really need some one to talk to. Someone who will understand where I'm coming from."
dsf,"I can't do it anymore, i am waiting for the right moment to do it i know that i will do it i just need to wait for the precise moment i think that it will be off in the distance but a part of me welcomes it at any given time the chance to rid myself of this turmoil this pain this disgusted feeling i have inside of myself... i actually have began to feel more emotional and it scares me because i don't want to be like that but i don't want to be a rock either i remember everything what have a i become a monster stares into my eyes reminding me that i am not who i think i am that life is not great for me that it doesn't matter what happens to me because i so will leave and a weight will be lifted from those around me and i am okay knowing that there will be things that i will never see things i will never know but i accept it..."
dsf,"Is anyone taking Lamictal?  After trying almost every available antidepressant through the years, my psychiatrist is having me try Lamictal.  (I'm 34, started taking medications when I was 18 -- haven't really taking anything for about five years, with the exception of Zoloft back in January, which had terrible side effects.) 

Right now I'm using the starter pack of Lamictal.  I took 25 mg for two weeks, and now I'm taking 50 mg for two weeks (I'm on my 17th day) -- working my way up to 200 mg.  I don't know if I really like this medication.  It gives me headaches and affects my sleep.  I think it also increases my anxiety, but maybe that's in my head?  I suppose the side effects aren't ""terrible"" but I still feel somewhat drugged.

Has anyone else had success with Lamictal?  I really don't like being on medication at all and can't believe I'm going to end up taking 200 mg when right now I'm only taking 50 mg and feel as if I'm ""on"" something."
dsf,"As expected, I lay awake for most of the night worrying about that bloody box! No such worries today though... £8,500... ""Deal""! That program really is terrific... must have been a real mastermind that thought it up... no doubt it was devised by one of those geniuses who is a member of Mencap. Anyway, you may be wondering how my trip to the shrink went this morning. Well, as ever, a bit of a disappointment (well I am here to moan you know!). Those of you who think that you lie down on a couch at the trick cyclists should dispel any illusions about reclining on a sumptuous Chesterfield sofa (unless you're going private). Not on the NHS I'm afraid. Mrs. Mo and I get to sit on wee NHS chairs around a coffee table. Well I say ""coffee"" table, as it is a small, low table covered with a brown Fablon veneer, but it has never held coffee on it as far as I am aware. The psychiatrist is a nice bloke though. We shall call him Dr Elton... not because he is profoundly superficial, childish and sulky, nor does he have an eternally patient partner called Mr. Furnish. No we shall call him Dr Elton because he bears a striking resemblance to Ben Elton... (even the gestures are spot on!) I always expect him to make a grand entrance in a sparkling diamante suit, holding a microphone and spouting swear words and political satire. However, he is usually markedly restrained. I still hang on the edge of my seat during the session, expecting some Freudo/Eltonian analysis ""Do you ever dream about showing Mrs. Thatch your fun sized Mars bar? you do, don't you, you snotty little shit"" but Dr Elton usually just asks me how my mood has been. Strangely enough, my GP is also a look alike, his double is Michael Portillo. Whatever complaint I presented to my old GP, whether it was an ingrown toenail or appendicitis, he would invariably respond ""Stop smoking and get back to the gym"". Dr Portillo however, responds to any complaint with ""Stop immigration and get back to Victorian values"". I also recently saw a psychologist who looked like Paul Robertson. But you probably won't know Paul unless you were in 3rd year in my school back in 1975. He sat behind me in physics... alopecia... furry pencil case... specs... no? never mind. (If you're reading this Paul.. hi!... sorry about calling you Kojak). Well that's enough about my celebrity medical staff. You're no doubt desperate to know how I got on at B&Q. Well, I hung around outside until the store was nice and quiet and then slunked (can i say slunked, as in slunk in?) in. I nearly went to the Customer Service desk but it was manned, as ever, by a very sad looking woman who looked as though she had just ran over a puppy and due to her guilt was avoiding eye contact with everyone. Not wishing to exacerbate her canicidal shame, I carried on to the kitchens department (she also looked like she would kill anyone who went within 3 feet of her and she was dangerously close to the power tools). The nice helpful lady in the Kitchens department was nowhere to be seen, so I reluctantly approached a uniformed youth who was gazing up at the ceiling in what appeared to be a catatonic state. I tested his waxy flexibility by arranging his limbs in a variety of postures and sure enough he remained motionless in whatever position I placed him. I explained my dilemma with the missing oven light and led him to a similar oven which was on display. I removed the light fittings and explained it would save a lot of hassle if I could just take these rather than order replacement parts. He raised an eyebrow at this point which I interpreted as ""That's an excellent idea sir, please take these and go home"". I pocketed the parts and left, after carefully positioning the salesman back where I had found him."
dsf,"I'm not exactly sure what the topic is (kind of vague), but for me: Depression started around the age of 11 (I'm almost 23 now), one summer I was sitting in my room, laying on my bed, listening to music, and gazing out the window, and it kind of hit me like a ton of bricks. I just felt like I didn't even exist.  Like the world outside my window didn't exist. Like the sun would never shine again.  Like life itself was pointless. I tried to talk to my mom about it, but she obviously didn't understand what I was saying to her, she told me I needed to do more work around the house to keep myself busy... look at me now..."
dsf,"i have been on celexa for a month now ... at first it was great ... i was dizzy and drowsy but my moods were much better i had a tolerance that i never had before ... the bad part was i couldn't eat ... i'm over that now! .. lol ... i do however have the oddest sleep patterns, i fall asleep everyday around 4 for an hour ... but can't seem to get to sleep at night ... i wake up tired .... as for the end of this month i feel normal .... or maybe i'm just used to it ... the one thing that bothers me is i'm normally a emotional person ... and i fear that i've become numb ... i don't feel things the way i used to ... which is i guess the point of it ... i've experienced weight loss however ..... i'm grateful for what it has done for me ... i am able to see my situation clearly and think about myself now."
dsf,"Hi everyone! I've been trying to find something or someone to help me out depression for ages, but I'm not an open person and it's been very difficult for me. I was never happy with my life and been just running away from problems. I left home when I was 18 and went to London. I wanted to start new life, but moved 11 times since then and always hoped I'll be happy in the new place. But it's getting worse and worse, I'm back home now, and start to realize, that I have nowhere to run and I'm getting old for that. I had a best friend in London, but she just used me and left when my ex went to jail. I have no one to talk to and I found so difficult to find new friends. I never talk about my problems, just to myself, when I'm with people, I'm completely different person, I'm so shy and I hate it. I hate it when I want to say something, but my mind doesn't let me and I'm just upset on myself. I don't remember the morning, when I woke up with a good mood or without headache. I've been thinking so much, that even when I stop I still feel this horrible pain in my head. I tried to bring my confidence up with drugs, but they just made it worse and I feel even more depressed. I've been thinking everyday. What am I going to do? and what is the worse about all this is that when I decide something what I feel is right and in few hours or minutes I think about it again and my feelings change and change again. ...it's driving me crazy. I'm getting so sensitive on everything, I'm crying from watching a stupid cartoon, or listening to the music, I feel sick or strange high on everything I put in my mouth. I think I've lost myself, I can't see the point of life anymore. Suicide? I tried that, but now I'm afraid of death, I'm afraid of everything. I would be glad if I could find some friends here... at least one, who understand and could beat this depressive moods with me. Love, Angela, 23"
dsf,"Could anyone help me.!  First my doctor gave me Wellbutrin SR ... well it made me too panicky .. This was 150 SR.  So then he gave me Wellbutrin XL at 150 mg.  This was doing well but not quite enough so he gave me 300 XL and I was so sleepy I could not handle it.  I don't know why it made me so sleepy but I only stayed on it a few days and then I went back to the doctor and he said ""ok let's go back to the SR pills but at 100 mg.  Well I'm still have those nervous feelings.  It's like I get hot, I get antsy and dizzy headed.  I'm guessing the SR is dispensed faster or something?  Could anyone please help me and tell me what has worked the best for them.  I would appreciate any help I could get."
dsf,"I'm 17 years old I live in the metro Detroit area and I have had depression for the past 5 years, my parents refuse to admit I have a problem, at one point I used to cut myself and at another point I was rushed to the ER to get my stomach pumped from trying to over dose. Basically I joined this forum so I can realize for myself I'm not the only one with problems. My depression has gotten a lot better over the years as certain situations got better too; I have a loving boyfriend whom I have been with for 14 months now, which I'm extremely sure that he has helped me. Next year, well in the fall I will be moving away to college, which I actually think will be a good thing for me. I am also a cheerleader at my school, which doesn't help with my depression I am constantly under pressure about that. I'm also a dancer, my parents have this thing where they like to find every little thing I do wrong. It seems as if nothing I do is good enough or right. Which has lead to my wanting to be alone and not eating. With the stress of dance and cheerleading and my parents constantly telling me I'm fat has lead me to only eat once or twice every other day. I know it is not healthy and I know it is not good, but I personally think its better then cutting and better then trying to overdose on pain killers and every other pill in the house. Thanks for listening."
dsf,"I'm 20 years old ..... things have been getting harder and harder lately ... i stopped cutting for 9 months .... but i fell apart and got back into it a few days ago .... i cut really bad tonight, and i feel like such a failure .... all i can do is sit here and cry .... the loneliness is really starting to get me ... i just need someone to talk to that understands ... i am seeing doctors and taking medications but they do nothing for me .... the momentary bliss from cutting is all i have since I'm a loner and can't get over my ex ..... if anyone out there understands or doesn't mind listening, please please let me know ...."
dsf,"Hello. I am just getting over a suicide attempt, my 2nd. It was extremely serious. I was planning it for week, and when I was fired form my job I did it the next day. I have a BS in chemistry and worked testing pharmacological products, so i knew what to take. I don't know what made me call my ex-BF. I did not speak to him for 4 months, but I wanted him to be the one to find me. Needless to say I lived. The doctors where surprised that I did. I took 3 things, (not going to give people ideas) that i knew they could not do anything for because of them being together. They could not pump my stomach cause of the one thing. They could not give any antidotes cause of interactions. I took well over the lethal limit. My life was spiraling out of control since Jan of 98. Since then, I have had 3 heart and 2 cancer operations. I was discharged from the Navy, was an officer, because of the medical stuff. My 1st suicide attempt was in the navy, they chalked it up to being stupid and not dealing with the 1st heart and cancer surgeries. My parents had a bitter divorce and I was caught in the middle when I got home. My mother assumed my ID and ran up a bunch of bills. I came out of the closet. I slept around to feel wanted. Which was not a wise choice, I gained my 3rd major medical situation. Not going to say what, but I am sure you can figure it out. I have a soul mate that I hurt, my ex-BF, and who knows if we will ever be friends or more. 2005 was a blur. I do not remember things, or saw things that where not there. Like documentation, which led to me being fired. I was afraid to leave the house, and was even afraid of 5 year olds selling candy for the school. The good thing about the suicide attempt is there was a proper diagnosis. I compartmentalized, and pushed emotions away. Every situation or moment had its own little box, and I put it away. I wanted to be like Spok or Data. I would put on different mask for different situations. There was shopping me, gas pumping me, heck, i had a separate mask for every action I performed. I have abandonment issues, from how i was treated growing up. Medicines did nothing and gave bad side effects. My depression is not chemical, but mental. I need to re-learn how to think and handle emotions and issues properly. Unemployment is running out, people are looking for money for bills. But it is better to be alive. WOW, this was longer than I intended. Just saying who I am, and I am a mess.....but slowly putting my life together."
dsf,"Hello, I'm Yevgenny, 21 years old, and have suffered from depression for...well...I guess as long as I can remember. I started having suicidal thoughts when I was 9, but strangely enough, I can't remember having at that age any concept of suicide. I've been placed on practically all of the antidepressants over the years (with the exception of MAOIs), and am currently taking Cymbalta--no real side effects, seems effective enough. My father died when I was 18, but that in itself wasn't so sad. Last September, I had a sudden thought regarding my feelings about his death, and I found the most heartbreaking aspect was, like I said, not the fact that he died, but that the process of dying was for him degrading and humiliating. Like me, he was very independent--if he needed help with something, he considered himself defeated; he was content in his own world, like I am, but the magnitude of something like death forced people into his world...those intangible connections between ourselves and others, between him and others, seemed to chain him down. When I had my last breakdown in September, I couldn't stop myself from imagining it; to find yourself suddenly and wholly dependent on others, and for them to force themselves into your mind, your world, and find for themselves some memory or happy relic to take with them such that even your most private, perhaps sacred thoughts and memories are wrenched from you. I thought about what it must've been like to know with certainty that death was all that was left, the helplessness of not being able to face your own future without someone either doing it for you or having earlier robbed you of the existential will power to do it. I attempted to hang myself after my morning classes. I'm not sure how, but before kicking the chair away, I forced myself to call someone because the world is so huge, and I've only had the chance to see such a small part of it, to die then, would've been so meaningless and empty--the very things I was attempting to escape, meaninglessness and emptiness. The friend I called left work immediately and came to me. She cried in one afternoon more than I ever have, and she wasn't even the depressed one. So, fast forward to today. Did some inpatient care. I'm seeing a therapist whom I trust, respect, and have thus far been unable to outwit (it's a good thing.) On a physiological basis, the medication is helping. Psychologically however, I've got some work to do. Ignoring biological/chemical factors, in order for me to be happy, I need to find/build/understand the meaning of my life. I do not believe that man is born with an inherent raison d'etre, or that one is given to him by some divine entity; rather, I believe that the meaning of one's life is self-constructed and in continual flux, it is something you work on, something you subsist upon, and yet is something that is always just out of reach, or one brush stroke undone. Not an easy job. But last week I was on my front porch at around 4pm having a cigarette (I'm keeping this habit for now.) Everything was still, the air still cold with winter but with traces of spring on every tree, the clouds were lit from below and the west, it was like a painting; but it was this oddly static scene that gave me the most lucid understanding of myself, that unstoppable, dynamic thing we call self. And so, more than ever before, I'm going to take treatment seriously and honestly; even if there is sadness, those chance moments of serenity that make up for in intensity what they lack in length, in those instances I think I will find meaning, no, I already have, I suppose. I apologize for how lengthy this became, but I'm guessing it was somehow necessary for me to say. I'm looking forward to talking with the other members of the forum, as I don't think I've ever talked to others who were depressed. Even if I don't find much help here, there might be someone who finds such help in me. Thanks! And, again, I'll try to keep future posts shorter, but in my defense, sometimes when I write I don't feel in control...oh, starting to go off again. Ok, I'm going to stop now."
dsf,"you know how everyone hates those family get togethers, at least I do. All my family is out of state And I rarely get the chance to ever see mine, but that's off point, I have severe depression and a terrible panic disorder, at my last doctor appointment we were discussing easter coming up and how hard it is for me to go to my in laws, especially since no one there will ever talk to me,(that's a whole other subject) anyway it was suggested to me that maybe we could invite the family over here for easter so that I would feel more secure. that way i could be busy with food and not feeling bad cause no one will speak to me. MY husband at the time when I spoke to him about it said that maybe it was a good idea, would be good for me. well today we had a bit of an argument over something i tried to do in here today, i just wanted him to try and understand what its like for me since he considers this a weakness not an illness, anyway, of course he went to his mothers, and accepted her offer for dinner and then came home and announced it to me, he didn't even bring up the possibility of maybe having it at our house. not even for me (also they have no idea about my illness , he is embarrassed i think) anyway, now I feel like he will never try to take my feelings into consideration.

I fell like throwing up
I feel like shit
I feel unloved"
dsf,"I really don't know what to do. I've suffered with depression for the past 6 years. It comes and goes with treatment. I thought i was over stuff but over the last little while it has got really bad again. I feel so low, so low and i can't pick myself up. I'm drifting away from everyone, they all enjoy going to the pub etc and i hate being with loads of people and i don't drink so i don't go out. They have given up on me now. I hate my job. That brings me down so much. I work for the ambulance service taking 99 calls and i can't deal with the pain and suffering of everyone anymore. A 15 year old girl died the other day whilst i was on the phone and it's just not fair. I just can't deal with stuff anymore. I feel alone, i am dull and boring, in debt and i just cant see the point anymore. The only thing keeping me afloat, and i really feel like I'm hanging on by the skin of my teeth is my boyfriend he is the only thing i live for and he is bound to dump me. It's like a vicious circle. I'm incredibly insecure and he will get fed of it and dump me. If he dumps me that will be it there will be nothing. I think about it all the time. I want time off so i can just be on my own but I'm screwing up my chance of finding another job so i can get away from this one. I don't know what to do. I am seriously thinking about ending it all and i don't know how to pick myself up."
dsf,"I'm sitting here at what is my 26th or 27th job (I can barely keep count. I'm 27 years old by the way). I already hate it and I've been here one month today. I don't think it's normal to have this many jobs over a lifetime, let alone when you're just in your late 20's. I've applied for disability before but was denied. I don't dispute the fact that I can get a job, I just can't keep a job. I get bored, I get anxiety attacks, I get to the point where I don't want to go outside at all. I'll never be able to work (successfully) with all those things going on. When I went to see an attorney to appeal my disability decision, he said I should find a job with minimal responsibility. What kind of job is that? Don't you have to be responsible enough to at least come to work (and on time)? Don't you have to be responsible to follow the rules of the job? I can't seem to do either one. Each job I get, I think ""maybe this can be the job I can stay at"" and it never happens. The longest I've ever stayed at a job is 1 year. I just feel like such a loser. Everyone I know always says they'll do whatever kind of job for their kids, or I should be lucky to have a job. I can see their point, but when I feel so miserable I can't see past that. I drag myself to jobs only to end up quitting or getting myself fired. What's wrong with me? Any advice? Anyone?"
dsf,"I don't know what good being here will do but I NEED someone to talk to. I am so depressed that I am actually crying while I am typing this. I am a single mother of three (one lives with me). I have no job. I have a tremendous amount of clerical skills and am currently in college but I feel like the world is crashing down around me. I have been on Prozac since 1986 because of the loss of both my parents. I have no one to talk to, no friends, no family. I have no one to turn to. I up and left my last job because of a fight between my boss and I. If I get into conflict when I am depressed I run away from things. Now I can not get a job because when they call the job for references, they slam me. I get no child support for my son because if I go to file they will make me pay (I have no income at all except for money that I am able to borrow) my ex because he has two of my kids. (He makes a tremendous amount of money but won't even give me lunch money for our youngest son). I am at the bottom of the tunnel (been here for some time now) and can not see the light. I have been trying and trying to get a job but the door keeps being slammed in my face. I feel like crap and can't cope with it any more."
dsf,"For some reason ...
I am never happy anymore ...
It all started a little less than a year ago.
Suicide attempts, cutting, burning, hair pulling, slapping, basically just wanting to die.
People tell me my life isn't that bad just because my family has money.
Money isn't everything.
Also, everyone spreads rumors about me, and tells me crap to my face!!!
My boyfriend is really sweet and I LOVE him, but he has a serious anger issue!
His psychologist diagnosed him with an anger issue.
And lately when he gets frustrated, he sometimes hits me.
Not like REALLY hard, but hard enough to leave a mark.
Then later he doesn't remember doing it.
I'm worried about him, and myself.
I don't want our relationship to end because of our problems.
And none of my friends understand why I cut and stuff.
It's not always for attention you know!!!
So, if someone could please email me at xxx.
Or reply.
That would be great.
Please talk to me"
dsf,"Hello again everyone, my real name is Mike. I found this site a couple weeks ago but have been pretty busy with the holidays and a new job. So I thought I would post a bit more about myself. This isn't easy since I am not that good at talking about myself but here goes. I am 35 years old and have been depressed as long as I can remember. When I was 12 or 13 years old I remember sitting in my closet in my room with the doors shut writing a suicide note. After talking to a friend of mine about 7 years ago who started going to a therapist and taking Prozac, I decided to go get help. I didn't even know to call it depression until I started talking to him. I was diagnosed with Dysthymic Disorder and have been on and off a couple different kinds of medicines, one of which was Effexor and the other one I can't remember the name but it started with and S. I have a bad habit of remembering every bad thing that has ever happened to me and continually go over and over it in my head. I will bring up something with my brother or sister and they say ""I can't believe you remember that"" and yet sometimes I am lucky I remember my own name. I just started a new job recently and will not have insurance until the end of January. I am seriously considering going back to a therapist and possibly getting on medicines again. I am tired of carrying around this baggage and want to do something about it. There are so many things I want to do with my life and seem held back by my depression. I found this site one night after feeling really depressed over something that I can't even remember now in the hope talking to people who knew how I felt and what I was going through."
dsf,"i am a 16 year old. i think i am depressed, but i don't know how to tell. um...it is like i am afraid to tell my parents because i know them, they will brush it off as no big deal or make me sit down and tell them what is going on. Did they ever think that i don't want to talk to them? My mother is like a roller coaster ride you cannot wait to get off of. One day she could care less that i am sick, or that i need to tell her something, and then the next day she is all, talk to me, tell me what is going on. God it can be so annoying. i know that i have a problem with my emotions, i just can't seem to control them, when i am upset, stressed, angry, sad. There are always three things that i do. First i cry, then i scream, then i run to my room, and sometimes i might knock something down. And that gets me another, what is going on talk. Two years ago my grandma died. We weren't that close and i think that is part of my problem. every time i try to go to sleep i just lay there and think about my life, and realize, there isn't that one person, you know, everyone has one, that one person that you can just call up and say, ""hey, i am in a bad mood, can you talk..."" or ""hey i just got in another stupid fight with my mom, do you have time to talk to me..."" and maybe that is what is wrong with me, i don't have someone to vent to so i keep it all inside. i mean i try and find ways to let my anger and frustration out like, i am a poet, sort of. Everyone tells me i am at least, but what they don't seem to understand is that maybe i am a good poet because i have nowhere else to let all of this out. No one can see that, no one can see that i need someone to talk to. i try and talk to my mom, but she is so busy, and that is not her fault, it isn't like she is ignoring me on purpose, she has school, she has work, she has my brother's wrestling match, she has a meeting. then i try and talk to my friends, and i know that they would listen and they would try and understand, but i don't know, i just don't feel as though they need all of my crap on their shoulders, not that you do either, who ever is still reading this. i guess it is that sometimes, i feel ignored. i turned sixteen this year. Happy Sweet Sixteen...right? i wanted to have a party, i wanted to go out and have a good time. But that didn't exactly work out the way i had planned. At first i thought that my friends had forgotten about me, no call on my birthday, no card. And then they threw me a surprise party, nothing big and fancy, just small, just the four of us, the way we like it, but still it felt weird, it just didn't feel right. i am supposed to be driving, i have my temporary permit, i have had them since October, you know how much i have driven, about one hour. i could have gotten my license last month, but i cannot go to driving school until i get more experience, and i can't get more experience until one of my parents decides to let me drive. They used to take my brother out all the time, they would let him drive everywhere. i don't know, i just feel like sometimes being the middle child and the only girl i get ignored. i am a cutter. i tried to tell my parents three times that i was a cutter and i wanted to stop. i couldn't tell them in words so i wrote them a letter, they never read it. you probably think i am some selfish person, but i just have been holding all of this inside of me for three months now and there is more down inside of me, i just need to slowly let it out. Sorry if this took up to much of your time. Thank you for listening to me...it feels nice to know that maybe there is someone out there listening."
dsf,"I just wrote a really long entry, but because the school computer can't seem to handle using the whole categories thing on WordPress, I'm having to start over. Today is my final day of school for this semester.  I have one more ""exam"" to go. It's in Advanced Comp.  We get to write persuasive essays.  I'm really good at those, so I'm not really worried.  I had my Art of Interviewing test today, and I'm worried about the matching section of the test.  I got a bit confused on it.  It was easy stuff, but my little brain just couldn't seem to process it. I wrote another long entry a week or so ago, but I lost it too.  In it, I ranted about a ""friend"" of mine. I don't like her, but she thinks we're really close.  She uses me and expects me to do things for her.  She presumes that I can just do whatever she wants for some reason that it unbeknownst to me.  I'm just sick of doing things with her and for her.  I want to tell her to just go away, but she probably wouldn't listen.  I made it perfectly clear that being touched pisses me off, and what does she do?  She touches me.  I just want to, at the very least, slap her.  I don't get why she has to touch me.  What on earth does she gain by touching me?  Maybe she's just forgetful, but why does she forget that, but she doesn't forget that I can type really fast? It's supposed to be stormy today, which I hate.  As I have stated many times before, I don't like stormy weather.  Hell, I'm afraid of stormy weather.  I like to be in my house where I feel more safe. I really don't feel safe at A&M since it seems to be a target for severe weather. I need to waste another twenty minutes before I leave to go to my final exam. I guess I can just keep typing, can't I? I mean, I have several weeks worth of crap that I can talk about.  Actually, I don't really have that much to say. I've worked on family history stuff, which is pretty neat.  I know that that's dorky to say, but it is nice to know where my family comes from.  I had a friend once who said that only Americans seem to care about their heritage, but I don't think that that's true.  If other cultures didn't care about their heritage, then they wouldn't keep information about it.  It would just be dust in the wind. I've replaced my Hayden Christensen obsession with an obsession on Eric Balfour.  He's Brian on Conviction and played Gabe on Six Feet Under, as well as Jesse (Xander's friend in the first episode) on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  (He was also in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.)  I've gotten his band's CD (Fredalba's Uptown Music for Downtown Kids).  I've also bought a movie he was in (Lie with Me).  Both are pretty good.  The movie definitely isn't for younger audiences. I no longer have Gulshan as my therapist. I wasn't going to have her anymore because I have Medicare. I was going to leave her yesterday. I'm just sick of her. I tried to leave once before and she asked for a second chance. I gave her a second chance, and yesterday, she said that that never happened. Why would I lie about that? She asked for another chance yesterday before she realized that the Medicare would keep her from being my therapist anyway. I now have an LCSW for a therapist. That should be interesting. I should probably go. I hope that I actually get this entry to show up."
dsf,"I'm 29, female and i live in the UK. My background with depression is that i started suffering from it significantly when i was 18 and
have been on various antidepressants since. I've recently come off
Effexor (venlafaxine) after about 5 years of being on it, at mostly
the 150 mg dose, and this has been the only antidepressant that's
properly helped me. Two months ago i decided to come off it, as id
been wanting to at least lower the dose i was taking, for some time.
Also my doctors surgery are now ""funnier"" about prescribing it to
new patients because of the reports of heart murmurs among some
patients. I've been taking citalopram, at either 20 mg or 40 mg but i
don't really like these medications and after this month is up I'm hoping to
come off them, either to go on something else or to stop taking antidepressants altogether, those are my options. But the truth
is ..... and my doctor is wondering as well .... what medications would i go on
next? I've felt pretty rotten lately and the citalopram has done
little for me except negative stuff, it makes me want to just take
the venlafaxine again!

Any thoughts, comments or suggestions would be most welcome!!"
dsf,I have dealt with depression since I was about 12 years old and am now 26. I can tell that it is getting worse again and feel as if I am losing the battle. I feel as if I have no where to turn. My medication is not working the best and I am at the max dosage. I do not want to start over with another med and all the side effects. I am hoping that it will get better soon. I do the best I can. I have a husband and 2 children. My husband tries but does not really understand depression. We have talked about it some but does not seem to help much. I was hoping someone might have some advice for me.
dsf,"I have really been trying to 'control' my rage while driving. Since being medicated it's not as bad, but I can't stop. Today this guy chased me, forced me to pull over and started yelling, I thought he would hit me. I was surprisingly calm, not even afraid. I guess I just didn't care what happened to me at that point I hate when I get so angry, go into road rage mode, because I feel like crap afterwards, I don't like myself, I usually cry. I can't talk to my husband especially about this. I feel very isolated. All he does is get mad, lecture me, tell me to stop, don't you know it's dangerous, etc. He judges and blames me. He has no idea how I feel and I doubt he ever will. I feel better now that I can come here and talk to people who will understand my feelings (even if what I did is wrong, I hope???). It's very easy to say you'll change, you'll calm down. Easier said than done. I feel like I have to hide the fact that I'm in this forum from my husband, I have to hide a lot from him. I just hope that raving lunatic doesn't come after me if he finds out where I live. I have talked to my therapist about this but not in any depth, I only get 45 minutes of her time per session. I'd need hours. Thanks for listening, I feel a little better"
dsf,"I know life isn't easy but I never knew it would be this hard... :( I feel empty and numb, but at the same time so sad and hurt... My biggest struggle is with my family, the only person that is there for me is my Step Dad... No one else seems to get it? My mum is always telling me to not keep secrets and that I should tell her how I feel coz if she doesn't know everything how can she help me? But I don't want to have to tell her everything (Because she says hurtful things back at me once I tell her and she won't even hug me) but if I don't tell her she makes me feel so bad and so I do tell her how I feel and then she shoots me down! She tells me to snap out of it and just get on with it and to stop being so stupid... every time I talk to my mum I cry coz she hurts me so much! And then she gets all down coz she makes me down which makes me down!!! I JUST CAN'T WIN! These days I only have to say something like ""oh that sucks, no milk"" and she tells me to get over it or get lost! And all I did was say something. I can't even really explain it? It's like she won't be happy until she hears what she wants to hear... I have tried talking to her about the way she makes me feel and all I get is ""that's just life"" or she starts telling me how she buys me things and that I should feel like this coz she has brought me things and let me use her car, etc, etc... The other day I was haven a really bad day and I asked mum for a hug and all she could say is ""No..."" she says she doesn't want to feed my sadness BUT instead of doing happy things she just tells me to get over it! And she won't listen when I say stop...She even told me to pack my bags and leave once if I didn't get over whatever it was I was going through! If I didn't have my step dad I wouldn't be here today... I love him more than the world and he is the only one that shows me that he loves me... I just need help... I don't want to be like this but then there are days when I love to feel sad and hurt."
dsf,"Poor Spring. He tries so hard but sometimes things don't work despite best laid plans. His ex wife is doing 'something' almost every weekend in August and September. So his plan to take me away have dissolved. Thing is... I kind of think it's a tad bit of not wanting to see him happy. Ex's are so hard to deal with. Look at me and Cretin. He still continues to make our lives a misery on every given occasion. Wait until he finds out I have a boyfriend. It'll be 50 questions as to who he is, his family heritage and down to whether we have depraved sexual practices in front of the girls. I also really detest his girlfriend... Mainly because of the times she's upset the kids. It's not the kids fault. I feel like Small Spring is caught in the middle a little bit and won't have him made to feel bad in any way. So we aren't going away in the way we'd planned.... We're trying to snatch a night in July maybe? We'll see, no pressure. It's meant to be fun not a trial. There's always the turkey and tinsel fun weekends at Christmas. I can wear tinsel in strategic places and feel MUCH more relaxed ;) I feel good tonight. I like being able to take control and understand stuff. Rise above the crap. Oh cat worries..... Taylor has a limp. He's ALWAYS got something going on. Probably fighting with the neighbors with the 6 England flags (still up) scabby cats. Bailey has brought in yet another huge Moth. I am the moth rescuer in this place. Plus I'm longing for a new kitten."

Sometimes I feel like we all would be better off with me out of the picture ... whatever that takes .... because I am sick of the guilt !!! I also am suffering from 4 herniated discs in my back with sciatica down both legs. So doing things just suck. My husband made the comment today that we should sign me up for AARP ... at least we could get some good benefits. I'm 35. Plus these medications make me feel like shit!

Problems: I don't have a cent to my name, parents will not give their ok on the issue and I haven't had a job in over a year and there are no prospects in the near future. I could go behind their backs and apply for a loan but I would just feel a lot better knowing they were ok with it all, I don't want money from them. Some meaningless minimum wage job is not going to make me feel good, if anything it will make me feel worse about myself. I have not accomplished a single thing in my life and feel this is pretty much the last straw to do something meaningful, but day after day there is another block and I have no means of getting around it, I'm 100% dependant on my parents (who are usually the blocks) and I hate it. This isn't something I want, its something I need.."
dsf,"I'm having a problem with my depression. You see, I'm taking more medicine. I'm taking Welbrutrin (150mg) on top of my Zoloft (100mg). I've been out of work for over 5 months. And it is now SERIOUSLY making me crazy. I need to talk with people, but I don't know how. I need to find a job, but I don't know how. I am a good guy. In fact I am THE good guy. All of the people who have had me to work for them have loved me. I get promotions all of the time. It's getting in the door that seems to be the problems. And I have a family to take care of. My wife started working, but it won't be enough to pay the rent. This is so hard for me. I am of the old school. I believe in chivalry, the man taking care of his family. Except that I feel like I'm being less of a man. I am broken. I don't know what to do. I can see myself being suicidal, but not in the sense of killing myself, but for looking for someone to help me. God I've never been in such trouble. And I don't feel loved. It's not my wife, it's not my son. But I think that not working for so long, and the fact that I don't have friends, makes me need contact with people. Any people. I just don't know how to do that."
dsf,"When I was 10, my babysitter molested me many times over the course of 1 year. Many of the times she would make me dress up in girl's clothes and she would take me out that way. I'm 30 now. I still can't have sex. I still can't go out into public without having severe anxiety attacks. And when I'm at home, I find myself cross dressing sometimes.
The shrinks with whom I've spoken have never been helpful so I'm hoping this post finds someone who may have some idea of what I went through and am going through now.
Please write if you have any ideas to share."
dsf,"Hi, this is my first time posting a reply to something (besides the welcome new member forum). I feel uncomfortable replying to someone else when I don't feel like I have anything helpful to say, but I really need to get some stuff out, so I'll start here. I am staying at my parents' house right now for winter break (I am in college). I really wanted to come home but now that I'm here I think it was stupid of me to want to come home. Being at home with no one but my parents to talk to only fuels my depression. My dad is the worst. I feel like he's always judging me, and I'm a disappointment to him. I feel lazy and immature. I only have a few friends left here in my hometown, and I barely talk to them. The friend who I am closest to got a new boyfriend about a week ago, so she won't want to just hang out with me so much. And I understand that. The friends I am not so close to anymre, it is awkward talking to them. it always just goes back to high-school. So I am stuck home all day and I don't feel like doing anything but watching TV and sleeping. I feel awful. There is so much more that I could say but I'll leave it for another post."
dsf,"I'm new and my message doesn't seem to fit anywhere else. I have been suffering from depression since I was 15 (now 21) but I've only recently thought of it as 'depression' as I used to think it was just me and all my feelings were real. It started with wanting to end up in hospital - get hit by a car etc. I felt useless and boring and unwanted by my family or anyone. Felt like I was jus in the way wherever I went. I felt empty and the only escape I ever had was fantasizing about the day I die - that release that I would feel from everything. So I used to write suicide notes and when I could read them without crying then I would deem myself ready. Or I would think that if I could starve myself for a week then I would be ready. (This one I couldn't do) finally it all got too much. In my head, my parents were so disappointed in me that they would be better off without me and to my sisters I was too annoying that they wouldn't miss me. Up until now I had jus cut myself discreetly. So I took 80 paracetamol (not knowing then that they can't actually kill you) and jus sat around waiting - half excited half scared. Nothing happened for ages and I started to get more scared - what would my parents think? Would they cope? Would they blame themselves? So I threw up and called an ambulance myself. I will never get over how hurt they were by what I had done and so will never do that again. But I still think bout it. When ever things get too hard. I think how can I make it look like an accident as I know they could handle that much better than suicide. I have been on antidepressants for 8 months now. For the 3rd time. But it seems that they are just putting a 'blanket' over how I'm feeling and I'm not addressing the real issues; not that I know what they are. I can't get motivated to study, go to class, go out, anything. I don't care. I don't see the point in living a miserable life and what if there is no point? what if our worlds are all the creation of our minds and once our minds are dead, so is our world so there's no one left hurting once were gone? What is the point to a miserable life when it could all be ended now? I don't think suicide is the right way to go - I believe only god, whatever you conceive him to be (if anything) should have the only power over life and death, but why does he take some people and not others? (More specifically, me?) I pray that he will take me next - give me the cancer meant for someone who loves life - but as yet has been to no avail. But if all we are to do is to be alive then die, why can I not decide to take my death into my own hands, like so many people do what they want with their lives? Of course, there's always the factor of limbo - do people who commit suicide really end up in limbo? I suppose what scares me even more is that - going through the pain and anguish of suicide just to end up in limbo - with just your mind, thinking away for ever.... are my feelings wrong? Is it a chemical reaction in my brain? Or do I just not belong in this life? So confused! And just don't see the point in being here - anyone have the answers I'm looking for? Life is pointless."
dsf,"I've been having a difficult time lately. In addition to my mental state of disarray, I have a medical condition that can affect my mood. My medication has changed lately; my body hasn't caught up the difference yet. The last few days have been particularly bad, especially at night. The familiar sensation lurks again on my upper leg. Scissors. Half-dozen lines -- my usual, though in the past I would sometimes keep cutting until my self-hatred was momentarily spent. Pressure on the blade to force the skin to gape slightly and bleed more. I am not proud. I knew it wasn't the best way to cope. I did at least take the precautions of using a sharp blade, knowing that a jagged blade could leave a jagged wound, and of lavish aftercare. I washed it out with rubbing alcohol, which causes renewed bleeding but was necessary to keep everything clean and infection-free. Covered everything with a jumbo Band-Aid, the kind kids put on skinned knees, and haven't dared to look since. Afterward, I was afraid that I was back to my old ways. I told myself in near-hysterics that this was strictly a one-time backslide. The surprising part is that I believed myself. This does not make me a cutter again. This does not mean that I have lost everything that I've gained. All it means is that I have been having an extraordinarily bad time and resorted to extraordinary behavior in order to cope. My situation will improve. My body chemistry will even out. It's better not to cut, but I am not a bad person even if I do cut. The words are stupidly simple. I don't care. They are my magic that keeps me going."
dsf,"Hi all... this is going to be a long post, but I'd really like some feedback on it... I'm kind of young, 17. I'm currently involved in a relationship (long distance) with a boy who's a year older than me, and I love him more than words can say. The thing is, though, I'm a very depressed person sometimes.  I don't know if I'm making this up or if I actually read this somewhere, but I'm what I've heard classified as a ""seasonally"" depressed person: I experience depression more during the winter months (December through February) than I do any other time of the year. I have a lot of family problems that compound to my depression as well. When I was 13, I moved halfway across the country and I never accepted living here. I'm a city-girl, but I moved to the country. I feel isolated and alone out here, and I don't have anyone to talk to. My mother told me to ""buck up"" and ""get over it"" when I went to her about my depression a couple of years ago. She's currently on medication for her own depression. My father has a crippled arm (which he gained when we moved here) and has some addiction problems, so I don't go to him.  I have a very hard time trusting people. My mother and father were both abused as children, and my mother verbally abuses me. Recently, starting in about December, I started wanting to hurt myself physically again. The urge faded, but the depression lingered. For a while I've been emulating my mother on my boyfriend--I keep taking out my own anger and my own depression on him. I'm afraid that if I keep up with this behavior, I'm going to lose my boyfriend to my own selfishness. A lot of the time I wish I could disappear. I don't like being seen by people and I like to be alone, but at the same time I feel isolated in my soul. I tried religion, but I can't bring myself to place my faith in something I can't see. I'm really afraid that my depression is going to cause me to lose the one thing I even care about at all anymore in the world. I don't know what to do. My parents won't help me, my teachers don't know how to deal with it, and I've been to depression forums like this before and they really helped. I guess all I'm looking for is someone to lean on while I get through the winter months. If anyone has any suggestions for a homebody (my parents don't allow me to leave the house after school is over), please let me know. Also keep in mind that I can't call people very easily with eavesdropping people in my house. Thanks. Sarina"
dsf,"When I was 16 I was raped by my boyfriend. I was a virgin at the time and it was really hard to accept that this had happened to me. I thought that somehow if I didn't say anything to anyone or raise a fuss about it it wasn't true. But it only made it worse. When I tried to break up with him he tried to kill me. We worked together and that made it really difficult to avoid him. He told all his friends at work that I had ""given it up to him"" which wasn't true. I was mocked and teased by the people that i felt had grown to be my family. 

Now, five years later it is still something that hangs tightly in my mind and heart. It is very hard for me to trust anyone and good relationships have been few. I still look over my shoulder thinking he is going to be there again, following me, stalking me, preying on me."
dsf,"I have just now realized now, after 24+ years of experiencing it, that what I've suffered from is depression. Soon after that, I spoke to my dad about it, and learned he'd been on AD's for over 10 years now, and he said he probably could have used them from the time he was about 15 years old on. He also said my paternal grandmother's side of the family was all just like us (my dad and I are almost carbon copies of each other, except he's always seemed much more ""perfect"" to me than I am.  ) He also said my oldest half brother is also on AD's. I also talked to my oldest daughter (who's 21 year-old), and she said she's been on AD's a few times too. I can say also that I learned many years after his death that my maternal grandfather experienced severe depression before I was born. He had shock therapy multiple times it seems...but I don't know if his problems were entirely from the extreme horrors he experienced in WWII, or a combination of that plus other problems. When I knew him he was always a sweet loving, rather quiet, man (and my favorite person in the world other than my dad.) My dad said he never associated my problems with depression (of course, neither did I), but now it all clicks. I wish I'd known all this when I was younger, that depression hadn't had the stigma it had back in the 1970s & 80s, and that I could have gotten treatment back then. Of course, if I had, I wouldn't have the same life I have now, so I guess I can't complain about that (and honestly wouldn't change a thing...I wouldn't risk losing my kids or what I've accomplished, no matter how crooked and difficult the path as been). But I will definitely watch my young kids now for signs of depression (especially my 4 year-old daughter, since she seems to have a similar personality to my dad and I). If I see it, they will get the treatment they need immediately! So in that sense I think this is a blessing...knowledge is power."
dsf,I'm 16 years old. I am having problems in school and I feel like dropping out. I also feel like committing suicide. I have foster parents and I don't like them one bit. I cry every night because I miss my mom. At this point in life I don't feel a need in living. I really need your help and advice to make me feel more comfortable talking to my foster parents and to convince me not to kill myself. I am a very suicidal person who is looking for help. I have a record of cutting myself and burning myself so i think that the cutting and burning led to suicidal attempts I am looking for help. i don't know what led suicide but if anyone has any advice on what i could do or any questions please tell me
dsf,"I feel like holding in my anger.... or at least trying to be NICE all the time contributes to me feeling depressed. Maybe it's a good thing you're experiencing anger, maybe you deserve to express those ""negative"" emotions, of course without hurting anyone.... I wonder how much my not feeling worthy or feeling powerless contributes to not speaking up & holding in angry feelings and in a vicious cycle my depression will feed off feeling powerless or undeserving and create even more feelings of worthlessness.... VICIOUS CYCLE!!!! Because, feel like I don't have very good boundaries & am not nearly assertive enough when I need to tell people what I NEED & what I WANT... then my resentment & anger build up... I have definite triggers that make me so angry (especially my husband) I wish I could beat the s*** out of him.... under it I'm just so F***ing HURT!!!! And if I can get in touch with the hurt I can express it some how... cry, write, something..... And of course he can hear me better when I am sharing my ""being hurti vs. Screaming & throwing things..."
dsf,"Oh my god.  I am THE most irritating person to be with recently.  It's just cry cry  cry.  Silly little things start me off then it just goes into the big list of reasons as to why  deep down I hate myself.  Then it goes into, you are ungrateful so ungrateful and a wimp a big stupid wimp an ungrateful selfish attention seeking wimp (go into the happy place go into the happy place, the nice view - wouldn't it be easy to jump from this nice view - find another happy place - stuff the happy place grab your teddy and go to sleep) you don't deserve to be alive you don't deserve this great boyfriend when all you do is pick petty little arguments and cry all the time at silly things (go to sleep you're tiring yourself out).  Then when i'm tired out i'll stop crying, then a few minutes later i'll sob then i'll get tired from that too and i'll brainwash myself with rubbish television.

rrgrrrrrrr i cant stand this.  this is slushy moany person i hate.  i'm turning into someone i hate.  i have been for ages.  i'm losing control.  i'm losing control.  ""it's not the end of the world they say"" well mine's crumbling away and it's all my fault and every time i get back into putting things right something knocks me down and every time things seem ok BANG! there it goes again streams of tears spurted from absolutely nothing.  what a blooming fool!

excuse all this craziness this has been my 1st really bad spell since i joined this site about a month ago just as my last one was becoming ok."
dsf,"I was just curious what your feelings are on long-term outcomes for depression. A little background for me: I've been on and off medicines for several years. I was always depressed as a child, but didn't really seek professional help until maybe 10 years ago. I originally went on medicines. for severe pms prescribed to me by my ob-gyn. I just kind of continued on with it because it made me feel ""leveled out"". Then I had issues with sleep apnea, joint pains etc. My neurologist put me on Effexor. Every time I tried to go off that drug I was dizzy and had bad side effects. Finally, I reduced the dose myself and weaned myself off the Effexor. I had gained a tremendous amount of weight. I was off all medicines for 8 months and then I really feel into a dark depression. It was then that I sought a therapist, etc. I have been on medicines ever since...since June of 2004. I had lost 40 pounds by going off the medicines, but then became depressed again. following several deaths and major life events. I was put on Lexapro and gained weight. Not wanting to gain weight again, I hated being on the medicines. He kept saying it will stabilize. I told him that the weight gain was making me more depressed. Finally, he changed my medicines to Wellbutrin. We talked about trying to go off medicines when life events settled down...my main reason to go off was the weight gain. Immediately the weight came back off. That was a year ago. Now a year later, I am still losing about a pound or two a month. The last time I went in, he didn't say anything about going off the medicines. How long do people take medicines? Is it just better to stay on them and not fall back into the hole? Are there any long-term use side effects to be concerned with? Is this something I will probably be on forever? It just seems like I will always be like this. It just seems like depression is always just standing back in the shadows. I go for a very long time and feel fine and then I have a week where I get very down and know that if I wasn't on medicines. it would be very bad. I haven't gone to talk to my therapist in a long while. When I am having these bouts of depression, should I call and say I need to go in for a ""check-up"". I don't really have any specific issues to discuss. The big thing right now is I just feel down because I have lost my closest friends and don't feel like I have any friends to do anything with. I feel so isolated. Would it be good to just call and go in? I just feel stupid saying I feel sad because I don't have any friends. Are there any good books that you can recommend on self-help--esp. negative thinking, understanding why I think the way I do, etc. I found Dr. Phil's book on Life Strategies to be very helpful in discovering that there are reasons why I do things and think."
dsf,"I am a 31 year old mom of 5. I have a 25 year history of anxiety, depression and OCD. I have spent years of my life trying antidepressant drugs and anti anxiety medications to help with the symptoms but I have been labeled treatment resistant. I either have side effects that I can't tolerate off of the drugs or they just don't work for me.

I walk around every single day either feeling lifeless, numb, helpless, angry or detached from my family. I have no support from my family as I am estranged from my abusive parents and my sisters are not interested in my emotional problems. To make matters worse I suffer from seizures, migraines and asthma which cause me to be prone to bronchitis and pneumonia. I spend a lot of time sick and in pain.

I have five kids to raise. Two of them are disabled. They have severe speech disorders that make them behave in a negative way. It makes me feel frustrated. My oldest daughter has problems in school because she is having problems with her vision. She may have dyslexia.

I never get out of the house except to go to Walmart or the grocery store. I can't drive because of my seizures and my husband never keeps a consistent schedule. I am housebound and lonely. I see a therapist when I can and he has actually told me he is amazed I haven't killed myself by now with the stress I am under. I am burnt out and sinking fast. Does anyone have any good advice for me?

I do not have a support network so forget about that. I can't make it to support groups so that is out. I am alone except for my children and my computer addicted husband. Please help me figure out how to cope with my life. Right now I am dealing with my new seizure medication and the ongoing problem I am having with hair loss for no apparent reason. I am very depressed about it.

Any advice is appreciated. Please don't take this as me whining about my life. I really am not. I am just trying to figure out where my place is in all of this confusion."
dsf,"I'm new to this forum and actually to the whole talking to people I don't know online thing.  I've been looking around a lot online to find somewhere I can talk, but all the chat rooms and forums say they're about one thing and then you get inside and everything's about sex.  Then I stumbled into this place.  I started reading postings and everyone seems so concerned about everyone even though they have never met these people.

I haven't struggled with depression my whole life or anything like that.  I am only 22 but feel so old.  I am very, very recently separated (let's face it broken up) with my ex-fiance.  We have dated for almost five years and have a son together who will be two on Saturday.  He hasn't treated me the best (never hit or anything physical like that just never around) and he's really not what I want my husband or even the father of my children to act like.  He does have moments of goodness and this is what makes it so hard because why can't he always act like that.  I know he's capable of it.  I told him we should separate but I know he's been thinking it for a long time.  He's been forcing things because of his family and because he feels ""respect"" and blah blah for me.  I stayed around because he's the father of my child and face it it's hard to find someone new when you're a woman and you already have a kid.  I love him very much and I guess I was just expecting him to wake up one day and say man I need to change or I'm going to lose this great girl.  I wanted to separate because I think that's the only way he's going to realize how good of a girl I am and how good I am for him.  Now I'm scared though that he'll never come to this realization or meet someone else.  He says he's not looking, but let's face it he's a man.  He says he needs at least 6 months to find himself.  It makes it hard on me because we have a son together and for this reason my ex is always coming around and actually now that we're not together we probably see him more. 

I have no family where I live and the last 5 years have been devoted to my ex and son.  I have managed to lose contact with any friends I had and never made any new ones.  I am now completely alone except for my son, which I feel like I can't take good care of because I'm always crying.  I'm a high school teacher and I had to take a couple days off this week because I'm so touchy and can cry if the wrong thought pops up in my head.    It's affecting every part of my life and it's so overwhelming.

I used to be afraid that if we ever split I would end up alone with only one son and no family; now I'm afraid that he'll never come back!  I really just need someone to talk to."
dsf,"Hello everyone, I am new here. I am Sarah and in my early thirties. I live in Europe and found this forum today! I just want to share my thoughts and because I was afraid anyone would find out about my feelings I searched for a foreign forum. And found it! I have been struggling all my life but after a series of events (death of dear aunt and suicide attempt off parent) I found myself starting therapy almost 2 years ago. At first everything was fine and I was learning a lot about myself and how to make my life easier and how to love myself. i really was hopeful and thought my life would finally get happier and maybe I would even meet some one to share my life with.... After a year of therapy I started feeling worse about myself and developed an eating disorder and a few months ago I also started feeling more and more depressed. At first I denied everything and even threatened to quit therapy because I was convinced time would heal me....well I now know that healing is not that easy. over the past two weeks I have been to a psychiatrist who wants to start me on Prozac (because it shouldn't make me gain weight, she thinks this would be the best ad. for me) and earlier this week i went to see my usual psychotherapist who said I was severely depressed and she urged me to start taking the medication because of my state of mind. I might loose my job in the near future and with all this extra stress my thoughts have been very scary. I am starting to think more and more about death and for this reason my therapist started talking about hospitalization! Off course I don't want that so I agreed earlier today to start with the medication....I am so scared about the side effects and don't know what i will do if I gain weight. Also I don't think I want to life if I loose my job...I think that will push me over the edge. 
I hope I can find the energy to read more messages on this board and maybe get a good feeling about life again. Bye for now, Sarah"
dsf,"My name is Kate and I am a 23 year old with a history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and now I have been recently diagnosed with depression (last week!) My breakdown started a month ago, however, I guess it has obviously been building up for awhile. I am going to warn you ... this may be a long post. Where do I begin?

I always worried, for as long as I can remember. One time that REALLY sticks out in my head was when I was about 10 or 11 years old and I was at a sleepover at my friend's house. Everyone was having fun, me included, until everyone started settling down. We were all reading books and I was reading a Babysitter's Club book. (Funny how you remember that stuff, isn't it?) Well anyway, there was a girl in the book who had diabetes, and she was always thirsty and would pee a lot (this sounds ridiculous, but I am in the medical field, and these are some signs that you may have diabetes.) So all of a sudden I remember thinking, ""I am thirsty right now .... could I have diabetes?!?"" I called my mom and was a mess. Silly story to some, but this is truly how far back I can remember my anxiety.

When I was 13, I started to see a psychologist, mainly because my parents divorced and my grandma (who was my best friend) died on cancer at the same time. I was an angry 13 year old and I really didn't get much out of it.

When I was 15, I got pregnant (it was crazy because I felt that I didn't fit the ""stereotype"") and told NO ONE. I think that I convinced myself that if I ignored it, that it wouldn't happen. I wouldn't have the baby. I was not fat in high school, but I was heavier than now, so I told people I had gained weight. It was in style to wear huge clothes then, so you really couldn't tell. My parents didn't even know about it until I was at the hospital 9 months later. Awful, I know ... I still can't believe it myself. (I gave the baby up for adoption.)

I always thought that people worried the way I did. I mean, I worried about everything and everyone around me. When I was 18 and in high school, I had my first anxiety attack. I felt fine that day, and then I woke up from a sound sleep with tightness in the chest, felt like my throat was closing up, and I was sweaty .... it was horrible. This went on for about 2 months straight. Every night, I would go to sleep and wake up with these episodes. I anticipated them.

Depression and anxiety BOTH run in my family, on both sides. (Lucky me!) Two family members have killed themselves, and my uncle right now is REALLY on edge with his depression.

I went away to college, only to come home a year and a half later, unsure of what the hell I wanted to do. When I was 19, I started seeing another psychologist and she seemed to help with the anxiety. I saw her for a year and slowly tapered off from seeing her at all. The attacks subsided and I was happier. I still always worried excessively.

I was taking classes at the community college and decided I wanted to be a nurse. I worked harder than I ever had, and I was proud of myself.

About 2 years ago, I started dating the man of my dreams. (Sounds silly, but he is the best.) Things have been amazing. However, after passing the first part of nursing, I failed the second and had to retake it a year later. It was a definite setback. My boyfriend was supportive and just amazing about it all. (He had already graduated.) The first year of our relationship was like the ""honeymoon phase"" the entire time. Things started to calm down a bit, and I went back to school. I was struggling, but i was getting by. Then in May of last year, his dad got sick. It wasn't a serious diagnosis, but he was kept in the ICU just in case since he had a history of heart problems. He died unexpectedly 2 weeks later, while I was there with his family. (This is the hospital that I work in by the way.) It was awful. rrImean, one of the worst things I witnessed in my life. SO I basically took care of his mom. I mean, my boyfriend was the man of the house, so to speak, after this, but when he wasn't there (he is a restaurant manager so he works 60 hours a week at least) I was. I dropped everything to help her when she needed it. (Did I mention that I failed nursing again at the same time, and was kicked out of the program?)

So recently, the past 2 months, I have been anxious about things. rrImean, I always am, but I just sensed something wasn't right. It was the same little things, like if my boyfriend didn't call me when he got home from work (even at 2 in the morning) I swore he was killed in a car accident. But I just started saying to my mom and my boyfriend ""something isn't right ... I think I need to go back to see my psychologist."" I didn't though. Then I had this breakdown. I was the first week of February, I was feeling fine. I was in class, daydreaming about what me and my boyfriend's kids' names would be someday, and went to see him. That night, we went to pick his sister up from getting her hair done, and she kept us waiting in the car for 40 minutes. I was getting mad because she didn't even call us to let us know what was going on. Then I started fidgeting and said ""I feel like I need a xanax ... like I might have an anxiety attack."" (I never took xanax except for when I flew.) And then 2 days later, I wake up and just feel so anxious and numb to everything and everyone .... INCLUDING HIM. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? Now, I have been feeling annoyed towards his mom lately ... she is a lot to handle and she just puts a lot of pressure on people, including me, to do whatever she wants.

I have been missing school, can barely go to work and just so upset. I haven't gone out with friends, I ignore their phone calls, and just feel so detached from my boyfriend and things I usually love doing. I don't even want to have sex, which sorry to sound gross, but I always wanted to ... more than my boyfriend. Has anyone else experienced this? I am so sad ... rrImean, I just feel so alone and this all feels like its not real, like I am watching a movie about this happening to someone else. Why can't I feel anything??? You don't go from feeling happy about school and crazy about your boyfriend, to just, NOT!

I started on Zoloft a week ago today and my dose goes from 25 mg to 50 mg today. Can anyone help me? The Xanax XR kind of helps with the racing thoughts that come with GAD, but I am just so so sad. Any insights? I apologize for the length, but I wanted to give background information."
dsf,"I'm 46 and have been depressed since I was maybe 5 years old. I was emotionally abused by two confused parents. Depression & alcoholism runs rampantly in my family - fortunately I escaped the alcoholism. I was diagnosed as having major depression when I was about 25 and I've been on medication since then. I've also had intensive psychotherapy and done lots of research on the subject. Nothing erases the stigma!! ""Depression"" is misnamed. It should be called serotonin-deficiency disorder or something long and fancy so people will respect it. Too many say, ""Depression? Snap out of it!"" Or ""Do something to cheer yourself up."" What bunk. It affects every part of your body. Last year I realized that some of my depression was caused by kidney failure. I escaped dialysis and will probably be OK. But what a relief to have something ""serious"" to blame my problems on! Everybody respects kidney failure as a ""real disease"". I had to disown my brother last year because his reaction to my failing health was to call me a loser and an embarrassment. Very typical reaction from him, although the rest of my family were supportive. I now have no brother. I should have done it a long time ago. It takes such a long time to come to a point where you believe you deserve something good in life. I'm intelligent, employed and don't do drugs or alcohol, never have, but sometimes I feel like a bum, a worthless waste of space, not worth the effort. I have to argue myself out of that mindset every day, and it's so exhausting, and people wonder why I'm tired all the time and have no energy. I'm very angry, too. I have never had a successful relationship and don't believe I ever can. I don't even believe it exists. No kids, either, but maybe that's a good thing. They take a lot of emotional energy. Anyway, I hate to sound like a whiner, but sometimes you have got to whine!! And I'm happy to listen to everybody else and give them my support. We're all in the same boat here."
dsf,"Hi I am Tracy and I have had depression and anxiety for about 10years.I am 35 and a wife and mum to 3 beautiful kids who deserve a mum who isn't ill. The biggest thing that gets me so frustrated with myself is the way depression makes me feel such a weak person, before I was ill I had a job, was the strong one where friends and family were concerned and basically could cope with whatever life threw at me .Now I am lucky if I can cope with getting through the day. I am on Efexor xl at the moment and have been for about a year. It is so nice to post this and not worry about being judged, it is lovely to know that other people understand. Well that's me"
dsf,"Hello All, I'm a 27 year old female from PA. I've been dealing with severe depression since my early 20's. I recently had two friends tell me that they think I may be bipolar. Hmm I'll have to disagree. I don't really have ""highs."" At least not anymore. Mostly just feel like blah. Sometimes it's so bad I think things would be better if I wasn't around. I would never commit suicide, but it doesn't stop the thoughts from clouding my head. I've had the therapy and been on medicines... celexa, paxil, combo of celexa and lamictal, lexapro, wellbutrin. NOTHING. I'm not taking anything right now, but am in the process of looking for a new therapist as my insurance recently changed. This sucks. Most of the time I feel nothing. Empty. I find it easier to get emotional and cry over a stupid TV show than over something in real life. Well, it's good to be here. Hopefully it'll help."
dsf,"I'm not sure where to start.  I've been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, disassociation, and bipolar.  I'm also a cutter, suicidal, I hear things and see things.  Needless to say I don't deal with stress very well. 

Sorry this isn't a good introduction; but I really do need some help.

I'm a college student only because the VA (veterans Affairs) is paying for it through their vocational - rehabilitation program.  I'm unemployed.  For 3 months I've been fighting with social services just to get food stamps.  I finally got them.  Beforehand food was scarce.  I've had eviction notices and by miracles my roommate and I manage to get just enough money to not get evicted at the last minute.  I've missed class and 2 therapy and other doctor appointments because I haven't had the gas money to get there.  I apply for jobs every day, but I have absolutely no luck getting a job.

So with all this any normal person would become naturally depressed.  But me, I'm losing my mind.  I can be happy and laughing and goofing off with my boyfriend one minute; but the next I'm kicking and hitting and seriously hurting him.  Then we end up in some stupid argument where all I say is shut up or go away, or whatever.   I just don't want to hear it. 

I know missing my therapy appointments hasn't helped.  I do have a psychiatrist appointment in 2 weeks and a therapy appointment in 3 weeks.  But I need some help now. 

I've lost all my motivation to do anything.  I've been in bed today for 17 hours and I just feel so angry.  Angry and fearful.  The only thing is that I don't know what I'm angry and fearful about. 

My mood shifts so quickly and swiftly that I've lost complete control of who or what I am.  The more I try to relax the Angrier and more fearful I get.  It's like I have to stay occupied just to keep my mind occupied and keep it from traveling a million miles a second.

I just need to get back on the semi - sane track.  Right now I'm a million light years from there."
dsf,"Lunch yesterday in a busy city-centre bar. Full of lawyers drinking wine, expensive suits, folders of documents, brief snippets of conversations waft past me. ""there were 17 indictments on the file"" Gales of laughter, ice buckets, steak sandwiches, bowls of pasta. I sat in a free space a couple of seats away from a young woman and waited for my food, downing bitter shandy in the heat. I then became aware that my neighbor was conducting a continuous conversation with herself. At first I thought she was talking to me, and turned to look, caught her eye, and realized. Her conversation, mostly murmured, not at all intrusive, continued throughout the hour or so I spent there, always addressed to herself alone, or to a figure I could not see. Every so often she went to the bar and came back with another tall glass of lemonade - or perhaps it was fizzy water. As she talked she made small jerky gesticulations with her arms in front of her; I could not hear what she was talking about, her speech was less loud than the noise from the crowded tables in the centre of the room, but the tone and volume of her conversation rose and fell; there was a sense of excitement at times, then of humor, sometimes of irritation, sometimes of the mundanity of everyday speech. The bar staff seemed to know her, one of them, a tall boy with a goatee came and chatted to her briefly. I finished my food, which was not that great, read the paper, drank another beer, occasionally watched the lawyers, ruminated, day-dreamed, and then left. My neighbor stayed on, still talking, still sipping her lemonade."
dsf,"Hi My name is Tracy, I am 44 years old and have three children 4,8 and 11, I've been going through something lately I wake up in the morning and its like I'm in a different world. I cry about everything. I look at pictures of my kids when they were younger and I burst into tears. I have nothing to be depressed about , good wife, good kids ,good job, I don't understand what's going on. This is totally out of my character. Now it's getting to the point to where I don't want to go to work on night shifts because I'm afraid something will happen to them while I'm at work. Also when I have to sleep during the day I have trouble falling to sleep Its like I'm scared to sleep. I have also wake up from a deep sleep with panic attacks, I have learned how to talk myself out of them. Everything is so emotional it's like I'm morning the death of one of my children. Any way its driving me and my wife crazy, Its not all the time it comes and goes, other times I am fine. My wife says I'm so much more loving toward my family when I'm going through this. I am on zoloft per family doctor. But it don't seem to help. I also have sleep apnea which I read can cause depression. Well if anybody Knows what I'm going through please respond, I don't know if its depression or some kind of sleep problem. Thanks for listening"
dsf,"Hi, i joined earlier last year in quite a bad state. doubt if anyone will remember me!

I kind of  sort of 'snapped out' of it if that's at all possible. I realized i wasn't just upset, but i was never diagnosed as depressed, so i'm so sorry if I'm offending anyone by posting here. 

But you guys really helped me when i was last here.

From the start of this year i've been so 'down' it's unreal. At first i put it down to stress of january exams but even though the exams are over i am still so miserable (for want of a better word). I have a great boyfriend who i love very much and vice versa. we have been going out for about 6 months and everything is going great, but my moods are starting to put a strain on him (tom).

i have put it down to the fact that I am really low on self esteem at the moment for some reason, but i don't want get up in the morning because i just don't feel i can face anyone. i LOVE shopping, it makes me feel so good, but it doesn't do anything for me now. I get a bit of Seasonal Affective Disorder, and even sun showers haven't cheered me up.

Because i'm so down i've become really irritable lately, like permanent PMT and like i said, i think its really starting to put pressure on tom, because he's always on the receiving end of my moods.

I don't want to mess everything up or slip too far down the depression road again.

I just don't know what to do or how to explain things to tom (my boyfriend).

Any words of wisdom you could offer me? i think things really might be in trouble."
dsf,"I'm new here, and I ought for help.

For the past month I've had a crush on this girl  .. but not a normal crush .. a real CRUSH CRUSH, the type of crush you really feel you need her since the first time you see her.
She is my friend as of right now, I want to ask her out  .. but I am afraid she rejects me, and she wouldn't be my friend anymore.

I've been with depression for the past 4 days already, I even had suicidal thoughts. Last night I was looking for a HotLine to call and tell my story, I felt like I needed to talk to somebody.  
I have friends, but not those type of friends that you can rely on, tell your story, and cry on their shoulders. Basically, i'm by myself in this world.

I love my parents, but I never tried talking about it because I just can't. They wouldn't understand, they ask too many questions .. we even had a minor discussion about me telling my mom NOT to throw the water bottle (I told her 5 times not to throw it), and guess what she did .. she threw the water bottle .. and she told ""rrAhh, you should've told me"" .. Bad communication indeed, she needs to pay more attention to what I say.

I haven't eaten for a day because the depression has gotten worse .. last night a good ""cyber - friend"" logged on, and I knew I could talk to that person .. she's not kid, she's a grown woman (40 years old), she has kids, so I knew she would understand perfectly. She talked me into not thinking about suiciding because of that.

Last night was the day that I cried the most, in my entire life. I'm still depressed, a little bit relieved because I actually talked to someone and let all that out.

I just need advices, I've been thinking of that girl ALL the time .. I wrote her letters as a ""secret admirer"", the ending of the letter was always the same:
""To the world you might be one person, but to one person you might be the world.""

I was also thinking that I was going to ask her out .. but like I said above, I'm afraid she might reject me and I fall into a deeper depression.

Please help, what should I do?

I'm 16, and I live in Miami.

Thank you if you have read my story.

EDIT: I have lost my self - respect, and lowered my self - esteem, and feel like if I'm a nobody."
dsf,"The base is 3 bound boxes of Remerol tablets (similar to Effexor). Above that is my trusty 300 mg slow release wellbutrin. Next, Sonata for occasional use; and then onto concerta per my request. Finally there is Risperdal and Topemax - a headache medication.

I tried to kill myself last spring and came very, very close. This event has opened up spiritual dimensions more terrible than I thought possible. Forgive me for sounding weird, but with my life just one little hop, one small step away from obliteration, the return back became a long journey. And most of me didn't even make it back - after the attempt I was hospitalized on a ward with a sociopath as my neighbor. I was naive and even befriended him. Far too late in the relationship I realized that this person may not have my best interests in hand. So I left the hospital but I left beaten. Then I went home to my family and some of them reacted terribly against my illness. I felt powerless, like I was spreading some miserable disease. My struggle goes on but at least I am alive. I believe in many things I never used to now, and that gives me hope.

To anyone reading this, I just hope you won't toy with your life. Live a long one, it's important you do."
dsf,"Feeling Good is an excellent book. I have re-read a few times when I've felt the need. If you are looking at something for anxiety and panic, I suggest Mastering Anxiety and Panic revision III (map-3) by David Barlow. I suffered from anxiety, panic attacks and agoraphobia from the time I was 12 until last year...that's 30 years. Nothing had ever helped until I found a therapist that uses that program. A different way of looking at things and I have to say that I worked miracles for me. I am driving, flying, going to concerts, sporting events...things I haven't done for over 20 years. I NEVER thought I could get better and only went because my boyfriend of 8 years was honest with me and told me that he didn't know if he could spend the rest of his life going every place alone. That was a wake up call for me and to my surprise, I found that I COULD do it. I still have my depression and I am endlessly working on being medicated correctly for that.... all of you know how that is. You can buy just the workbook www.oup.com (Oxford University Press). Well worth the money."
dsf,"Hi everyone. I am also a new member. I'm 22 years old and a single mother of one. I have had bipolar tendencies since I was a young child and was diagnosed at 16 or 17. The past few years since my daughter was born have been the best ones for my moods. I attribute part of that to the success I seemed to have on Lithium for two years. I stupidly went off the medicines and my thyroid medicines as well in November without telling my doctor. Lately things have gotten fairly rough. I know I have to get back in to the doctor, and I will. It's just that my life is so busy right now that it's hard to find the time (and the courage!). I'm glad I found this great site. It is great to hear others stories and to not feel alone. So, nice to ""meet"" you all."
dsf,Okay so I'm doing a really shitty job of keeping up with this journal. So Sam came and went. Not before I went to a wedding and got drunk and told her parents that I was in love with her . Yea.. umm.. I'm gay. I then told her that I thought moving to Oregon was a bad bad idea. Not because I was in love with her but because moving to a city for a boy that you're in love with but has no interest in you. Not such a good idea. so anyways that made things all fucked up and she left and we weren't on the best terms  besides that the roommate thing just kind of fell apart. I didn't get the apartment across from shaye because of credit issues. So now I'm going to just move into her place. We'll see how that turns out... If we kill each other or not. I'm not on the lease so if it sucks I can just move out  there are a few boys that are into me. However I don't think that my soul really wants to be with anyone right now. I have something wrong with my heart  I'm doing blood work on Monday to figure out what's going on. And I took last week off for no reason at all. So I guess a lot has happened in the last 15 days. I should really try to keep up with this journal.
dsf,"this is my first post here.  Just wondering if anyone else has this problem.  I can't seem to motivate myself to do something with my life.  I'm married, no kids, quit school a couple years ago, just working the same job for five years, going nowhere.  I'm afraid of any kind of change, and I sometimes feel like life is pointless.  I get in these ruts where I'm stuck in this deep, dark pit of anguish and depression and everything feels completely hopeless.  It comes and goes, but these past few weeks have been particularly bad.  I was diagnosed several years ago with ocd, which has a lot to do with it, since I work myself into a frenzy of worry, imaging the worst possible scenarios for every situation, and I just shut down and don't want to think about anything, and it's hard to pull myself together and function like a normal human being.   Prozac helps, but I don't take it like I should. Just venting a little"
dsf,"having just cheated on a girl i've known for over 3 years, i have felt not only depressed, but also physically sick from the moment i got on the train home at the weekend. i am incapable of vomiting because i have a stomach ulcer from 4 years ago as a result of depression at a previous job. i have repeatedly apologized profusely to her, and today was told that she would not be able to see me before she leaves to go back abroad. i can only hope at this stage that she will contact me when she returns to the uk. the worst part is that i don't seem to have a reason for going with the other girl."
dsf,"This may not be the right place for me to write but I just had to write somewhere.  I have not been clinical diagnosed depressed but I am not feeling ""happy"" right now.  I just can't seem to get over that my son's father, who left us 4 years ago, has a new family with a younger girl and another child on the way.  I can't seem to get myself out to meet to new people.  I know that I am the really the only one that can make things better for me.  I don't feel connected here where I am living.  I feel like I am missing out on something.  I just don't feel wanted anymore.  The only thing that I am glad about right now is that my son's father is finally caught up on child support.  Am I crazy, depressed or just plain stupid?"
dsf,"I'm a 24 year old woman living in Florida with my husband. I have been severely depressed for 6 months, and now looking back I can see that it actually started about a year and a half ago. If only I could go back and warn myself.

Like many of you, I have been suffering depression since I was very young. In fact, I can remember being in first grade, coming home and going to bed for the rest of the night. Of course, back then it felt more like fear. In 7th grade, I asked my mother if I was a manic depressive because I had read about it and I felt I had all the symptoms. She scoffed and said it was just normal teen hormones that made me feel that way.

I love my mother and she has always been there for me. I used to call her at 2 in the morning crying and she would talk to me until I felt better. However, when I call her up today, she still doesn't understand when I tell her I am depressed. She thinks I need to get up and start doing things until I snap out of it. I try to tell her I have bills screaming at me and I still can't get out of the house to find work. I think she is in denial. Now, with all of the information I find on this site, I think I may even be bipolar.

When I found the man I wanted to marry, I warned him that I had experienced many deep depressions in my lifetime and that it was probably likely to happen again someday. He said he would stay by my side no matter what, and he has. Unfortunately, it is painfully apparent that he has no idea at all how to handle it. When he tries to talk to me and cheer me up, I say mean things to him until we are both raising our voices. Let me tell you, when I'm like this, I don't back down either. I usually say something hurtful and then grind my teeth in anger for a while. He gets mad too, but it is also painfully apparent that he forgives me. Then, I feel like a real jerk.

I just started seeing a psychologist, since I haven't had a job since last August and it's clear that I don't know my way out of this. I have only met with her once, but I think I will like her. She has told me to do a few simple things everyday until our next meeting on Wednesday. She wants me to get 1/2 hour of sunlight everyday, 15 minutes of exercise, and try to make a simple daily schedule to follow. I'm a bit worried because I haven't been able to do them because I just don't sleep right anymore. It is 8am and I haven't slept yet. I may fall asleep in a few hours, only to toss and turn and then wake up in the evening feeling like crap. I have tried some medicines but they don't help. Have any of you had this problem? What did you do?"
dsf,"Here's my answer to your age question. Sadly, I am 29 years old: sniffle1: Don't get me wrong. I don't want to be completely alone for the rest of my life. There's a sentimental part of me that yearns for companionship with a guy, but I have such a tall hurdle to overcome before I can even get to that yet. Yeah, but I can relate to the peace and quiet thing by myself. It really is such a luxury nowadays (personally speaking). One thing I reflected on was that I live in a family of 8 people, and maybe that's why I feel so claustrophobic and irritable around lots of people. Essentially, there's no secure privacy, really. Yup, like you I used to live independently when I went to school. I'm on a bit of a break right now, but will go back in September where I'll share an apartment with a roommate I don't know. Right now, I'm mooching off my parents' food and shelter. At age 29, I feel like a little child. And by the way, I'm unemployed too. I tried all summer to land a job, but in vain. I only worked one day for Elections Canada, and that was it. Oh well, a paycheck is a paycheck, right? The thing is, I can't stand living with somebody I hardly know either. Sometimes I just don't want to greet somebody at breakfast, or say a polite 'hello, how are you, or how was your day?"". When I battle depression and social anxiety, I really really need the comfort of familiar people around me at times. The last thing I need is a complete stranger sharing my quarters. But, it's something I can't help. I'll probably isolate myself in my room for a while. At least I get cable TV and the internet. Then again, I'll probably become a complete hermit during the school year."

dsf,"We have been playing Quake 4 almost every night for a little while. We play online against other players using Xbox Live and it is very cool. Most people are friendly. We have made some 'friends' and we find them and play with them. One time I found some person talking too much trash and you can go in a mute them or set a preference to never see them again. Well, last night I encountered a group who had a feud going. One kid was talking too much trash and people on the other side were just going with it. I figured one game was a not a big deal. But sometimes you end up finding them again and again in the same night. I have this guy some slack and didn't say anything but then later I got to play as part of the same team with him. What a jerk. He kept asking me to give him the flag so he score it and get the points instead of me. Forget about the team winning, this guy wanted all the points for himself and didn't care about the team. I had to set him straight, and after the game I had to report him as being a trash player and set in my preferences to never see him again. After that I saw the other players and they were all nice. It only takes one guy to ruin a great experience. Overall, playing online with all these people and talking with them is great, you just have to know when to cut someone loose. Eventually when many people report him as being a jerk, he will be banned from the game. Oh well."
dsf,"I'm a traitor. I went to check out the other room without anyone knowing that it was me, just to see who was in there. While I saw someone stabbing me in the back, someone else pm'd me. Having a go, blah blah, how I shouldn't discriminate against people and make them leave THIS room.

I was thinking ""wtf?"" I never made people leave this room. All my problem people are on ignore and are left there *as it is in the rules*

So anyway, I just turns out that someone let this person know that I was a host from this forum masquerading, as if to get information from these people that have ""abandoned"" this chat. I Don't care about the other chat, other people shouldn't.
You guys are welcome to wherever you want to go. You are banned for putting the link in the room and whispering it to people, which is AGAINST the rules.
I know that the person that pm'd me feels bad, It ISN'T my fault. I didn't yell at her for making the mistake, I was understanding. I've made that mistake, I feel bad for it when I do. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO MESS UP.

So why people must bring stuff from THAT room into THIS room and make me so frigging angry again that I have to leave is beyond me. Why, if there are two separate rooms, can't stuff from the rooms STAY IN THAT ROOM?!?!
It's so much easier. People won't get confused that way.

At this point I would just like to reiterate that I have no problems whatsoever with any of the people that go to either room. Anyone I can't handle talking to, I don't talk to. I just take objection to being asked about it here, where I come to forget about my problems, not be reminded of them.

And now, I've totally lost the thread of where I was going with this post, thanks to a whole bunch of reasons, and I'm getting too stressed to type, and all that's just irritated me further.

When I remember the point, I will add it or post it underneath.

Has anyone tried both Cymbalta, and Effexor?  Which one helped more?  or are they about the same. Should I go back to Cymbalta??  Has anyone quit a medication, tried something else, then went back to that same medication?  or should I try a different medication all together?

Or, I thought, a bath sounds nice, then this sinister thought, ""just slip under the water"". My rational brain is saying I would absolutely never hurt myself, so why these thoughts?  WHAT THE HECK ??!

I'm going to try to become a tattoo artist and move down there to be with her soon. we are amazing in person but when we are apart it is horrible. i went from living near her to far away and i hate it. i think about her all day at work and can't talk to her because i don't have a phone at work. i can't stop digging into her past.

when we do fight i hurt myself and it makes me feel better. i cant afford professional help or medicine because i have no insurance. i am getting better and i am happy that I'm moving with her. but what do i do until then?"
dsf,"Where to start.... Well, I guess I'm here because I think I have depression. I did recently talk to a therapist about it a couple of weeks ago. I guess it did some good because I feel like I may have gotten to the root of my problems. She told me that I was depressed and that I have probably had a low grade depression for most of my life. I kind of thought that I was depressed, because when I would read an article about depression with 10 yes or no questions I would usually answer yes to nine of them. The original reason my wife and I went to a counselor in the first place was because my wife was mad about my occasional habit of looking at pornography on the internet. I understand this bothers her and I do not want to do anything that will upset her. I could never give her an acceptable reason why I did it. I really do not know why myself. I do not think that I have an addiction to sex. It does not dominate my thoughts or life by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I think that I am pretty ""tame"" compared to most males. Anyway, this causes a lot of strife in my marriage because my wife considers this cheating on her. Well, back to depression. We got to talking about this in counseling and the counselor asked me if I'd ever been molested before. Oh boy. Well, this has always been the big secret part of my life. When I was 6 or 7 years, a female cousin of mine, who was about 4 years older, played some ""touching"" games with me over the course of 2 summers. It was all just touching, but I knew it was wrong. She would tell me that I could never tell anyone because I would get in trouble. So I didn't, until that therapy session. No, I had never told my wife because I always felt embarrassed and like I was to blame because I did not do anything to stop my cousin. I pretty much told the therapist (and my wife of course), everything that had happened to me. I got REALLY upset and probably cried more than anytime in my adult life. I felt somewhat better after talking, but inside I still feel ashamed and responsible for it. The counselor said that because of those incidences, I have had a low grade depression all these years because of holding it all in. I have ALWAYS had a hard time expressing my feelings about anything to anyone. That's just me. I told the therapist that I could see the low grade depression in my day to day life, but there are times when I feel like there is a huge, massive black cloud on me. I can be doing just about anything when suddenly I have this overwhelming feeling of dread and emptiness. There are times that I feel like if I could wish for my own death at that instant, I would gladly do it. When I don't have those bad lows, I just feel numb. The therapist said I might want to try medication, but I already take two different things for chronic physical conditions, and I really do not want to take anymore drugs. I don't like doing anything that I used to do; reading, sports, movies, etc. I have a teenaged son who is just terrific. He is extremely intelligent and just a great kid. I do not want my ""condition"" affecting him anymore than it already has. My wife is sometimes supportive, but I think she is tired of my moods. I have not had the porn problems any longer and I feel like I have gotten past that. (The therapist attributed those times of porn weakness to depression and looking for a way out). I feel like since the counseling sessions that the low grade depression has gotten worse. I am glad that I talked about the things that happened and how I've felt, but I really do feel worse than before. Is there anything I can do besides more drugs? I just don't think those are the answer. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know."
dsf,"I seem to have depression the worst, first thing in the morning lately.  Just started with a new pdoc after 7 months. with another pdoc since this latest episode occured.  My old pdoc thought I could have a mild bipolar disorder but wasn't sure.  My 20 mg of prozac had stopped working after several years of keeping me stable.  She started me on lamictal and I am now up to 100 mg / day.  Stopped the prozac in early January and got worse, but not right away.  I was having a good week / bad week type pattern depending on where I was in my menstrual cycle while I was on the prozac.  I have battled depression on and off for 20 years.  Particularly bad postpartum and this recent episode.  I am 41 years old and haven't felt this bad since I had my daughter 8 years ago. 

My new doctor thinks I don't have an ounce of bipolar and that I am just in a depression (I tend to agree with her).  We decided together to add Lexapro to the mix and see if that helps me level out all the days of the month.  I have been on it almost 2 weeks patiently waiting for some results - I am well aware of the waiting game.  I am also taking Xanax XR in the evenings for sleep and to avert morning anxiety.  I take my Lamictal in the morning and a very small (half of the lowest dose of xanax) as well.  I seem to get moving and can be quite productive during my day after I take the Lamictal / xanax - don't know if this is a placebo effect??

My question is, has anyone experienced this a.m. depression that seems to lift a bit later in the day?  Also, does anyone take Lamictal for unipolar depression?  The last thing I want is to be taking too much of anything and further putting off good health.  Starting to wonder if the Xanax XR in the evening is giving me this early morning dread??"
dsf,"Hello, my name is Joe and I have been battling some form of depression, but I do not know what type or how severe it is. I have a family history of bipolar depression but I am not sure if this is a disease that is genetic to such an extent. Does it skip generations? My moods swing from euphoria to deep depression to where I contemplate just cutting away from my life and vanish. I am not suicidal; just feel at times isolation is the answer. I have one trigger I know of and it is usually when I am lacking in knowledge of a current situation I may be in. This make sense? Like tonight, I am out of town on business and working very late on some complex worksheets. I started getting depressed after the 12th hour of working and getting nowhere. This will then lead to insomnia and I will once again, for the second night in a row, be up all night working and mind wandering contemplating just getting in my car and driving to a remote town and re-invent myself. I have tried professional help, but to no avail I am just as bad if not worse. I figured since I am online most the day I would search for a forum that might lead me on a better path. After all shucking corn in Nebraska for room and board isn't such a great option the next morning. Well thank you for this opportunity to at least get this off my mind for at least tonight."
dsf,"My bottom line concern is that I'm suddenly afraid of men. When a man speaks to me in public I'm suspicious of his intentions, and when a man was openly flirting with me two days ago I left the store and then became afraid that he might follow me home and had to go sleep with my 4 year old in his room with the door locked that night. I'm even nervous and suspicious of men I've known, like spouses of friends.
Background. My husband is in the military and has been deployed. He's been gone since September and since the beginning I've had a fear of being in the house alone at night and it has progressed to this. I'm a fairly sane person for the most part. I dealt with some PPD when our son was born and my OBGYN gave me Xanax which was NO GOOD. My PCP put me on Lexapro which worked out just fine and I weaned off of it about a year and a half ago. I know this behavior is abnormal, but I can't seem to stop it. Can I have a little push in the right direction??"
dsf,"42 year old male newbie, just discovering that I suffer from depression. While there has been evidence all throughout my life, and while I have family members that have suffered from depression (grandmother committed suicide), I for some reason am just figuring out now that I suffer from the disease. My questions for those much more experienced and knowledgeable on the forum. 1. How would you go about your initial steps of diagnosis and treatment? I currently do not have med insurance, so cost is certainly an issue (we should have medical insurance in place in about a month, as part of my wife's new employer package). 2. I take a healthy dose of vitamins daily, including proteins such as L-Tyrosine, which helps me feel really good when I'm not under the effects of depression. Does anyone on the forum have experience with L-Tyrosine and its impact on their feelings of depression? I understand that the amino acids help with the production of dopamine and helps with brain function. Any comments? A little background: I am just coming off a very successful 4 year period where I started a complicated new business and got married again. However, during these last few months I have been unable to work at my previous pace, putting my business in real jeopardy. In fact, there are only a couple of days per week where I seem to be able to work, and typically only a few hours at a time during those days. When I do work I get exhausted quickly. Today, I had a major conference call that required some preparation. I was very up during the call, but then collapsed afterward in complete exhaustion. Seems to be the story for me recently, I can psych myself up for short bursts of performance, then I quickly decline again in an inability to concentrate on anything other than light web surfing. I continue to get up early and exercise daily. I live a healthy lifestyle, eat well, and walk 5+ miles every morning. I sleep regular hours, however, will sleep a few hours during the day during my 'down' days.  Looking back at my past, I am now clearly seeing times in my life where my performance level went down drastically, or where I had problems with relationships. At the time, I didn't realize anything was going on, or I simply didn't understand it. I can now go recall having real problems with my grades during my freshman year of high school. At the time, I recall saying to myself that I couldn't understand why I was performing so badly. It was as it something was holding me back and I could not overcome it. At the time, I just kept studying and working harder, but I was unsuccessful. Eventually, I got through it and my grades went back to normal. But all of these years I never really understood what happened in that freshman year, until now. In summary, there have been many other times in my life where things have fallen apart and I have not understood why. My past is littered by successful businesses that I have created and then have eventually failed, usually by my inability to maintain my performance level. There has obviously been a pattern that I do not yet understand, but at least now I am beginning to see why there was a downturn. Thankfully, I have now met the women of every man's dreams. While she knows I am depressed I have not yet let her know the depths of my despair or of my recent understanding of my past behavior. The good news here is that I have great family support, but I am wrestling with how much to tell my wife about what is going on inside my head. She gets stressed easily and will worry deeply about me. I'm not sure I want to lay that all out on her. Anyone else find themselves in this dilemma? Well, thank you for giving me the opportunity to share and to join this forum."
dsf,"It was Gavin and Janie's wedding last weekend and Rory came over on Wednesday evening in preparation. We spent Thursday afternoon trailing around Leeds trying to buy trousers because he claimed his current ones were too shiny for Best Man purposes. £70 later and he forgot to wear them on the day. I also had purposes in Leeds as I had agreed to speak to a woman from Radio 4 about my experiences with depression. We got in touch with each other through a poster in SHIP asking for people willing to talk about themselves and their problems. The lady was sensible, sympathetic, informed and, most importantly, Taking A Sensible Approach. It was a far better experience than my time talking to Kerrang! Radio. Anyway, my contribution will be part of a show about depression called Is It Normal?, one of a series of four half hour shows to be aired around August looking at a variety of health issues and the normalcy or lack-thereof of each of them. The evening's journey to Southport was described as turgid. The cumulative train journey time was two and half hours, but there was a half hour break in Manchester where we raided Sainsbury's for biscuits as well. There was a reasonable amount of wildlife to be seen from the windows - I spotted two foxes, three rabbits and incalculable numbers of horses, cows and sheep. We didn't get to our hotel until after 10pm, by which time we were too tired to care about the shabbiness of our surroundings. The bathroom had mould, there was sheets not a duvet (and a woolen blanket, which, of course, I'm allergic to), one thin pillow each, dirty windows and the hotel bar closed at 11pm. I drowned my sorrows in bourbon. The biscuits that is, not the drink. Friday started grey and windy but by lunchtime the weather had cleared up and it was a beautiful, sunny day. The trip to the golf course where the wedding was taking place (don't ask) took us through pretty roads with old houses and woods. We were some of the last to arrive which was quite good as there wasn't too much time to worry about the logistics or any problems which might be about to arise. The service was quite quick, civil ceremonies usually are. The room was decked with flowers and all the men were wearing purple flowers. Janie was wearing a purple suit and Gavin was in a coordinating shirt and tie. The photographs were taken outside near the putting green but we didn't get too many strange looks: I believe weddings are quite common there. Everyone lazed around for a while before we were called in to eat. I had been told that the club had said they were more than happy to ensure I had vegan food, so I was some what taken back when they presented me something very similar to lasagna, slathered in what was clearly béchamel sauce. Then they tried to tell me it had vegetarian cheese in it. We managed to reach a compromise of being cooked vegetables in sweet and sour sauce, which turned out to be far more appetizing than I was anticipating. For dessert they tried to feed me fruit salad. My idea of fruit salad is obviously far removed from theirs however, as my glass featured some black grapes (edible), a few slices of apple (inedible), some pineapple (ditto), some melon balls (acceptable but I had melon for a starter, and that had been unripe), some orange slices (don't get me started on oranges) and a few pieces of unidentifiable fruit. Where was the raspberries and strawberries? The banana, plum, Granny Smiths, green grapes? Wasn't impressed. Later, I was practically forced by Rory to eat some chocolate coated cake (""They cost £5 each! You need to eat it!"") so on top of my own guilt, the lady who seemed to be coordinating all the food had the gall to try and tell me off for eating something which obviously wasn't vegan. What business was it of hers? We left early on Saturday morning, or what I perceive as early, at least. I wanted to stop off in Manchester to leave some posters advertising the Ladyfest All Dayer, but Rory refused, saying that he was too tired and his bags were too heavy. So we came straight home and I spent the afternoon sleeping. Afterwards we had pizza and discussed my weight problems. The solution was decided on to be no more pizza. And no more many things. I got weighed and it's far worse than I thought. We discussed the possibility of Slim Fast and diet pills, and my mum's offer of paying for liposuction. We agreed I should keep a food diary, stick to my exercise plan, cut back drastically on my calorie intake and if that doesn't make a successful impact, then to try the pills and Slim Fast, though I'd rather not have to eat that, it being full of milk. My mum said if I lose the weight I want to first then she'll pay for the remaining lumpy bits to be removed as a birthday present. Now I just need some self control again. On Monday we went to the end of year show at college. There was some wonderful things, though it seems that there have been less good exhibits every year since I started going. Are the students getting worse? Am I starting to be more critical of art? Or a combination? Rory went home afterwards and I was left alone again. Left to my food diary and my shit book (I'll Go To Bed At Noon - how it got short listed for the Booker I have no idea) and my self loathing. Bleugh. Two weeks to more hugs. Finally, it seems Jo Brand is wanting song suggestions for a compilation called Music to Drain Radiators To. Naturally..."
dsf,"Does anyone else get very angry at just stupid little things?  It seems like over the last few months everyone around me is getting all they want out of life, and I am suffering with depression.  Which, of course, makes me feel worse and then I feel guilty for not being happy for them.  BUT, I also get angry when they ""flaunt"" their happiness around me.  My roommate just started seeing someone she met off eharmony.  We both signed up at the same time for fun, and while I was rejected time and time again, she was SO picky and then started seeing the first guy she went out with.  I am happy that she found someone and she really deserves it, but I get so ANGRY that she is constantly doing things with him.  It's like I've been replaced.  I feel like a 5 year old for thinking that, but I just can't help how I feel.  Today, for example, I asked her if she wanted to watch a movie I had gotten off our digital cable.  We have it until 9 tonight and she said she'd like to.  I was pretty excited seeing as how I hadn't been invited to a couple of events this weekend in lieu of ZACH going.  Well, she just came down stairs and said that Zach is going to be  coming over now.  This ticks me off because she broke our plans, and I don't have a way to ""escape"" when they are here.  I'm sure she's going to want to watch that movie with Zach, and, I know I'm being selfish, but I don't WANT him here tonight.  I haven't gotten to see Angela all weekend and the one night we have before going back to work HE is going to be here.  So I have to put on my happy face and pretend that I am glad for her and happy that she has someone and engage him in conversation when all I will feel like doing is crying.  It's unfair!  Why does it seem like when you are depressed, everyone around you has these GREAT things happening in their life.  Angela just got a promotion, a new car, and now a new boyfriend.  I am stuck in the same job, same crushing car payment, and I haven't dated anyone in over 6 years."
dsf,"i can only do so many intro's, then i get real sick of talking (writing) about me. i have depression/anxiety. I'm not medicated, and though the va would provide medicines, I'm done with them for now. Now that I've not homeless anymore i have the stability to get proper rest and nutrition, which have been sorely lacking. I've just started taking vitamins, and though i did get a membership to the ymca to work out, I've yet to bottle up the anxiety enough to go in. i used to love being in the gym, now it's available, and I'm frozen to my apartment. it will come. I've had stability for three weeks now, and I'm essentially relearning life. I've had to make myself go out and walk around the park at three in the morning to get exercise. With God's help, the support i can gather about, and an open heart, i will regain my sense of self. Thank you for being here so that i can post this. i know that you folks understand. Peace"
dsf,"This morning M finally confessed and now I know the truth: This IS summer here. I realize I spend a lot of time talking about food, the weather and nudity on this blog, but these seem to be re-occurring themes of my new life and, really -- what's more important than having nice food while naked in excellent weather? Not much, I say. So, despite the long arduous months of patiently awaiting the promised beauty of a Dutch summer, what I'm really getting is this: Virtually constant canopy of gray/black clouds? Check! Scarves and light jackets lest the freezing summer temperatures turn your nipples to stone? Check! Got your umbrella for sudden downpours that may or may not contain hail? Check Check! Surly attitude because you can't wear your pretty sandals (unless you like blue toes) and your boyfriend's been lying to you for months about the upcoming lekker warm weather? Check and check and check! Try to ignore that previous blog entry within which I detailed all the nice things about Holland at this time of year and the fact that the weather was oven-hot. Apparently, that was a freak of nature. Though I do still love the little lambs."
dsf,"OK, for you guys out there- I apologize ahead of time... It's that time of the month for me - and I thought I was doing pretty well until this afternoon. It's like my hormones, brain chemicals and whatever else have done a complete 180 on me. Driving home today I prayed I would just make it safely because I was starting to feel so out of control.
I want to scream (which I can't because of where I live) or break things- or whatever else to get this anger out!!!  I don't even know where it's coming from!! All I know is everything is pissing me off!!!!!!!! Has anyone else ever felt like this? What do you do? I can't cry- the tears won't come. I'm thinking about watching a show I like, but I don't seem to like anything right now. Also, I'm supposed to be working from home right now, which is the last thing I want to do. I just want to take some Klonopin and make myself chill and go to sleep. I won't, though, because I'm still feeling responsible at this moment, despite my feelings of rage. I just want to get rid of these feelings!!! Any ideas??"
dsf,"Read this if you want, I just needed to let this out somewhere instead of being bottled up inside me... Today I went out and took my driving test for the first time at age 18, yes...18...and I tried to keep a positive attitude throughout the whole day so I could overcome my nervousness. Anyway I got there and took the test and I failed...miserably...all day long today after that I have just became really depressed because the following things are running through my mind: - Younger kids than me pass everyday, apparently I must be f***ing retarded and worthless... All my friends passed no problem...why can't I? Why am I so stupid... Everyone had so much confidence in me and I've let them all down, I feel like I shouldn't be alive since I'm so worthless... I have only 2 more chances to pass this before I have to fill out some form saying that I'm too f***ing retarded to drive and that I need more help as I'm too stupid to try again myself...so the state has to approve my dumb a** to try again... I feel like I'm not even good enough to do anything if I can't pass some simple f***ing test that everyone else can pass...why am I so dumb? Everyone say ""It's so easy!"", ""It's not difficult, I passed my first time!"", it just makes me want to kill myself since I can't live up to the standards of this world...and may other things I just can't find words to describe...I'm not asking anyone to comfort me or make me feel better or anything, I just wanted to let this out...thanks for that..."
dsf,"My purpose for posting this is that I'm at a dead end and don't know where else to turn. I'm 39 and I'm sure have been suffering from depression most my whole life. My life has been one failure after another, in relationships, jobs, and anything else. I had been on antidepressants for about 10 years and then stopped after I got arrested for a DUI and felony hit and run. The man who was injured received a cut on his face after chasing after me when I split the scene, that was the whole extent of his injuries. After the arrest I was feeling so bad it made no difference whether I took them or not. The charges were dropped but I had to wait day after day for a year or more just waiting for them to recharge me, which my attorney was sure they were going to do. That was 2 years ago and I think the experience did some very serious and real damage to me. I just lost my job in my probationary period of 2 months. I have worked so hard to create some kind of financial security for myself (BA in Psychology, technical degree in computers, numerous computer certifications) but where ever I go I don't fit in to the group and find myself alienated and let go. Some many failed romantic relationships, never having friends, and what family members I have are abusive and are incapable of providing healthy support. Most nights I calm myself enough to fall asleep by fantasizing about killing myself and the relief that was provide. I feel like a freak physically. I shortened my fingers on my right hand by 1/2 inch and my hand is deformed because I hit the wall in my apartment one night about 4 years ago after I was let go from a job and my girlfriend broke up with me at the same time.

Of course what I have stated so far isn't close to all that is weighing on me.

Now I am just so tired and hopeless I don't know how to get the energy to try again. Any encouragement or wisdom the read / you can provide is very much appreciated. If you need to something that is hurtful please don't respond to this."
dsf,"I am in a state of emptiness. Recently, I was in a relationship with someone who didn't love me, but I loved them intensely. I had hoped eventually she would turn around, but for that time, I found deep meaning in her. Now it's over, and she doesn't seem to care. Meanwhile, I am in hell. It's like the past four years of my life were just a dream. I feel humiliated, used and defeated. I feel like I have nothing. I lost my job, stopped going to school, and was forced to move back in with my parents. I feel like a total failure and completely worthless. I feel like I am being punished by God, and there is no way out. Even in my dreams I can't escape the pain. I can't see the good in anything anymore. Everywhere, I see pain and suffering, with no hope. Even when I meet incredible people who am in awe of, I feel almost envious, knowing that I am a worthless, useless nothing in the presence of angels. I still have some friends, but have grown distant from them. Seeing their success, no matter how minute, just reminds me of my worthlessness. I have nothing to offer the world. I am without purpose.

Even when I have enough things to distract me, my ex is still in my dreams or nightmares every night. Before I met her, I got my life on track, was kicking ass in school, and headed for something. I know I can't blame her, but I just feel so stupid for getting caught up in her drama for no reason. What a waste.

I don't know. I've been reflecting on my life a lot. I'm 27 and have nothing to show for it. I feel like I have to make drastic changes. Liquor and drugs are not doing me any good. I don't know what the hell I want anymore. I'm so lost, sometimes I don't even know if I'm really alive.

I feel like right now, I have to settle for mediocrity and hope for simple low - stress job that pays the bills, but I don't have any source of joy or anything really to look forward too.

I've pinpointed that the major source for depression and life problems as been my self-hatred. It manifests itself in many forms, including obsessive feelings of inadequacy and incompetence, paranoia, being overly - sensitive to criticism, feeling worthless, hopeless, and giving up too easy because of those feelings.

Where did all this self - hatred come from? I don't want to blame my parents at my age, but I know that how they treated me when I was younger affected me and it still lingers in my psyche. They always employed the shame approach to parenting. Anytime something happened, my father would curse at me, and lecture me on how worthless I was. He would glare at me, and I just had to sit there and listen. Sometimes I would start crying, and then he would yell at me for crying, and say shit like ""look at you, you're not even ashamed."" Shame was apparently a virtue. My mother once told me when I was 8 that she wanted to have a third child, but because I was such a disappointment, she decided against it. They hit me frequently, with a bamboo stick. I remember they would constantly compare me to their friend's children, praising them and ask me why I couldn't be more like them.

So all this happened, but I can't change the past. I don't want to dwell and blame my parents for their mistakes, no one is a perfect parent. I just want to get over these feelings of self - hatred and get my life in order. I've identified the source of my depression, but haven't been able to change all those feelings and thought-processes that have been ingrained in me since early childhood. Does anyone have any advice on how to overcome these feelings, and gain a sense of confidence and direction back?"
dsf,"I am 30 years old and have lived with depression/dysthymia my whole life. I am going on one year of marriage to the most wonderful man ever. I've always wanted children until recently. I'm going through yet another depressive spell where I can barely function and come home after a high-powered job with headaches and complete mental exhaustion. I barely have enough for me, and even less for my husband! How could I handle a baby? It's pretty much inevitable I will have post-partum. When I thought about adoption I realized that I'd still be primary caretaker for a child and what if I can't be ""there"" for the child? I am SO ANGRY that this ""condition"" hinders so much in my life. Anyone else struggle with this?"
dsf,"When I was twelve, one of my younger sisters got leukemia. Despite my failing memory I can still remember a lot of what happened back then. I can remember being picked up at the park where I was playing to rush to the hospital where my sister had been getting tested. You could say I was whisked away from my innocence, but you're pretentious and I'm not. I can remember how my mother broke the news to me. And how her voice cracked a little when I asked how bad she had it. I can remember sitting in the front room of my grandparent's place, where I was staying so my parents could be with my sister in hospital, speaking to my cousin and saying that I felt it was somehow my fault. What followed was roughly a year of total disruption. My sister became the focus, understandably, while the rest of us learned to cope with the cloud hanging over us. Where a small rise in temperature could send hearts racing. But that has mostly been forgotten. Not blocked away, just forgotten. It was another age and doesn't feel real anymore. In the past few months the hospital has been doing a study of ex-patients and their families. Tonight it was my turn to do the phone interview. I'd been avoiding it, mostly because I'm lazy and I only ever seem to do things that I feel will be enjoyable to me. Anyway, so they called through and I spoke. I don't think there were really any surprises, although it was bizarre when I became conscious to the fact that I occurred to her getting cancer as it or that. I think I only said cancer once in the entire interview. Does that mean I'm crazy? Struggling to cope? I don't know. Of the questions they asked, I don't think I answered any that would cause a worry."
dsf,"Hi, everyone - new to these forum board thingies so please forgive me if this does not end up being posted in the right place! I have lived with depression since I was 14 years old (I am now 43). For the past 10 years I have been managing this condition without the aid of drugs or stimulants. My life changed the day I stopped fighting the ""condition"" and accepted it as part of who I was. Acceptance is the greatest gift you can give yourself on the road to recovery, not only does it take away the stigma, it also gives the fear nothing to feed on. For those of you who are still in the depths of darkness, please don't give up hope, there are many of us out here who, have experienced exactly what you are going through now, we survived - so can you. Recovery is possible, it just takes time and a little faith in yourself. Thank you for allowing me to join this community, I hope my experiences of living with this condition can help others, the door to the email box is always open! Kindest regards to all"

I am alone every night and i'm tired of being alone ..... there is nothing here for me, no life.  I'm going to keep doing drugs and i hope i kill myself.  I'm sure my family cares, i know they do but they can't help me.  I don't want to see a doctor, i want to die.  I have no motivation, i can't concentrate in school.  I'm not planning on being around for a while.  I can't handle being alone anymore ..... my dad is always with his girlfriend .... all the time, i never spend any time with my mom or dad ..... it doesn't really matter now anyway, it's all too late."
dsf,"i need to examine my schedule so i start getting more than three hours of sleep a night. This will not work when school comes around. Next week already. one class, four days a week, five weeks, then I'm done forever. Bloody finally. Goals at hand: get rid of things i don't need/want, save money, clean the car out and wash him, talk to landlord about subleasing, investigate work opportunities, drag the cat tree upstairs, clean apartment. need to start getting rid of things in Wisconsin too. Hoping to make a few weekend trips so i can load up the car and bring stuff back here and take my time going through everything. i feel rushed. Bed now with a book for a few pages."
dsf,"Lately i have been having some very vivid story - like dreams, normally i can't follow my dreams because they switch too quickly. i had a dream where i took my grandmother's large knife and a permanent marker and wrote my signature on it. Then later my mother found out about what i had done and became so angry with what i had done, that she made me cry, and i actually woke up crying. Then later that day i took a nap and i dreamt that i was being seduced by Tom Cruise, (who had gained a lot of weight), and when things began to heat up i rejected him, and he became very angry at me. He then later came to the house where i was, and began trying to hurt me and the people around me (which was an older lady, a young boy and teenage girl). i could hear him saying ""just kill them"" and talking about how he was really embarrassed when i rejected him, and he could do so much better than me. i then proceeded to take the young boy into hiding, and while hiding we were found and the boy hurt Tom defensively, but in a very graphic manor. I can't understand why i'm having such negative dreams, why they are so vivid, and what they all mean!"
dsf,"I went to this meeting. It was for people who have depression. The leader said to me that I was so knowledgeable I should be well. I was very sick at the time.

Which went to show me I had knowledge but no wisdom. For years I knew this. I read all the books and nothing changed. I really felt like maybe I was on the wrong line of thought to get over the depression. Yet I did feel better. I thought my life isn't changing though.

I have so many hopes and dreams for my life and here I am sitting around wasting it. I still feel like that at times but then something bad happened and I didn't react to it. I didn't feel worse. Then someone did something stupid and I didn't yell at them. I went to a friend and asked if she thought I was getting better. Her answer was. Hell Yeah. You bother to talk to me now. It seems she was doing all the talking at one stage. I didn't know.

It's been 10 years since I first got depressed In all the tests on the computer it went from severe depression to moderate the other day I got mild depression. Ok today its back to moderate. I think the reason for this is that I'm nearly there with a thought process and I just can't get it. I'm kicking myself for it for being incompetent and those words from that woman came back you have all this knowledge you should be better. Do I need to go back and do some stuff on self esteem again? Is this what this is about. I look inside of me and see my self esteem has fallen apart again ......... and I mean again! How many times is this? 100? a 1000 times?

Why can't I work this out? I don't know what is wrong.

I think if she asked me now, I would tell her, I haven't got all the answers yet. Somehow I wished she was right. That with what I knew I could just be better.

I'm off to hit the books. :-/ Isn't depression ironic? You can feel bad about anything even a compliment.

By the way. I'm still procrastinating. It's better though. I think. Not that much though I have so much to do. OK that is wrong isn't it?

I'm heading to the quiet of my bedroom to study. I hope."
dsf,"If you don't want periods (or PMS) at all there is the 3 monthly injection - Depo-provera - in the UK. It doesn't work the same for everyone (like all medicines) but for me it stopped all periods and kept my depression down to such a level that I could function ""normally"". I stopped having the 1 week mood swings, 1 week misery, 1 week mood swings, 1 week ok cycle. If that's not an option for you there is a herb supplement that I tried called Agnus Castus. It seems to have beneficial effects for most ""women's problems"" from aching breasts to full blown menopause. And it can have the side effect of weight loss (not a bad thing for me ) I was on it for ten years at a time and got to the stage where when I came off it and had a period again I had completely forgotten what they were really like! And things have wings now. The PMS didn't cause my depression but it certainly didn't help it. Hope this is helpful"
dsf,"Well, I've never cut before ... I've been tempted, but I'm so afraid that someone will notice and ask questions ... I don't want to talk about it ... Instead I hit my head against hard objects (walls, desks, tables), or I dig my nails into my skin, or sometimes I bite my lips or my arms hard until they leave marks, but nothing permanent, in case someone were to notice ... I don't bang my head as much any more, but sometimes I want to ... I want to hurt myself and I don't know why, it just pops into my head ... anyone else do and / or feel similar things??"
dsf,"Hi everybody! I'm new here and I want to tell my story in brief and ask you a few questions. I'm 27 now. Female. I'm studying on PhD in one of the US universities. I've been suffering from different kinds of psychological problems (mainly, depression) for 7 years already. I always tried to handle my depression by myself. And only once, when depression became unbearable, I went to psychiatrist. I had therapy and AD for a few months. That was about 5-51/2 years ago. Now I have strong depression again. I feel that I can't handle it by myself and that I'm tired of fighting it on my own. That's why I've scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist. My questions: 1. I feel that this depression is different from depressions I experienced before :I started to masturbate like crazy (4-5 times a day) and can't stop - it has been like this for a few weeks already and I seriously started to think about involving  in some homosexual relationship (which I've never done before). I also started to read a lot of porno stories. 2. I'm thinking almost constantly about suicide. I mean, I don't think about committing suicide. NO. I WANT TO LIVE. It's kind of obsessive thought playing in my mind: ""I feel bad ...suicide...many people do that...suicide"". It's kind of always in my mind. Sometimes I even have a feeling of the rope on my neck (I don't think about other kinds of suicide which is, probably, explained by the fact that my father hung himself). 3. Where am I going guys? Am I going to some serious psycho disease or what? Am I still normal (I feel like I'm still normal). Have you ever experienced something like this? Honestly, what I'm afraid of is that at some point I might start seriously consider these suicidal thoughts. I think this is what happened to my dad. 4. I've been here, in the US, only for 1 year. So, I don't know how the system works. If I come to a psychiatrist and tell her that I have these ""suicidal"" thoughts will she make me to be in the hospital (I hate even think about this). Should I even tell her about that? Should I be very honest and open? When I went to our University Health Center to get a referral form, I didn't say anything about that. So, I'm a bit afraid of trusting a psychiatrist. Maybe, I don't need to tell her everything. What would be your advice? I'd greatly appreciate your help. Thanks."
dsf,I'm 19 an architectural student life's meant to be all great right? everything in my life is so good but I'm always depressed and sometimes i go throw these stages where i cry out of nowhere for no particular reason! i used to cut myself and i really need to but my insecurities about my scars are holding me back i need to find happiness soon or I'm just going to give up on life I'm thinking way too far into the danger zone and almost suicidal! great here i go again bloody crying! well I'm just looking for some around my age who can relate and who i can talk to! and I'm a great listener so if there's anyone out there?
dsf,"I've had quite a few life situations that have probably contributed to depression.1. I grew up in an emotionally/sexually abusive family...but the type of abuse that is just over the line enough to mess with your head, to make you wonder if it was really abusive or if you were just sensitive. I still talk to them and see them at times, but vast quantities of things go unsaid. 2. I left home for college, and almost immediately was recruited into a religious cult where I stayed for 14 or so years; I just got out a couple of years ago. 3. I had my first major depressive episode while inside and although I found a supportive therapist, she too was in the cult and therefore some of her advice at times was influenced by their beliefs. Also I was alternately shunned and ostracized, rebuked harshly, or encouraged to give up medicines/therapy by various members in various levels of leadership in the cult. 4. I very recently switched jobs to a much better job situation, but am still adjusting the environment. 5. We're in contract to purchase a home, which is great, but also an adjustment. The Question. My psychiatrist thinks I've been depressed for most of my life. Which makes sense when I look back over my journals and look at various things I did, said or experience. Thing is, to me, depression as a state of mind became normal. I didn't know anything different than how I was feeling. So what happens is this: I mention something I've been experiencing to my therapist. She is concerned and asks if I've brought it up to my psychiatrist. When I do bring it up to my psychiatrist, he says, ""Why didn't you mention this before?"" To which my response is: I didn't know I should. Translation: I thought it was normal. Right now I'm on Effexor, with Adderall XR as a booster plus synthroid due to a nasty run in with lithium. When I started I was okay. Great even, minus the utter exhaustion at the end of every day. Lately though I've been feeling...things...that I can't describe. Sadness...but a feeling bigger and diverse than the word ""sadness"" can contain. Tired...but a ""tired"" with an emotional component. Feelings I don't have words for, but that pierce me to the bone. And that are not connected with anything in real time that I can think of. Is this normal? Deep strong feelings that surface out of nowhere for a time and then dissipate...usually on the weekends when I don't have work to focus on? Not feeling much of anything in between those times? Being vibrant and full of ideas yet calm and productive first thing after I take the medicines, but gradually fading to sort of numb, definitely tired, somewhat negative by the afternoon with exhausted, sink into the couch with the remote, hit the bed for a nap by 7:30, sometimes 6pm? How do you know what's ""normal"" if abnormal has been normal for you for so long? How do you know when it's time to have a sit down with the psychiatrist again?"
dsf,"I have been recently released from the hospital after a failed suicide attempt.  I am trying to learn how to cope with things and I recently found out that my wife has disclosed the fact that I attempted suicide to many people (about 8) that I really do not know, nor do I feel comfortable with them knowing.  As a matter of fact, I'm very upset about this.

For a little background my wife and i have not had the best relationship for the past 2 - 3 years.  about 18 months ago we moved back to her hometown after I lost my job and she could advance in her career where we are now.  I really don't have any friends down here and have lost contact with my old friends.

I have told 3 people that I attempted suicide (mom, dad, brother) and i knew that her family knew (mom, dad, 2 sisters)  Now my wife tells me that she needed to deal with what I have done and she has told many of her coworkers.  She couldn't talk about this with her family or with her high school friends (which are still in the area, and I have known about 8 years).  She had to tell people that she knows I don't know very well, and of what I do know, I don't like very much.  Now my wife wants me to do more things with her coworkers and I feel very uncomfortable around them.

Am I being too sensitive about this?  Not realizing my wife's needs?  Or am I justified in my being upset?

I will not be able to come back to this board until Monday (tomorrow) evening so I can't post any replies until then."
dsf,"All I am on this earth for is to die. What is so great about living. Everyone is going to die eventually. Why wait? Just get it over with. If god is so fucking great then why does he put humans on the earth that feel lost, sad, lonely, depressed, and worthless? Why do we all feel this way if god is wonderful? FUCK GOD! We're all in this world to eventually die. I want out. I hate the world, i hate myself, i hate the sun, i hate the moon, i hate everyone i know, i hate hating, but worst of all i hate love. when i love someone why don't they love me back? when i trust someone why must they lie to me? WHY?!?!?! Why is the world the way it is? why am i the way i am? Why are there so many worthless, hopeless, depressed people in the world that they have to make web sites?? Why is this the only way and the only time i can ever share my feeling? Why am i depressed? Do you want to know? ............... because i got raped and abused for 8 years. because i had my childhood taken away from me by a person that i trusted my life with, by the person that i called my father. My step dad raped me for 8 years, since i was 8 years old until a few months ago. Why didn't i tell anyone? why couldn't i speak up? ..... because he told me they wouldn't believe me, it would ruin the family. my mom would hate me. well he was right about one thing it did ruin the family, but they did believe me and my mom still loves me. it ruined the family for a better cause. i don't ever have to see or talk to my step dad ever again. so why do i still feel this way?. ...... because my mom still loves him, she is torn between us and she never really took my side and helped me through this. For 8 years of my life i had to pretend to be happy and normal. i had to push everything in the back off my mind and cry every night. i had to wonder why he was doing this to me, i thought he loved me. He had been my father since i was 2. how could he betray me like this and hurt me. how could he take away my childhood. from that i learned that in the end everything will be bad and nothing is ever what it seems. I had to grow up so fast, i had to realize how the world really was. i had to lie and keep secrets. I learned to hide everything even myself, even my soul. It took me 8 years of pain and suffering. of growing, thinking and knowing. of wishing, hoping and dreaming. to finally speak up. To finally show myself. to make my soul vulnerable. To cry a million tears that i could never cry before. but now that i can be me and show myself, i don't like myself. All the pain and misery. the secrets and lies. the memories and nightmares. this all was building up inside of me for 8 years. Now its showing and I'm a bitter and sad person. I was on the verge of exploding and now its taking me along time to get all this build up out of me. I've never really discovered who i really am. I pretended for 8 years and now all the hurt and bitterness is showing. When and if that's all gone what will i really be like? i can't even picture myself being happy or excited. I can't picture my self in color when everything around me including me is gray and bleak. Will anyone ever love me? I try to love people but they always hurt me and i know that it will always be that way ......................................................."
dsf,"Besides the issue with the jealousy which is probably related to this thread there are other things which you all may or may not relate to. i'm 24 years old but am feeling a huge burden to accomplish things from my boyfriend, parents and society in general. Not to say that i don't want to accomplish things ... i most definitely do thing is that i am not sure what area i should be focusing on. i'm in school currently for dancing and though i feel competitive i'm losing focus once again. i get bored easily and always want to try new things. which makes it impossible to advance at any one thing. i also enjoy writing and singing. i love singing actually but am not sure what or how to do anything with it. while some expect me to use my college degree to get a regular job ... which i'm starting to think is what i should do, others think i should waitress and do what it takes to advance creatively. all in all i am stuck. i am on my spring break and am doing nothing, i need a job and though i feel i need to go out and do something, i'm really depressed. how can i get out of this rut i'm in. and actually start doing things when i'm not even sure what it is i want to do?"
dsf,"I’m New to this site, I was diagnosed with SLE Lupus about eight months ago and i'm on very strong treatment using predinsone. Everyone around me noticed it first I guess since I was suddenly so quiet, moody and would cry at the drop of a hat. Which, was so unlikely of me I used to crack jokes laugh and my goal was always to have fun and make other's laugh. But since my diagnosis and medications (which I counted and i'm taking like almost 100 pills a week and I just turned 22 yesterday, honestly i'd never thought i'd be in this state at 22 a few years ago) 
Anyway I never wanted to admit it, depression is not only a symptom of lupus but it's a side effect of the medication as well, and I think that it's a general first reaction to being told that you have an incurable disease. But I finally am starting to see it now I think that i'm really depressed.

I was never a quiet girl but now i'm so quiet that I think i'm scaring everyone.

but now i'm living with my wonderful boyfriend who seems to understand everything so well and is so patient with me. But I just need a place where I can talk this out with people who understand."
dsf,"My name is Maria, I'm 37 and have social anxiety plus some traits of borderline personality disorder.  I've been taking Prozac for the last eight years and have been seeing a psychiatrist that whole time.  Next week I have an appointment with a therapist (I have only had random therapy sessions during this time).

What I'm really struggling with right now is how I am still single after all these years.  I'll go out with someone about a half a dozen times and then they lose interest, or as the last person said, I freaked him out (really I think he overreacted to a couple of incidents, but I guess if he was freaked out, who am I to argue?)  In 2002 my best friend / ex died in my condo from years of drug / alcohol abuse ... he was going through a rough period at the time, but I really think we would have ended up together .... since then I have had a hard time connecting with anyone else on the same level.

Does anyone else find that people they date are scared off?  Every time someone breaks it off with me, I get very discouraged and that much more ""jaded"" ... with this last person, I even took a day off from work.  Anyone else go through this?"
dsf,"I am screaming inside. I want to cry. My eyes are burning, ready to cry. At least it's something... A feeling. It has taken me so much time to work up the courage to call a psychiatrist. I told myself no matter how I am feeling I am going to call. I researched and found who's supposed to be the best. I called and was referred to a local chapter; not taking new patients. They referred me to a place where the psychiatrist isn't taking new patients but the psychologists are. They asked me what kind of treatment I needed!! ""Do you need a therapist or do you need a psychiatrist"" All of this was after I worked so hard explaining my life long depression with and without circumstantial reasons. I AM NOT THE DOCTOR. HOW DO I KNOW WHAT I NEED!! BOTH!!! I set the appt, but I think I need access to both a therapist and a psychiatrist. I canceled, and I feel so horrible. Don't they know how hard it was for me to call? I am upset right now. I want to give up, but I know I will have to call someone else. Why does it have to be so hard?"
dsf,"What am I afraid of? That is an interesting and deadly question. If analyzed too casually it can pull you into a never-ending pit of distain for oneself, if your mind is agreeable to self-distain. My mind, it seems, has always been agreeable to self-doubt and self-deprecation. I, it must be pointed out, am not fond of such thinking and countless hours, days, weeks, in fact years have been spent struggling against this susceptibility in my mind to dwindle everything down to its most melancholy conclusion. It is not a trait I accept or a trait I allow, but is merely the default setting of my mind. To avoid this thinking is to fight against one's natural order. Is this true? I have often hoped not, and certainly many have theorized that this could change with much effort and self-improvement. Ah, yet it is a tricky beast, this black hole that sucks the energy in my mind, even the positive thought can be twisted and turned into something ugly, a sort of distorted, aching false happiness that becomes as detrimental as the illness it is meant to cure. Our lady of perpetual doubt thrives in false hope. Yet, without hope men like me do not survive. Without hope to succeed is hopeless. And although success hasn't been abundant in my life, the little that can be found in its history was certainly built on a foundation of hope and moderate self-belief. This is gobbledygook, mental masturbation, which has no readership value in the least. I am just spouting thoughts, but some of those thoughts have an eerie connection with the truth of the last 17-and-a-half years. Oh, if I could only breath the air that filled my lungs the days before my brain melted down. I know life felt differently. I wasn't the happiest of children, maybe already bent towards self-destruction or depression, but I breathed freer air. Life definitely had a different feeling, a different perception. It was much different. For a while, as a teenager, I could still recall how that felt. Not in feeling, but in memory. Now the memory is all but completely lost. All I know now is that it changed when I was 13, and despite all my growth and lifting out of this disease, it was never meant to return, that freedom. Funny, how I thought when I was 13. Despite the pain, I thought it would be all over soon. I remember thinking that in a couple years I wouldn't even remember the putrid mental stink that was skewing my vision of the world around me. I would get over it. Something would happen and this dark pit would be left behind and forgotten. The dark pit is still here. I am managing, better than most I imagine, but the horrid thing is still here. I am not sure if it ever could truly lose itself. Just its memory could insight its existence. I would have been better if it had not been born at all. Too late, it is a part of me now. A part of my history, a part of my present. My unwelcome capture."
dsf,"I have so much pent up anger that I carry around with me all the time. It seems as though it's about 4 years old and it's now catching up to me. And I'm telling people off left and right. I will honestly admit, I talk a lot of shit and in the end people somehow walk all over me. Well, not any more and not this time. I always have a string of bad luck and tonight was no different when I was at brooks picking up some medications and the cashier slammed my change down and threw my slip at me. I told her off then formally complained about her. And you know something? It felt damn good, defending myself.

I've only been with two girls while in middle school but that's it.  i think some guys are cute and all but i just get really uncomfortable. my psychiatrist thinks i have some repressed memory   but i don't know what to do about it. i always clog up whenever i want to tell someone something important  i have this fear that they wont care or will tell someone else. my family has a huge problem with that and I've known too many deceitful people to trust anyone  so if you have any ideas to what i should do please tell me"

sorry for going on but that's me"
dsf,"I am new here today. I believe I have been suffering from depression since I was a late teen. I am now 42, run my own business and just started Prozac late December & seeing a psychologist in late Nov. I do not feel any better but it is a relief just knowing that you are doing something other than trying to ignore a definite but unexplainable problem. I suffer from severe anxiety, fall asleep fine but wake up at 2.00 am with my mind racing a million miles a minute, mostly about work. This anxiety and depression has definitely affected my relationship with my wife & kids. Most times when you're at work you want to be home & vice versa, really don't know what you want. I do not feel like talking to anyone & have cut off most of my good friends. I understand most men do not want to admit they have a problem until their wife leaves them and it's too late. I am happy that is not the case with me. I just hope the medication kicks in soon so I can see what it feels like to be normal if that is possible. Thanks for letting me ramble"
dsf,"I've realized that I made a big mistake by starting this blog. It serves no purpose to put feelings out for public view, so I've deleted the entries from the last six months. I was going to explain some things, but thought better of it. I think a small part of my old self has awakened again. I'm a bit ashamed of all the whining I've done here. I'm embarrassed that I've sought out people in my life for emotional support when I should have dealt with things privately, on my own. When I lost my mind to grief, I forgot everything that I knew. As the old adage goes: you come into this world alone, you live alone, you die alone. You solve your problems alone, needs to be added. The intense pain of grief can warp your mind, impair your judgment and make you do foolish things that you will later regret. I'm sorry if I've upset anyone, but my intention was simply an attempt at self-help, not to change the world. I was simply searching for a way to try to deal with and escape from this pain. I've always appreciated the supportive comments left by people and I thought I had expressed that before. I never thought anyone had an expectation that I would contact them or would even really want me to contact them. I am after all, a stranger to those who have read my words. I was getting to the point where I was starting to  consider emailing some of the people who have posted comments, just to thank them, but now I think that it's better that I don't. This is the old, public version of me writing to day.  I've pushed most of the real, troubled me back down into a box for a little while. I've resolved only to let her out when I'm alone. In this blog, I did dwell on many of the same things again and again, but I was surprised that I could actually find some release by repeatedly talking about the same thing. I think this will be my last entry, so goodbye and good luck."
dsf,"I'm sort of new... Here is the short version: I'm 26 year old man. Single. No kids. I live in Arizona (USA). My father was a workaholic, and an alcoholic. So usually he wasn't present, and when he was he was abusive. In addition, mental illness runs in my family. At the age of 5 I was sexually molested by a neighbor. I can recall my anxiety always being there. It's something I have always fought with especially in social situations. My family completely isolated me when I was growing up, in the name of protecting me. As a result I never really learned social skills until I was older. I grew up being abused by my peers throughout school. Found myself taken in by the only people who would accept me as I was: the misfits, outcasts, drug-users. Early into my teen years depression came as an addition to my anxiety. Around 16 I started to get into substance abuse. The only thing I ever used was LSD on weekends regularly. A year later this extended into ecstasy and LSD. I had a traumatic experience and stopped using anything about a year after that. My anxiety became so overwhelming I could not function. So at this time I first started seeing a counselor and a psychiatrist. They put me on Clonzepam. My last year in high school my father was starting to lose it so my mother asked me to leave so we didn't kill each other. I had an inheritance from another relative and I lived off that. I went 2 whole years without speaking to my father. I sunk deep into depression, and returned to substance abuse. The Clonzepam wasn't working anymore. After being outcast from my family, I went full on into the dark side. What was just LSD and ecstasy usage branched into cocaine, meth, marijuana, and virtually anything my friends and I could find. This culminated in an extreme suicide attempt about a year out of high school. After getting out of the mental hospital, I went totally straight and haven't touched any drugs since then. The 8 years following have been a rollercoaster. One moment being on top of the world, having everything I could ever want. Another losing everything. Several long horrible relationships occurred in this time. Over the years my doctor has moved me around on various medicines. I have been using Effexor since 1998. Currenlty I take Lamictal in addition to it. I suffer from chronic reoccurring depression, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder."
dsf,"Hello everyone. I'm here because I'm starting to have doubts about my mental health... First off I'm a 21 year old male college student, and up until about 2 years ago I think I've been fine...but lately I'm not so sure. For one thing I can't seem to concentrate or focus on ANYTHING anymore and it's becoming very frustrating. I find myself daydreaming or pacing only minutes after I sat down to do something important and because of it I can't get anything done. I can't even focus on things that should be fun, or the things I used to be dedicated too. I've also become very philosophical. I always find myself spending a lot of time thinking about life and death, the nature of existence, etc...But it seems like its becoming an obsession. I always feel like I'm wasting time but I can't bring myself to do anything constructive. Sometimes I'm disgusted when I realize how much time I spend simply pacing back and forth. I also can't fall asleep at night anymore...I just lie awake thinking and I can't make it stop. I also have constant fears about becoming old and having regrets about how I lived and what I accomplished. I also have constant regrets about the past. It seems like there's nothing I can do in life to satisfy myself and it driving me crazy...especially because for all the ambition I have I have no motivation whatsoever anymore. Also it's hard to explain, but I get the feeling that I can't feel life, if that makes any sense? It's like time is moving so fast that I can't even realize it.  Anyway, I was never like this before and I have no reason to be like this now. I don't have relationship problems or family problems and I'm not religious. This all just came out of nowhere with no apparent cause. Basically it has come to the point where I know something is wrong with me but I don't know what. I've kept telling myself this is nothing but its getting more intense and now I feel like I'm spiraling into a void or something. I guess I'm simply here to seek some opinions on what my problem could be. Thanks a lot for taking the time. PS I may have posted this in the wrong place but its my first post so I'm not sure..."
dsf,"I think I may have been on this forum (it looked different) back in 2002 when I had a major bout with depression and anxiety due to some serious financial worries. I've always been prone to this I guess, but I'm starting to figure out that it's big, nasty life-changes that trigger it. Well, here I go again. This time it's relationship-related. My wife and I are on brink of divorce. I found out almost a year ago that she has been emotionally involved with another man, and was no longer ""in-love"" with me. We somehow muddled through the next several months, even though I found out it was still going on, we kept ""trying"" anyway, and things were still tolerable and ok, I guess. (We still shared same bed, got affectionate, cuddled and even made love). About 3 weeks ago, I discovered that it still had not ended, and they were actually conspiring on getting together in March. Well, all hell broke loose and things got worse than ever. I'm now in a separate room, sleeping on a single bed, and I'm miserable. I resumed Wellbutrin when this all started last spring (I took Wellbutrin for about 9 months when I had my episode in 2002), and have been taking it since. But since this really bad turn of events, I knew I couldn't take it, and to be honest, even before I discovered again, my therapist told me that I need to revisit my doctor and prescriptions because I've got some serious anxiety issues. So now I just started Zoloft (25mg/day) in addition to the Wellbutrin. I don't know how things are going to turn out. I'm in ""limbo"" while I give her ""time and space to figure things out."" The Zoloft I think started to kick in today, but not in a good way. I'm actually feeling MORE depressed when I came in this morning...I almost broke down crying in front of my computer -argh! My mood swings are horrible. All I can think about is going home and crawling into my bed and taking an Ambien, even though I hate that bed and want to be in the big bed with my wife. I almost wish at times that she would just say, ""That's it, we're done"", so I can know what is going on and just move on with my life. I may end up single and lonely anyway, but at least I'll have the opportunity to look for someone else. Right now I feel like a prisoner, being starved of basic human needs, like hugs, touches, affection. (Doesn't that sound lame from a guy???????  ) Well, anyway, here I am....here for the ride...."
dsf,"I'm new to the forum and just wanted to say Hi to everyone My depression stems from my husband and his secretive actions and cheating. I love my husband we have been together for 16 years and have 2 children together. He went to Thailand with his dad last year to visit his brother who lives over there working as a teacher, but before he left he found this website forum owned by a bar owner there who uses bar girl prostitutes as waitresses. To make this long story short he went with one of these bar girls while he was there and it took my children to find out the truth because I was too stupid to find out myself lol One found pictures of her in his organizer and the other found text messages on his cell phone. I should have known something was up as he never leaves his cell phone on anymore when at home anymore since he came back. He sits on that forum when at work and also at home all the men on that forum talk about the bargirls and post pictures of them also. My daughter sent a text message to the woman and she said a lot of hurtful things to her, I was worried for a few days that my husband would find out she was contacted and blame me. We also found pills he has been taking that he got from India called tadalasil which is a form of viagra, as far as I know he never had a problem sexually so why is he taking these pills? who knows lol My cousin called me a couple of days ago and said he posted a message on that forum saying he wants to go back to thailand again and what excuse could he give me for wanting to go, she said he also said that he posted he doesn't want to cheat on me just fuck other women when I'm not around. She checks the forum for me as I don't want to see it but it hurts just as bad when someone tells you what he puts. He doesn't have any friends really here where we are because all he does is works so I don't know if the men on the forum are substitutes for real friends and he is putting what they would find interesting or what. I don't drive and we live out in a rural area with no real neighbors so I don't get into town barely and I don't have many real friends here as we moved here to do some job work. So that saying LIFE SUCKS really seems to fit lately lol
My concern lately is sex transferred diseases such as AIDS as I found out that thailand is known as a sex trade country and many have the disease. Prostitution is illegal there but they allow businesses to operate like that bar due to the money the male tourists bring there. The government is going to give asia and africa millions of dollars to help research AIDS but they are not going to make Thailand help stop the spread of the disease by shutting down places that promote prostitution, they worry about bird flu or about people carrying weapons onto planes but they don't care if men bring a silent killer like AIDS back into our country and infect their spouses or lovers. Do I sound crazy? because sometimes I feel I am going crazy lol
I'm sorry for rambling on but I have held this in for months, scared to talk to him as i love him with all my heart even if others say I'm an idiot and scared to talk family and friends anymore about it because it hurts to much."
dsf,"Driving back home from dropping my cousins off, I began to think about my future actions. I'm fully committed to this. I know that when I start, there's no going back. If I don't succeed, if this becomes a botched suicide attempt, there really will be no life after that. My parents will hate me. My friends will leave me or treat me with kid gloves. Either way, I suffer even more than I suffer now. It doesn't seem possible that my suffering can grow but I know that if I don't continue or succeed, it will. I honest to goodness don't know what's wrong with me. I mean, why do I have to feel like this? Nothing I've done to make things right with myself has helped. Things just keep getting worse for me. Before, I let it go because I understood that the bad needs to happen before the good. That you have to have the bad with the good. I kept on waiting for the good. I didn't expect sunshine and rainbows but I expected some sort of light, even a tiny bit. I expected a slight reprieve from the evil, dark thoughts swirling in my mind. No. Everything just seemed to worsen with time, with me. They say that time heals all wounds but time has just worsened mine."
dsf,"First I want to introduce myself, I live in Arkansas I am 39 and a mom to 4 (18, 15, 8 and 3) I have been on and off different antidepressants for almost 4 years. Started out with celexa after I had my last baby, went through some ppd and haven't been the same since. I was on celexa for 14 months then stopped for 7 months, then went back on it and totally had a bad reaction. Then came zoloft, that lasted about 3 months sent me in to some sort of mania, then there was wellbutrin, wanted to drive off the road in to the lake on that, then came effexor which I thought worked but apparently I also was going through rapid cycling, I kind of liked that. I spent 3 months on that and about a month on the wellbutrin. Then came paxil cr, was on that for 6 months but I just cant get past these mood swings and outbursts. So now I have been on Lexapro for almost 3 months, today the doctor decided to increase me to 20 mg and add lamictal for my mood swings. I am a little nervous about starting this new one. This rash I hear about sounds scary. I also take 1 mg of klonopin as needed(everyday)
I just wonder if I will ever feel the same again, but then it has been so long that I don't know if I would even know what that feels like. Sorry to ramble on, but that's my story. I am to start the lamictal tonight. wish me luck!!
If anyone has any input for me I would really appreciate it"
dsf,"I don't know what's wrong with me. I have always had depression, and in the past thought of suicide. I got over the suicide idea mostly, but now I'm worried i might have something severe. My dad brought up Multiple sclerosis, and it's worried me ever since. i have a few symptoms of ms, such as fatigue, cognitive problems, and muscle twitches. all the other symptoms i don't really have, and fatigue and cognitive problems can be from depression i believe. well, anyways, i keep getting worried about it, and i started getting scared (anxiety?) and i cant sleep. then right when i just start sleeping, my legs or arms twitch, waking me up abruptly. i would go see a doctor, but i have no medical coverage, and no job.

could this ms idea just be mental, turning into a physical problem with my limbs moving right when i start falling asleep? i do know, when i start falling asleep, i start dreaming then i suddenly move the limb i move in the dream. but also, i don't need to be almost asleep and my arm or leg will move slightly."
dsf,"I am a 26 year old married mother of three boys. I was recently diagnosed as having depression. I have noticed it getting a lot worse in just the past week. At first I thought to myself I don't have anything to be depressed about but the more I thought about it the more I realized what it was. Me and my husband used to spend time with our kids and go out and do things on Fridays or the weekends. I can't remember the last time we just went to Walmart as a family for no reason other than to go. My husband doesn't understand what the effect of him not spending that time with me and us has had on me. Just like tonight instead of asking me and the boys to run to town with him, his friend went. I don't care if he is only going for an hour that's an hour we could have his time. I cry all the time when he's not here just because I miss my husband. I'm 26 we should have a healthy active life with our kids but instead I work and come home, and on my days off I sit at home with my kids. When he is off he stays at home. He works and then him and his friend if they get off early go places in town and then he comes home. I don't get to do that. I can't remember the last time I just went window shopping, just running around. My thoughts about not being around have gotten worse and that terrifies me. How can I get my husband to understand that him spending time with me would help this so much. He just thinks it's a joke and that's one reason I think he wouldn't miss me if I'm gone except he would have to find another maid."
dsf,"I'm new here - wasn't quite sure where to start but ""special new member posting area"" seemed appropriate. I think I've been battling depression off and on for some time now. I saw a therapist briefly, for a couple months, but had to stop when it got too expensive and when I couldn't take the time off work anymore. I actually didn't even start seeing her until the worst of my depression had already passed. Not sure I got that much out of it, but maybe I didn't give it enough time. I was doing so well for a while, but in the last week or two, I can feel myself sliding back into it. There are certain things, issues, that tend to pull me into that hole. I'd done so well at avoiding them, I felt like I was over it. But I'm dwelling on them again, and I don't know what to do this time to break the hold. The smallest thing sets me off crying, and I've completely lost interest in the things I was so excited about two weeks ago, along with most everything else. I feel completely isolated - I have no one to talk to about this, which I guess is why I'm here online. OK not sure what the point of this post was, but thanks for letting me get it out. Sometimes it feels better just to tell someone, anyone."
dsf,"Well I'm 13 so please excuse my grammar and spelling. Well it started almost about... 1.3 yr ago. I started to get large mood swings and would end up being sad or feeling guilty nearly everyday. That's when i discovered cutting myself. It started off as what does it feel like then grew into and addiction. I used to be doing it nearly everyday. IT made/makes me feel like there's nothing wrong. Well this grew bigger and bigger and i didn't tell anyone about it. After about 8 months i started to lie to myself and say everything was fine, It worked. Only temporarily. Around 3 months ago the feelings came back and i still have them at this moment. I have researched a lot about clinical depression. I still cut and i hate it. I came right out to my parents and said ''Maybe i enjoy cutting myself"" when we were in a huge fight. My dad turned around and said ""we don't care if you cut yourself"". This definitely didn't help. So right now i have one person i can talk to about it and has a good friend of mine. I checked the symptoms of clinical depression on Answers.com and i have 12/13 of them. I need to go see a doctor i know but i just can't. There's something stopping me and i don't know what it is. I just want to solve it on my own but i can't. I need Help. I have also been thinking about committing suicide and doing drugs but my friends that know i cut are stopping me. I know i will be missed. I just can't live on anymore... I can't see myself living past 18. Can anyone relate to this? Can anyone help?"
dsf,"I'm losing my mind and don't know where to put it for safe keeping. If only I could just put it in a little box, wait for the insanity to subside and then take it out and it would be unharmed. Lately I feel as though I've been more crazy than usual. I can't stand human contact, not just from my wife, but from anyone, a handshake, a hug, anything. I just tense up and can't breathe. What the **** is wrong with me? Yet I lay in bed wanting her to hold me, but when she does, I can't breath, it has nothing to do with how she is cuddling up against me, it's just how I start to feel. I hate feeling like this because it makes her feel like she is less than desirable or that she did something wrong. She didn't. I still love her. I need her. I'd be dead w/o her that's for sure. The good doctor is on vacation this week, I may leave her a message about this latest 'issue' just because I know myself. I won't bring it up next time I see her and then it will continue to bother me. It's like I need to go in w/ a list pinned on my shirt of things I'd really like to talk about. Because I get there and I can't speak. And I hate the awkwardness of sitting there, staring into someone's eyes, knowing there are things you should be saying but you can't. I'll get over it. I always do. That's my motto and I'm believing it less and less lately. Oh well. Monday will be here in 10 min and I need to go to bed. See you tomorrow."
dsf,"new to the forum and just like to share my depression with you all.

I was verbally abused at school from the age of 9 right the way up until i left school, at the age of 10 i self - harmed because i felt worthless not wanted and thick. at the age of 13 my dad left, at the age of 15 i took cannabis to get me through school, people at school used to pick on me everyday ""for nothing"" i'd come home with tears dripping from my face go to my bedroom and cut myself with bits of glass. then at 16 the last year in school i used to get drunk before i went into school this helped me for a while it was the only thing i could rely on.

anyway i'm now 19 years old and have a list of problems such as: Social phobia / Mild Agoraphobia, Anxiety problems, Depression, Paranoia, Delusions and Insomnia ""what a list eh!!""

I don't want to play this sick board game we call life, i don't want anything from life it has nothing to offer me. i've lost count of all the times i have wanted to kill myself. I don't trust anyone i have no friends and i just want to be in total solitude.
Why can't people accept the fact i don't want to socialize? Why is that so wrong?
I want to die but i can't at the moment because that would hurt my Mom, i'm stuck on what to do i just want to be put out of my misery i cant see i future for me.

sorry for babbling on, i hope people reply talk soon"
dsf,"I'll first tell you what happened just in case no one read the previous posts about it.

well I went camping with a friend I didn't want to go and I hate her ..

I had a bit of alcohol and started passing out and my friend started touching me .. etc. I feel sick every time I see her and fail to face her anytime I know she's near.

I confided in my 2 closest friends but one of them don't understand at all. she says I have to face my fears when I see her in school and dread walking past her or near her. My friend doesn't realize that I feel physically sick and shaky when I'm near her.

I just can't explain to her that it's not a phobia like spiders or what ever she truly annoys me and I don't know what to do."
dsf,"Hi everyone I am new here. I guess I will start from the top with my story. At the age of 17 I was hospitalized for bipolar disorder which I do not think I have. Anyways I was hospitalized twice medicines worked for a while but then I would just crash down into a further depression. At the age of 18 I stopped all medicines because I was happy and didn't think they were really doing anything to help me. Since that time I still suffer occasional bouts of depression. I will also add in that my mom has schizoaffective disorder and that I have many aunts and uncles with depression. I am now soon to be 26 and I just feel very alone. I am married and I work and go to school right now. I am just overwhelmed I don't want to go to my classes I don't feel like it is worth my time I feel like no one cares if I succeed or fail. I have had these feelings before this is the same way I felt when I dropped out of high school. I just feel worthless the only thing I even enjoy anymore is work and lately that has not given me much enjoyment at all I use to be eager to be there and now I am anxious to get off of work and come home and not do anything. My husband and I have been fighting a lot lately he has an anger problem that we have been trying to work through, and it is negatively impacting the way I feel. I can also tell though that he is worried about me he keeps asking me if I am ok or if I am mad at him I just don't really feel anything right now I am just numb. I just have a million thoughts running through my head and no matter what I do I can't seem to get rid of the negativity. I am tired all the time, yet I can't sleep at night that well but I have been falling asleep in the middle of the afternoons. I overreact to little things and the list goes on. I know what can happen if I let this go on. I nearly lost my life to the negative thoughts when I was younger that is the only reason I got help then. I have decided to see my doctor and get some help I just think I need some support I have no friends around here well at least that have any time to visit and my family is all 2 hours away."
dsf,"I am 34 year old single mother in a weird relationship and living in a place I can't seem to adjust to and is very far from my home and my family.  I am broke, have hardly any job prospects, and do not own a car.  I do not get along with the father of my daughter and just got swindled by his lawyer so he does not ever have to pay child support (long story).  He's an ass!  I have had 2 abortions and 1 miscarriage in the last three years and am very regretful for them and can't seem to forgive myself.  My parents and I are not speaking due to my mother's alcoholism and my choice to move so far away.  My partner has recently decided he does not want to have any children, which was the straw on the camels back, and on my birthday I had a complete breakdown.  I have had depression for as long as I can remember, along with anxiety. 

Due to these events the last four years, I have just recently dived into the world of antidepressants.  I took Wellbutrin SR 300 mg for about 1 month and it does not seem to do much.  My doctor gave me Cymbalta 30 mg, and it also seems not to do too much.  Not sure if I can combine the two or not.  Does anyone know if you can?  They both decreased my appetite noticeably, but my energy level is still low and and I still feel a little anxious and depressed.  

Anyway, that's a little about me and my situation."
dsf,"I'm a 33 year old man with a history of depression (I was diagnosed when I was 10) and of ""standing apart"" -- not refusing to fit in out of some sense of rebellion, but not fitting in simply because I couldn't. I have never been married. I've had only one long term relationship -- it was long - distance and very turbulent for both my partner and I (the relationship ended three years ago). To this day I wonder why I don't ""measure up"", why I can't seem to find my place in life. While not physically stunning by any means, I never thought I was hideous, either -- though my looks have most often been pointed out to me as a shortcoming, so that's the explanation I tend to go with most of the time. When I hit my teenage years, panic disorder became a problem, too (as I realized how little control I had over my life and the way it was going to turn out).
At the beginning of each year, I stand back and take stock of my situation, asking myself: where am I right now? Which direction am I headed in from here? What are my options? Up until now, I could always find some reason to be at least a little hopeful, to keep going -- but this year I can't. I've been out of work for a long time, the panic attacks are getting bad again, I've had a number of relatively minor but still worrisome health problems in the last few months -- and worst of all, after so many years, I'm still alone. There are no prospects out there; no one wants to be with me.
I'm in a lot of pain and I don't know how to make it better. This is not just a temporary slump, it's my whole life, but it hurts even worse now than it used to."
dsf,"I am 30 years old and I've been living with depression as long as I can remember (I think it started when I was 10) . However I was diagnosed with major depression only 2 years ago. Since then I've experienced recurrent episodes of depression. I thought that knowing what was my problem, accepting it, taking medication, seeing a therapist, working on cognitive therapy, would make my life better. Unfortunately, I still have those major episodes of depression where I'm hopeless and sad, and the only solution available to stop the pain seems to kill myself. No fun in there.

I know that depression is part of who I am, I know it's part of my life and I accept it. What I cannot accept is the fact that it's not going to be easier. I need hope. I need to hear from people who have had recurring depression (not just on episode) and have been able to deal with it and are able to enjoy life.

Please tell me it's possible."
dsf,"Hi everyone. I am a 26 yrold mom of three, 6 and under. My depression started as a teenager, but somehow back then I was able to ""talk myself out of it"" and perhaps had enough going on to keep me distracted. I got married right after high school, and nine months later, (overnight, really) became a mom. I never intended to be a mom at nineteen. I had dreamed of going to college, enjoying years of freedom with my husband, and then, carefully ""planning"" our first child. Well, seven years later, we've planned only one (our last), and strangely enough my only planned child was the hardest to recover from emotionally. After the birth of my first child I struggled with denial over all my crushed dreams, and fought back depression and suicide on a daily basis. I saw a psychiatrist who put me on various medicines over the next few months, to no significant improvement. When my daughter was three months old I was voluntarily committed to a behavioral health facility and stayed there four days. I came out fully charged, and within a matter of days, was right back where I started. So I started seeing a therapist who did me little good, and continued on the latest medicine combination I was prescribed. Shortly after my daughter turned one I finally gave up on the medicines and the therapy and pretended to be better, even though I wasn't, because of the sheer frustration that nothing was ""helping"" so I might as well just get on with life. I continued to battle depression and suicide on a daily basis, and also struggled with behavior that was contrary to what a good mother should be. My husband was military, and it is during times in his absence that I have become ""her"", my alter ego, someone who is intolerant, impatient, selfish, and ugly towards my kids. And blah, blah, blah. Do you guys get tired of telling your life story, because I do. I've lost count of how many times I've told it to various therapists in some vain attempt to help them understand me. So let me tell you where I am now. I am a person who is deeply confused. On the one hand I dearly love my kids, my husband, and I have the desire to live life and see my children grow and strengthen my relationship with them and my husband. On the other hand, I am sapped of every last ounce of purpose, life becomes extremely monotonous, and I strain to see the point of it all. Even now, as I write this, I am wondering, ""why am I wasting my time? These people will never know one tenth of a percent of what is going on inside me."" And that is how I've left every therapy session I've ever gone to, feeling like my time was utterly wasted and like I've made a chicken scratch in an issue solid as ice and twenty feet deep. I balance on a fragile thread of life and death and I'm scared that it is only a matter of time before something tips the balance just far enough that I finally do ""it"". My biggest fear is that by the time I find a way to heal myself, if I make it that far, my kids will have paid the ultimate price and be a product of confusion and sadness too. I am sick and tired of trying to feel human. In talking with others, I feel intangible, fake, this intellect in human form but incapable of human understanding. My emotions are real; love, hate, empathy, grief, anger, happiness, but I still do not feel ""real"". I feel like I am missing some vital component that ties it all together, and without it, I am nothing more than this body walking around, emulating those around me, operating on some kind of autopilot. It goes beyond frustration and confusion, and I feel this pent up rage building inside of me, and I want to scream at the top of my lungs until I turn blue, throw a chair through a window, send dishes crashing to the floor, something through which I can channel the anger and get it as far from me as possible. And then, sorrow. Black as an abyss, tormenting hopelessness, and it is then that I contemplate suicide. Fortunately (or not) I will then remember something, some reason for why I can't do it. The other day was my sisters birthday. I didn't want her to have to remember her birthday as the day her sister killed herself. Then I bawl, because there is no way out. I can't leave, and staying means continued torment for me and the people I love, and for some reason, love me. How long must I endure this cycle? Once again I am off medication. After the birth of my third child I went on the latest wonder drug, Lexapro, and after a year with no improvement I've abandoned that as well. I also made another mental health check in when the baby (now 1 1/2) was a few months old, for six days in duration, and once again came out feeling like a hundred bucks only to crash again. I've examined the perspective that, like the books title, ""Depression is a Choice"", and have even embraced the idea. I've also embraced the idea that it is certainly not a choice, and that medication is the solution, with equally unhelpful results. I grow weary of this fruitless search to ""fix myself"". For those of you who would suggest God, yes I am a believer. I turned to him three years ago, after years of Agnosticism, in utter desperation to fill in the ""missing link"". But for whatever reason, He still isn't enough. Which is the biggest blow of all, because I truly comprehend the sacrifice that was made in my behalf with the Atonement, and yet for some reason fail to utilize it. So here I am. One big mess. And I'm joining the group, lucky you! See you around"
dsf,"Hi, I am new here and don't know where to start, where to post or anything. I don't know what can help me, but I know that I don't like my self, and I am unhappy most of the time. I am not currently on any medicines (can't even do that right) and have never really been tested or diagnosed with anything other than depression. I live my life day dreaming of what could be and what should be......I am a 38 year old female and my problems started when I was born. I was born to an alcoholic dad whom I loved and a mom who did the best she could whom I love as well. My whole family was in therapy from about the time I was 4 years old. Our family therapist/doctor was Dr. Love, I am not kidding that was his real name. All kinds of things were going on in my family that I was not aware of until I was grown. One was the fact that my real father was sexually molesting my older half sister.......I was labeled a ""bad child"" ""out of control child"" and was locked in my room for hours at the time which was what our doctor told them to do.....I would not cry when I was punished or spanked and my mom would have to stop my dad from whipping me to keep him from killing me I suppose. I was the youngest of 4 children, 1 real sister 1 half sister and one half brother. Although after I was grown I found out that my real sister was only half too... I was very creative in a strange kind of way while I was locked in my room. I would open my window a scream for help with my tape recorder on, so when I got tired I could play it back so maybe someone would come......we had big metal blinds in the windows and for some reason I would raise the blind all the way up and tie the string to my door knob when I would go to sleep at night so the blind would fall if anyone opened my door... Crazy huh??? Any way, when I was about 11 years old I was put in a foster home, you know cause I was a bad child. Then I went to group homes, back and fourth here and yonder. Never tested for anything.....never medicated.....I was back and fourth from home, foster homes, group homes and mental hospital from the age 11 to 16. During one of the times I was gone my parents divorced, and my mom moved to a new house. I had met a guy during one of my short stays home, and thought that he was my world. You know by then I thought no one loved me, except for him. He was my world. My oldest sister told me that if we got married I couldn't be sent away any more. She knew how it was being at those places in the 70's and 80's....I mean if you weren't already ""mad"" you would be.....So I married the only person in the world that I thought loved me......As soon as we were married, I got pregnant. He cheated on me, controlled me, I couldn't even go outside without him beating me. He would come in from his girlfriend's house and if I said anything about it, he would go off and throw things and call me every name in the book, take aerosol spray cans and a lighter and throw flames at me until I was in the corner begging and crying for him to stop. He beat me in my stomach and said he hoped I lost the baby. He said if I ever left him he would kill me. I had to get stitches over my eye where he busted it. Of course I lied to the doctor.....scared for my life. All of this went on for a year, when my daughter was born he was not even there. His parents had to go get him out of his girlfriends bed....I was young and dumb. I thought that everything would get better now, I mean he was the only one in the world that ""loved"" me. Things got worse and when my daughter was weeks old he got in one of his moods and was beating on me and his grandma. That's who we lived with. He went out in the yard and took an axe to all the cars and his dad came over to stop him. My husband took the baby out of my arms and held her over his head in the street and threatened to drop her......that's the day I left him. His father called the police and had them come get him. Then he called my mom and told her she had better come get me and the baby if she didn't want us dead. He said that he had got my husband locked up for now, but that it was his son and that he did have to go get him out. So my mom came and helped me pack up and leave...... That is the first chapter of my life......it doesn't get any better.....but it does help to tell all on here. I will tell more later. I need to go to sleep for a while and pass some time. Thanks for the chance to just ramble on here."
dsf,"it's 3am and i can't sleep. i have got so many thoughts rushing through my head. i've tried writing them down and drawing pictures and doing mind numbing things to try and stop me thinking but it's not working. i just feel so angry for no particular reason.

i feel really violent and have been having thoughts about hurting people. i'm not that kind of person. i haven't cut for nearly 2 months, and i just attacked my legs with a broken glass because i had to get it out of my system somehow.

i don't know what's going on, i haven't been depressed lately i've been feeling pretty good really. i thought i was just getting things back under control and now whoosh i'm losing control again. i just want to stop thinking. i'm actually thinking about banging my head against the wall until my brain slows down."
dsf,"Hi everyone, I'm new, and feeling kind of lost and shy. To introduce myself a little, I'm a 28 year old female. Up until about a year ago, I'd never had any problem with depression or any other mental illness, though all of the other women in my family have depressive tendencies. Suddenly, I started to feel differently in my mind - a feeling which has gone on getting worse and worse. The last four months in particular have been a downward spiral. I moved house from a big city to a small village late last year, and I'm not dealing with the change well. I don't know anyone in my local area, and I don't drive so I'm stuck in this little isolated world (I work from home). I lack the energy and the confidence to go out and meet new people. I tend to organize/run everything in our household so basic routines have just fallen apart, and my long-term relationship is under strain. My partner doesn't understand how I feel, while I resent the fact that he's making no effort to recognize the problem and take some action to help. My family and friends are 300 miles away, and I don't feel able to talk to them. This last week, I found out my Mum is having tests run for breast cancer. I know it's early days but it's just the last little thing that has pushed me over the edge. I am walking around either in a state of complete, grey numbness or in a state of unutterable misery, unable to react to anything in a rational way. I haven't left the house for days, because I hate the village where I live and being there just sends me into a blind panic attack. I've had an initial assessment for counseling in a city near where I live, but it'll be weeks before I can get an appointment. I know that I need to go and see a GP and get some medication, but I don't have the energy even to pick up the phone and talk to the receptionist, let alone to walk on my own through the horrible village. And I'm just so exhausted all the time. The internet's my only point of contact with the outside world at the moment. If all this sounds familiar to anyone, please reply - it would be a lifeline for me. Thanks Wizzy."
dsf,"I have never chatted on a chat line before. So please bear with me. I'm 29 years old married with three children. In the last 12 months I have lost my grandmother in September 2004, my father in February 2005, gave birth to a baby girl in May 2005, and now lost my only aunt which was just like a mother to me.  The way I feel now scares me.  I thought after I lost my grandma and dad I held it together pretty good, but after my aunt died I felt like I lost everything.  I have always been a very strong person someone other people leaned on. Now I literally can't get out of bed, I don't want to talk to anyone, or see anyone.  My mind feels like it is racing with things i have to do like cook, clean, pay bills, tend to my children, but i just can't do anything.  I even quit my job because i simply felt i couldn't go to work.  I would just like to know what is happening."
dsf,"I have been in two accidents one in October (went to take pictures of my sister in the parade, she was nominated for homecoming queen), and one in February. The first accident really messed not only my mind, but my body up. Now I am 23, and have severe back, shoulder, and knee pain that I have been treated for, and other pain that I just refuse to go to the doctor for (all from the first accident). I have done the specialist thing, and physical therapy. Nothing has made me feel better other than temporarily (if all I do physically is nothing). I can't work, clean, or do anything I enjoy without it making the pain worse. I am at my witsi end. I am in the deepest hole I have ever been in. I can't take having to choose between mental stability, and physical stability anymore. Some days I wonder why I even get out of bed. Nothing good comes out of it. I would give anything in the world to feel better. Last night I just cried myself to sleep, because I am not the only person dealing with this. I take my emotions out on everyone around me including my husband. Lately I can't help, but think he deserves better. I suppose I don't think I know. Sorry for ranting like this, but I just needed to get all of this out of my head. I thought if it wasn't in there it wouldn't bother me so much."
dsf,"Depression never ends does it?  You take the Paxil or whatever pill they prescribe.  You take it for years and years and every day you still feel so down and lonely and empty inside.   I'm sick of being sick.  I'm tired of being tired.  I don't know for sure if I want to kill myself or not.  I've made several attempts at it but then sometimes I think I don't really want to die I just want this life to get better.  Some people have ""normal"" lives don't they?  Why do they have normal lives, and what the heck is wrong with me?  Why can't I just snap out of it someday and be someone productive!?!?!   I HATE MYSELF, I hate the way I've made my life.  I want a job that says I matter, I want to rewind and start over knowing what I know now!  RANT RANT RANT - I hate life!"
dsf,"Hi folks, I've only discovered this topic after making several previous posts :) I am from a traditional Asian culture, but now half-westernized on migration to Australia since age 6. I've had a long history that stems right to my parents' histories before I was born. To cut it very short, my father has schizoid/schizotypal/socially withdrawn personality traits, and my mother has dependent traits, so they basically had a loveless marriage (common in my culture). There is a long history of parental quarrelling and physical abuse on my mother before and after I was born, some of which I heard as a child to early teens. I was seldom exposed socially growing up, and I had few school friends. I was also 'born' a quiet person, but this and lack of socializing made me a withdrawn kid. When I was about 4, I believe I experienced one psychotic episode (I 'saw' 2 caped 'grim reapers' at that time), since which I have no further experiences. I experienced a few bouts of depression during secondary school, for which I didn't seek help because of my shyness and parental/cultural stigma that 'depression does not exist' (thankfully my family has ditched that attitude now). During that time, I had many suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide maybe 3 times but didn't tell anyone about it. A very terrible incident also happened towards the end of high school - one night, I physically assaulted my father while he was quarrelling with mom, and he was hospitalized. I got charged with assault, but no conviction was recorded after I did psychotherapy for anger control - that was also the only therapeutic contact with psychological/psychiatric services I had until very recently. That incident, although I felt numb through that time, has been scarred into my memory - I can still recall the events, and my conscience is still wrecked over it, though I continue to fight it and let it go. At school, I was a top-end academic achiever in science and math. I was named dux of the school on graduation. Upon entering university, my depression became worse mainly because of increased social isolation. I was still shy and withdrawn, I lost contact with my high school friends (they also saw me as 'weird', but I was also a bit narcissistic towards them at some times - I think it was an unconscious aggressive reaction towards them), and failed to make any lasting friendship with university peers. One year into university, I started studying Medicine, which I am still doing at the moment. However I felt that course had over time did not improve me, though I did make few friends. I still felt unable to socialize with peers, even though I was in constant contact with them through many lectures and tutorials. Even though I was an average performer, I felt I struggled heavily through the years with study. Late last year, my depression hit a new low - my parents had another quarrel, and I was studying psychiatry which forced me to realize the extensiveness of my past and current problems. It was another awful time - I lost a lot of self-confidence/esteem, became more withdrawn. I ended up failing my first practical exam but still passed given my past satisfactory academic record - the faculty put it down to lack of practice, but the truth is because of what I experienced leading up to the exam. In this year however my depressive bouts became much worse - my few friends had deferred, and I was left with no friends, despite still knowing the others 'by name'. My experience during this year was largely negative - I felt harassed by teaching doctors, peers, being looked at as a 'weirdo' and excluded from conversations and their social outings (whether this was a valid view, I'm finding out now by resocializing with them - my main aim at the moment). Over the last 2 months I had about 5 more depressive episodes, and attempted suicide 3 times, again nobody knew about them. It became a frantic situation - I approached the faculty dean for help, but he only recommended me a psychiatrist, who he was supposed to contact before I contacted him. However that psychiatrist wasn't notified, and I felt very angry about it and thought that nobody was out there to help me. In retrospect, my view was unrealistic - help only exists on a professional level, something I knew long before but did not acknowledge at that time, making me upset. My depression faded away a few days later. A few nights ago, I had a short dispute with mom, got upset and this eventually led to me joining this forum after a quick search on the net. Why am I writing this intro? Several reasons. I want to tell my story to others, and feel this is a stepping stone to encourage myself. I also want others not yet aware that depression can affect ANYONE, even the best of us, even those involved in the medical profession (up to 30% of junior doctors suffer from depression, and up to 10% have attempted/committed suicide). I want to improve my own situation - most of all, learning to deal with feelings of sadness and negatively that has crippled me mentally in the past, and my lack of sociability which doesn't help my situation. I know deep inside I am capable of pulling through, of being able to live a normal healthy life because I am aware of my problems and have the power to deal with them. Finally, although I'm still a student, I believe my position is privileged and that I should use what knowledge I have learnt to help others as best as I can, something I will be bound to by Hippocratic Oath on finishing school. I am grateful that such a forum exists for others and me to express our thoughts, experiences and feelings, and that there are people out there who devote themselves for such causes. Thank you all."
dsf,"I am very new to this forum so if I mess up on some of this edit stuff, I'm sorry. I am 29 years old, I have 4 children that which includes 9 year old twins. I had my last child in 2002. I have had depression ever since. It never went away. I also got married. My life changed completely. People don't even know who I am anymore. The bad thing is I don't even know who I am anymore. I feel like I am living for everyone else. I ask for nothing and expect nothing. I used to set such high standards for myself, I have a diploma and a 2 - year college degree. It means nothing to me now. I have not been able to work in 4 years and I am a person who went to work at 16. MY body is so weak now I take all this medicine and still no sleep. any thoughts will be helpful."
dsf,"During my high school years I was always a little ""klooster"" never went out that much never did anything bad ..... When I left school I moved to Johannesburg and from there moved to my mom in Mpumalanga, South Africa, a day before my 21st birthday I got raped ..... the most terrible feeling ever, I was not wearing any revealing clothes, had jeans a t-shirt and tekkies on, how do you explain this. I always believed that those girls, wearing the most revealing clothes are the ones that ask for it, but do they really?  I can not see how any one can ask for this, it is the worst thing that can ever happen to you.  A few months thereafter I had to have an abortion due to the fact that I could not keep the baby ...... I was way too young, I never and still up until date, don't believe in this type thing, but now I think?  Was it the right thing to do, will you ever be able to face the child the same way you will face a child born into a happy and wonderful marriage? I also suffer from depression, high blood pressure and all those wonderful things, I got married in December 2005 and due to me and my fiance having a big argument with my dad, he never walked me down the aisle on my big day and me and my husband had to pay for the whole wedding, I feel awful, but the things my dad said and done can never be forgiven.  My stepsister had a baby at the end of December and she is getting married now in April 2006, guess who is doing and paying for her wedding .....

I feel sick, sick of people always walking over me, always stuffing it in my face and my frustration gets taken out on the wrong people, my husband is the one getting it?  I battle to have healthy sex, due to the fact that every time I close my eyes, I see this person on top of me, forcing himself in, I feel guilty to have kids, how can I have more, if I killed one? How can I bring up a family if my own family is up to shit ....

I often find myself wondering why? Why me, why am I the one crying myself to sleep, why do I have to keep myself in tone, to prevent a stroke, especially at my young age??"
dsf,"I am starting to feel really frustrated with life because there are things I don't understand about the world. My problem is I think too much and I wish I was off in space thinking about a night out in the city but I'm not. Instead I focus on every negative thing I can. I would never kill myself and because I wouldn't do that I really want to know how I can get over all this shit and be happy with what I got. I don't know if it's my mind playing the victim but I feel like everyone close to me is out to hurt me. For example I am 20 and I don't have a car. I can understand I should already have it like two years ago but this a prime point for my parents to pick on me. For some reason my mom got herself into a bit of a mood and started having a go at me which caused me to end up in tears because she told me I am hopeless and so are all my brothers and that I am an embarrassment. This is all because I don't have a car! She's usually really caring but she came out with all this stuff. Am I going crazy or is it really a huge deal to not yet have a car? Is it worth hurting your daughter over?? Then there is my supposed ""boyfriend"" who picks on me about my weight. I am not as thin as I once was. I've put on about 10 kilos in 3 years. I know it's not a good thing but for ages everything was about my weight. I used to weigh 54 kg which is tiny and now I am 64kg. My boyfriend is at university and thinks that my life holds no meaning because I apparently have no hobbies and I just turn up to my ""little job"".  I have friends that are completely selfish and I always end up paying for everything and they can't even do me a simple favor. I don't want to play the victim because I've been a punching bag for so many people who themselves have played the victim so it's nothing I would aspire to be.

 

I could write pages and pages and pages of how annoyed I am but I thought I'd just give an idea. I'm sick of people being the way they are to me and making me out to be a energy drain. Does anyone know what to do to not feel bad about who you are?"
dsf,"I've basically been living a lie for the last year.  My depression / social anxiety has become so crippling that I'm scared to work outside of the home, but I told my parents that I was working anyway, because I didn't want them to know how bad it was.  I wasn't taking money from them or anything (I don't live with my parents, and my husband has a great job and I don't technically HAVE to work)  but now that I've come clean about it my mother says she feels ""manipulated.""  I guess I can see why, and I do feel really bad about lying to them.  I suppose that their forgiveness will just take time.  But the thing is, I can't tell any of them HOW BAD THIS REALLY IS, including my husband.  It's to the point now where I'm even afraid to see a doctor.  I'm sure there isn't some magic formula for getting past actually having to admit that you have a really serious problem,  but I was just wondering how some of you were able to get past that feeling of embarrassment and shame that keeps you from getting help, and telling the people you love the truth.   Every day is getting harder and harder, especially now that my family knows I've been lying.  I really thought telling them would make everything a little easier (lying = instant paranoia!), but now I can't stop thinking about how I've ruined my relationships with them forever, and I'm even more hopeless than I was before.  How can I get past this embarrassment?"
dsf,"before i start i want to apologize to everyone for not offering much support recently. For those of you not in a good place right now, i hope things start to ease for you soon. Sending my love to you all and i am thinking about everyone.

Lycan hope your hangover is well and truly gone and that you are ready for another week at work.

Well i went to the GP on thursday and she was really lovely, really listened to what i had to say and she wants me to go away and consider going on antidepressants, before i make a final decision.

While there she spotted a mole on my arm and she looked through this little gadget. She thinks its skin cancer (Melanoma) and has sent an urgent referral to the dermatologist. So i am now waiting on an appointment for a biopsy. I am kind of upset about it, i know they can probably get rid of it, but it doesn't stop the panic attacks and anxiety.


So all in, I am not in a good place right now, but hopefully things will start to get better soon."
dsf,"I had really bad anxiety attacks/panic attacks when I am on the first couple days of my period. I mean bad... to the point of having to stay home from school for 2-3 days. I would be in so much pain and extremely depressed and so many other symptoms. I found that when I got on birth control... around 5 months on it, they stopped being so horrible. I do still have to watch my diet around the time though... my blood sugar gets extremely low and I pass out and shake a lot. I'd say maybe talk to your doctor about birth control... it was a lifesaver for me. I just wanted to rip my danged uterus out!"
dsf,"As my guidance counselor has pointed out to me, depression is anger and hatred turned inward... now, aside from the cliché, I'll try to answer your question... I suppose I have been hating myself since first grade (the earliest I remember) when I wrote that I hated myself in my school folder...Currently I am 18, and I have been in therapy with a psychologist for a year and 3 months now and currently am not taking any medications. I am not sure if my depression causes my self esteem issues, but I feel it is more likely in my case that my self esteem issues help fuel my depression. As far as your question about treatment, I cannot speak for medication seeing as how I have never experienced it, but I have had a very very positive therapy experience...being able to connect with someone, and learn to trust, has made me feel valuable and important in life. I highly recommend, if you are comfortable of course, trying cognitive therapy...it may feel impossible and overwhelming at first, and it can be difficult to find a good match in a therapist, but once you do and are able to really work with them, it's all worth it"
dsf,"I think letters are a wonderful way to communicate. That way you don't say anything without thinking about it first. I wasn't clear if your mother actually read the letter or not. If she hasn't, I might suggest approaching the letter with just the first issue of the way she treats you (without the father issue) in one letter. That might open dialogue and allow you guys to focus on fixing that first. I understand your fear of authority figures. When I was that age (I'm 31 now) I couldn't talk to anyone of authority. My mom, who was shy herself had to do that kind of stuff for me. Could another one of your relatives go with you to take your drivers test? Nana or Sonny who you mentioned in the letter? If it helps to hear, I did get over my fear of authority figures and sometimes I go overboard and challenge them (to make up for lost time?). I never had psychotherapy, but I wish I had. So don't discount it, nip it in the bud if you are able to. One other question I have is...is your mother ALWAYS this way or does she show moments of tenderness, sympathy or interest in your life? I think that if you've seen the mom in her in the past, it sounds like she has some internal problems that she takes out on you, but have nothing to do with you. Don't worry about how you should be at this age...everyone has their own time clock inside. If we were all the same, this would be a very very boring world. You sound like an interesting, thoughtful man. I wish you could see that."
dsf,"This message is especially for newcomers desperately seeking a way out of the depression rut. Please read my words carefully as a lot of thought and devotion went into this:

A year ago, I was stuck in the miserable rut of depression with little or no hope of finding a way out. I was attending mandatory group therapy after an attempted suicide and 72 miserable hours in the nut house. They put me on Remeron which helped a little ... taking some of the edge off the suicidal thoughts, but little else. Weeks of trying to learn cognitive behavior therapy went by and hopes of getting better were dwindling. Then one day, my best friend gave me a book which taught me how to properly apply the CBT. Many of you have tried CBT to no avail. I sincerely believe that you did not do it either properly, hard enough, and / or long enough. When retraining the mind, it's vitally important to diligently apply CBT daily for several weeks. (See my webpage for more info: Antidepressant That Works). Once this becomes a regular habit, I'm confident you will see improvement as I did. I'm positive you can do it too. It was the toughest job I've ever had to do, but it sure was worth it. Whenever a negative situation presents itself now, I just block it out and replace it with a positive thought automatically. It's hard in the beginning, but it's totally do - able. Plus, it gets easier after awhile. Then, once it becomes automatic, you don't even have to think about it.

Properly applied CBT helps tremendously, but it's not a complete cure as you will see in my story. You must also take care of your body because it's what furnishes your brain with the proper nutrients. The two go hand in hand. The brain regulates the endocrine system and the neurotransmitters while the body provides the brain with the proper chemicals to do its job.

Leisure activities help also. I know it's difficult for some of you to have fun, but it's important to get your mind off your problems even if just for a little while. I mention motivation in my story. Sometimes you just have to force yourself to do what's good for you even if you don't want to. Contrary to what many believe, motivation begins with action ... not visa - versa. The sooner you begin to properly apply the techniques I learned and the more effort you put in to them, the sooner you will get better. Hopelessness and doubt will be your enemy, so try to put them aside for a month as you get on the road to wellness.

I have been off antidepressants for almost a year now. I feel great ... plus my concentration and comprehension are back. March 5 marked my one year anniversary without alcohol too. I'm basically drug free and am as happy as I was 5 years ago before the depression nearly ruined my life."
dsf,"I see no way out, except to stop this life. I am 59 years old and have not worked since 2004 due to depression and anxiety disorders. I live on social security disability. I barely have enough money to live on. I lost all my savings after losing my job as a teacher. I did make my car payment, but I could not pay my other bills. I have about $14,000 in debts now. I have not been able to work due to depression and panic attacks. I should try to work, but my teaching credential has expired. I would have to move to another area to find a teaching job now, after being let go from my last job here. I am afraid to move away. At my age I should have savings and be ready for retirement (and have retirement). But I have nothing. I rent a room here in expensive Santa Barbara. I am stuck in fear and nothingness. I'm scared and I keep thinking of suicide, but I'm afraid it will not work and I will be worse off. Is anybody in a situation like mine? Does anybody have any words of wisdom?"

I went on with the conversation, but felt so uncomfortable. I know him and all, but after the conversation, I find myself saying ""Wow...that was awful...I suck at life.""

dsf,"Hi, I am Ellen a.k.a. Froggie girl62, a 43-year-old female who has been depressed for life. I have been labeled as having dysthymia in the past. Although it was never officially shared with me, I believe from what I have read that I was depressed even as a child. I graduated college the first time in 1985 with a BA in Sociology with Medical Emphasis and have worked in the medical transcription field for 19 years. I have become bored with the job and dissatisfied with being forced to work from home. (Majorly boring!) Last year I started going back to school to pursue a Masters in Fine Arts in Graphic Design. This has been a huge challenge since I am brand new in the art field and most of the other students are already artists. In addition, I MUST work 40 hours a week to maintain my health insurance benefits. My mom has been my best friend and support person forever and now she has been diagnosed with lung cancer. She had surgery 2 months ago and just began chemotherapy last week. I have had an awful time dealing with this. Although she has been given a fairly decent prognosis, I am scared that she is going to leave me and would trade places with her in flash if I could. Truthfully I am disappointed every day when I wake up. I save lots of money on products to remove mascara, as the tears usually do the job. I had been on Zoloft 25 mg since the late 1990s and my family doctor increased it first to 50 and now to 100 mg. I have also started seeing a psychiatrist, only 2 sessions so far, so hard to say much about that. In the past when I went for counseling, they just gave me silly assignments and told me to go out and meet people. With my school work, I have enough assignments already. I found this forum from a post on another support forum."
dsf,"I myself have suffered Major Depression Disorder for years. I myself got diagnosed in the last year and half with Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate, Severity; Disorder of Written Expression; Reading Disorder; and even Asperger's Disorder. I was diagnosed in 2004. The Doctor and I did many tests. When I got My diagnosed with depression by the doctor I Myself was not surprise by the diagnoses. Though we did not to what I remember did not talk about depression. I knew I have been suffering depression for years that even I could diagnose myself. I myself have been trying to get help for myself for the last five years. I have been on various drugs like Paxil which had made me suicidal in 2000. I got off it though before I did commit suicide I thank God for that. My depression has always made me suicidal at one time or another. Living with depression has made me do things like drinking and such things like that in My Life. With My Depression in My Life has lead Me to find Myself in ways that I am learning from My Depression. I have a cousin that committed suicide 2005 His Life will be missed I know for Myself for He also suffered a Major Depressive Disorder. I sometimes just feel like giving up Myself but have yet found something so I will not give up in the end. I hope I still yet learn something that I do not every give up. I have done this for many years with out any doctors or drugs to help Me. Sometimes I wonder why I am still here living on this Earth. It sometimes has been very hard for Me just like My cousin. I will leave it there"
dsf,"I tried to get onto the chat room, but it won't let me so I'll just post my question here. In my sociology class today my professor was talking about an experiment where several pseudomanic (healthy) patients checked into mental hospitals to record the results. The details of the experiment aren't important, but what I was wondering was about how my teacher said that the patients used fake names so that it would not be on their permanent record and so that they wouldn't be labeled as ""crazy"". So I raised my hand and asked who would be labeling them and why they couldn't use their real names, like how would people know? He said that it would be on their record and that if people wanted to find out if they have ever been hospitalized they could, particularly employers. Kind of like if you wanted to inquire about a rapist living in your town, is what he said. I wanted to ask more but didn't want to press it. So my questions are, what kind of record does this go on? Your hospital record? Your police record? When employers do a background check, does this show up? Then I was wondering, when police pull you over for speeding or something and they check your information on their computer, what comes up? Everything? If they were involved in an ambulance taking someone into the hospital, do they have that on file? Is there any way to see what's on your file? I'm just a little paranoid now about if there are going to be limitations in life now as to what I can do because of my record.

Or if anyone knows how I would be able to find out this information that would be great,"
dsf,"Well, it is nearly time.
I swore to myself that I will not be dealing with depression by the time I will be 40.
Shit, my 39th is toddling along shortly, so I will have only one more year to keep my promise.

Gee, no idea whether I be able to make it, but I swore to myself that I have to have the darn depression stuff under my wings by then.

So, keep your fingers crossed for me. The clock is ticking .. 

PS: heh, heh, just thought, since I LOOK nearly 80 presently, maybe I could get a bonus day or two of extension, because of the depressing reflection in mirrors. What do you think?"
dsf,"Hi - I am ""dad"" a new member today (12/18/05) I like what I have seen so far and have a need to express myself and get some feedback from others. It is so hard to look at yourself..... especially when wearing the ""dark glasses"" of depression. I am a man in my late 40's - educated, with family- wife and two great, smart, loving kids, 15, and 13. I will try to summarize my story. About 5 yrs ago, I was laid off (tech field)...it was very hard to find another good position. We were so spoiled, I was making 70K - 100K in the past few years. We took it for granted. We built (4) new houses since 1989 - and did well. We enrolled our kids in a private Christian school (a high priority for us) THEN - My wife was in a auto accident and has spinal damage. She is ""mobile"", but has chronic pain. She is also suffering from depression. I managed to find another job, but it was a very dysfunctional place. I had to take a few leave-of absences - then I became ""pegged"" as a weak person. They eventually let me go for ""too many LOA's"" I'm paying $800 for COBRA - we can't do this forever....the pressure just adds to my anxiety. After seeing my psychiatrist, he took me through MANY medicines and even ECT's.... we tried for three years to find the most effective drug. Presently I take Zoloft, Cymbalta, Lamictal,Xanax & Valium for anxiety. I also have osteopenia (bone density loss), so I take, fosamax and Tylenol 4 (narcotic) for back/joint pain. Lastly, I use Soma for muscle strain. I don't know if the medicines are helping me or adding to the problem....? I admit I ""lean on"" some of the medicines as a coping mechanism. I have had so many situational events in the last few years, I suspect my depression is more environmentally caused...? I seem to ruminate on the ""bad events of the past"" too much. I am ""stuck"" - and just can't seem to get aggressive at my job hunt. We just sold our 6 bedroom house and are now living in a three bedroom apartment. I feel guilty that my family has to go through this. I know that I have skills and experience; but I don't have the self confidence - my ego is ""on the floor"". My sleep pattern is crazy and my appetite for food (and sex) is GONE. My wife is getting frustrated with me and doesn't always ""build me up""... Her depression has her down too.... With two depressed parents,it is very difficult to support each other. I feel ""stuck"" and don't know what to do....sometimes I just feel like giving up.... Any comments or thoughts would be appreciated!"
dsf,"ok, so today i had another freak out. I woke up feeling good ... it was supposed to be my first therapy session (which i and my boyfriend were happy about) and then after this i was supposed to meet up with my boyfriend for lunch, check my test marks, and then go to the library with my boyfriend to study. These plans changed...

When i walked into the therapy office, they said no appointment was scheduled. All of a sudden i felt really rejected, not worthy of an appointment (like they gave it to someone else), anxious, sick to my stomach, a little dizzy. I've been waiting since February for this appointment! I couldn't deal with my anger properly or the fact that my plans for therapy were ruined today. I started stuttering kind of i kind of got all dazed out and really sick when the receptionist wanted to schedule another appointment. So, it's tomorrow at 9am ... 9am!!! What bastards.

Anyway, so because i got all weird ... i didn't want to be around people. I called my boyfriend ... couldn't get a hold of him. I cancelled .... didn't check my marks, didn't go to the library, or lunch or see my boyfriend. I left. I told my boyfriend i had bad anxiety.

So, now he wants a ""break.""

And I've been in my room since i got home (since about 1pm) .... feeling really low and weird and lightheaded ....

I've been rocking a lot too on my rocking chair ... it's a weird compulsive soothing mechanism i have. Don't ask.

I'm mad at my boyfriend because he decided to take a break when i needed him most. Is this cold or what?! At the same time i understand: he wants his ""brain clear"" for exam studying.

Whatever. I guess it's hard being with a depressed, neurotic girl. No one wants to be with a depressed girl. Let's not kid ourselves here."
dsf,"I have always felt different, i guess i am a little weird, loner  gay, but at the same time smart loving, people admire me and respect me . i felt depression back in 96. tried different medications, until, effexor worked for me, then i felt good for several years now depression has come back again, and with much vengeance. it took my soul and mind, I am back with my partner after a short break up which i think caused the monster to come back, i lost motivation in life and i called my ex to come back into my life since i was feeling suicidal, he claims he loves and will be there for me, and he has been a great deal of support for me. i'm taking cymbalta for 4 weeks now but my doctor says it will take 2 more weeks until we decide which medication i should stay with. in the meantime there are suicidal thoughts, running in my head as well as some of hope. i would hate to miss out on my son's high school graduation, or my own graduation from the RN program. as a nurse i know that there is hope, but no matter how much knowledge you have you will always feel lost and helpless when depression is in your body. my message is that we should be patient and continue to do positive things because at the end, all this mess in our heads, will only seem like a period of time where we were sleeping or we blanked out, i am hurting so much and i know there are many more hurting out there, but let's be kind to ourselves and give ourselves words of appreciation and affection, over and over, take care of yourselves and be PATIENT, just like i will be.  God is there watching over us and will not let us perish, unless we want to."
dsf,"This is a really great forum and nice to know there are other men out there willing to help as they know what it's like. It's also funny how sometimes what you think you are doing and what other perceive are totally different. For example, my wife has recently stated that she feels like she's living in a ""glass jar."" What she means it that due to my depression and anxiety she, at times, feels like she has to act or say things differently because of how she thinks I'm going to interpret them. Whereas all I want is for her to act normal and do and act as she was and let me deal with the insecurities and issues. I hope this is making some sense to some of you and if so, any suggestions on what to do? Thanks!"
dsf,"I was just reading back over the past few entries. I have been in tough shape and I didn't realize how tough until I read it over. The depression, the arthritis, and the circumstances of my life all have been conspiring to keep me down.  My therapist was right, I think, when she said on Monday that I needed sometime to just ""be"". I've stopped answering my phone and have spend most of the past few days watching DVDs, playing computer games and resting my sore body. I feel better emotionally since I have been doing this. I wish I didn't feel so horribly guilty for checking out of the world for a few days, but I'm willing to cope with it if it makes ma feel a little better. The other thing I am feeling guilty about is this training I am supposed to go to in Washington, DC in two weeks. I feel like if I go I will be letter all sorts of people down at work. I have even contacted the people running the training and asked if I can delay it, but it is now or never and since it is all expenses paid in Washington for three days if I pass it up at the last minute I am screwing someone else out of the opportunity. If I go or if I don't go I am going to feel guilty and selfish. I'm not going to decide now though.  I am just going to keep up with the resting for another day."
dsf,"I am 23 years old. After a long time of finally trying to get my life on track, I finally had it all together. I found the person I was meant to be with for the rest of my life and everything was so wonderful. I have never been so happy. I had known this guy for two and a half years and we always liked each other. Obstacles kept coming up that prevented us from being together; one being that I live in Kentucky and he lives in Texas. After I broke up with my ex in December, we finally got together. He was going to move here in June and it was going to be perfect. Then a few days ago he got into a horrible car crash and lost his memory. He still remembers me but he remembers me as a friend. He doesn't remember me the way we were ... in love. Now whenever I talk to him .... he won't tell me that he loves me back and he acts like I make him uncomfortable. When I tell him about the way things used to be, he doesn't seem to care. I don't he can't remember but it is so devastating for me. I'm terrified that he won't remember how much he loved me and that he will find someone else down there. I am finding it extremely hard to cope and almost feel like I can't function. I don't know what to say/do anymore. Any advice / thoughts would be so appreciated!"
dsf,"Hello, I think this is where I introduce myself...I'm 34 I've been suffering severely with depression since I was 6. I've not yet been properly diagnosed, most likely because I have to go to the county and I live in the poorest county in California. I know I'm EXTREMELY obsessive compulsive, I've been told I'm major depression, ocd, add, and now may possibly be bipolar of the severe kind....oh. boy. I'm confused as hell. I have no mentally ill friends and the others just take advantage of me. If I try to talk to my mom she breaks down, she is trying more now, it's just recently they really started believing I'm really ill and not jus a hustler. The medications have been tearing me apart, one almost gave me a heart attack. I would really like to talk to someone who understands me with out having to go to the 3rd floor again. Maybe there's someone out there who has a sensitivity to these medicines too ... who can help? so far some take off the edge, but I always end up breaking down and EXPLODING. I can't hold down a job, and with the state off the economy I can't get disability...so sometimes It's the streets. I'm REALLY TIRED, can anyone feel me? Thanks for your time,"
dsf,"I am an 18 year old senior, i was sending this because the other night i had a dream that i was pregnant but when i went to the hospital to have it delivered it was taken from me, then last night i had another dream that i was at a hospital and i got trapped inside and i was about to have my baby ... what does this mean?? I am not sure if I am pregnant or not i am too scared to find out because i am not sure how to tell my mother  could my dream be trying to tell me something important??"
dsf,"I have been on antidepressants for probably 10 years now. I was on Serzone which worked very well. My husband and I decided to get pregnant so I had to stop it. I have now been on Zoloft, Effexor and Celexa. I am currently taking 40mg Celexa (generic) and 75 mg Effexor. What I'm wondering is- are hot flashes normal with antidepressants? I don't remember having them on Serzone but I have had them since I started Zoloft. I'm not sure if this is from the medications or pregnancy and nursing? Anyone have experience with this- either medications or pregnancy and breastfeeding? I am 26 by the way"
dsf,"I am currently on Zoloft - 25 mg a day, and my once high sex drive has evaporated.  I am only 24 and my boyfriend doesn't understand why the sudden complete lack of interest in sex.  It causes a lot of problems, and frankly - I feel like I'm too young to not enjoy / want sex.  The Zoloft in general helped a lot more in the beginning - now i still get quite anxious but I don't have the ""head that won't turn off.""  My doctor, though not excited about it, because it's a different class, has told me to start weaning off Zoloft and onto Wellbutrin.  I guess I'm nervous because I don't want to go back to feeling out of control and I was just wondering how everyone else has done comparatively, on Wellbutrin vs. Zoloft."
dsf,"My twenty year old sister died instantly in a car accident in march of 2005. It has been almost a year, and i have never had a dream about her, until tonight. In the dream, she goes from one family member to another, asking why we are ignoring her. She is extremely upset, and screaming that she doesn't understand. She sees me, starts toward me; and then i wake up. The overall sensation of the dream is that she stayed behind to take care of her fifteen month old daughter, and to give birth to the son she was pregnant with when she died. The strongest thing i picked up from the dream was the sensation that she doesn't know she's dead. Is there any meaning behind this dream? Am I losing my mind?"
dsf,"I'm new here - left an introductory ramble in the appropriate section.

I've been depressed (both clinically recognized or otherwise) for around 15 years (I'm 20 for the record).

After 3 - 4 months of a ""good"" period I'm finding that I'm slipping back into that ""black hole"".

I'm looking for support and very happy to offer everyone all I have to help, even if it's little.

I haven't been to a therapist in 2 years and I've not been on medication steadily for an even longer while (although I think I needed both in the meantime save for the past few ""happy"" months).

Anyway - take care everyone.

I know I'm new here but if anyone feels like they're cracking up, feel free to PM me. I'm used to the unpleasant ride depression gives people."
dsf,"Okay, here's the deal. I'm 17, and I have been depressed and suicidal for as long as i can remember. (See the post ""God Hates Me"") I just want to die. I hate living. It feels like no one cares. In order to combat my depression I write. To date I have written four major writings (50,000- 200  pages -  words or more) and am on my fifth. Last year, when I was on my first major writing one of my friends asked me if she could read it. I was hesitant because it's my soul. I take everything I feel and put it down on the page. It's all I do. i don't go out or have any kind of social life. Writing is my life.

But, I eventually let her read it. She liked it and read that whole writing. Since then she has become my editor of sorts. There's just one problem - she's not editing.

You see, she's a drama geek - in plays and everything - and doesn't have a whole lot of free time so I understand a slow pace, but lately I've had to prod her to do anything. Even over Christmas break she didn't do anything. Now, I have to call her on the weekends (which is the only time she'll even do it now) to get her to do anything. If I don't she'll forget she even has it. Every time I ask her about it, she just tells me how busy she is and I end up feeling guilty. I feel like she's rejecting me as a person, like she's saying ""i just don't care about you."" It hurts me so bad. It makes me feel like the one thing keeping me alive is stupid. It makes me want to kill myself. I feel like it's a burden to her. It hurts me so bad. It makes me go home and cut myself.
I have no idea how to handle the situation. I want her to do it, but I don't want it to seem like i'm pestering her. I understand she's busy, but she makes time to go out with her other friends. Couldn't she make a little time for me?

Am I being unreasonable here? What should I do? Please help."
dsf,"Haven't posted for a while because I've not been feeling too good. I'm becoming desperate and don't know what to do anymore. started taking ssri cipralex 2months ago and it has helped a lot with the anxiety and i thought it was helping my depression at first, but I'm starting to feel more depressed again. I've gained 2 and a half stone which is depressing in itself, but i wouldn't mind if i didn't feel depressed ,i would rather be fat and happy, but I'm just fat. I'm feeling much more suicidal and worrying constantly what is wrong with me. i feel physically unwell too. Don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm taking vitamins and eating protein and carbohydrates and doing everything I'm meant to be doing, apart from exercise, don't have the motivation. just so frightened and don't think things will ever get better, just want to end all the pain. am seeing psychiatrist tomorrow and considering stopping the ssri, but have had terrible withdrawal stopping prozac in the past and am afraid. its like I'm damned if i do and if i don't. if he suggests switching, then what about more side effects, just can't cope with this terrible disease anymore, just want to fall asleep and die."
dsf,"Ok here goes. I actually feel like I don't deserve to be looking at this site. I've been sitting here all morning reading through everyone's posts and have been think that I have no right to hate my life. I have a good family, friends and have had experiences other 20yr olds would only dream of. But there is something in my head telling me that my life sucks and nobody cares if I am here or not. Then the real me kicks back in and I think I am stupid for thinking that. STUPID. Stupid for thinking I have no purpose. So that makes me feel even worse. I fear. I don't know. Being alone and rejected I guess. I don't do I often but when I am having a 'fat week' I have purged and over exercised. I don't know if this is because I really think I am fat or. I don't know why else, but I am not overweight. I have never told any one any of this in person. I can't do it. I hate sympathy. When I am around my friends I am totally the opposite. I am so hyper and half the time it is not even an act sometimes I just can't control. Other times I do have to put it on just so that don't ask me if anything's up but I have never failed to fool them. Anyway that's enough"
dsf,"Hello, I'm new here. I'm 36 and have had depression since the age of 9. I'm supposed to take Lexapro every day, but often I forget. Memory / concentration is poor, one of the areas of the brain that depression screws with, the others being sleep, appetite, and libido.

Here's my thing ... I'm so gosh darn afraid to do anything! It's hard at times to even face my job, I call in sick and stay in pajamas all day. I do get out of bed, but I won't bathe or brush teeth. Isn't that gross! I did this on Monday and Tuesday this week.

I'm in school at night, it's a tele course class in geology. Last Friday we had an exam, and I didn't show up for it because I didn't do any reading for it. Now it's almost Wednesday, and I still haven't touched the reading. We can make up the exam no later than 1 week after the exam date, so I have two days to cover several chapters. Thing is, I'm SCARED CRAPLESS to even start!!! It's like I've got ""freeze - itis"" and I can't seem to study! I've been doing other things, like cleaning and laundry and doing Immigration research (trying to bring my Egyptian fiance here to the States), but haven't touched the geology, even though that's been #1 on my mind for two weeks. Even this past weekend, I had no plans (as usual!) and didn't crack open even one page.

I fear failure, and it's so hard to ""let go and let God"". I know in my head to give this fear to God, but I don't really know what that specifically means. In the meantime, I'm miserable and failing my geology class. Already I dropped the music class (originally I had two), since I was failing that royally.

Can anyone relate? How do any of you summon up the courage to face your fears?"
dsf,"Thought I'd introduce myself here before posting anything because to be honest I'm not even sure if I'm on the right forum to begin with. I've looked around for a semi-active forum about dysthymia (that's what I suffer from) but I couldn't find one anywhere. I've seen posts about bipolar disorder and OCD, besides depression on here so I thought I'd give it shot anyway. Do tell me if I'm in the wrong place, I don't want to ruffle anyone's feathers because that's just not fair on either of us! Anyway - where do I begin? Hard to tell really. Sometimes I wonder whether I've had dysthymia all my life. I know, that sounds like a big exaggeration, but do bear with me as I talk things out a little. I'm in venting mode at the moment after having a bit of a good cry - that didn't use to happen as often as it does now as of late. Basically I was a pretty normal kid until I was around 4 and a half. I was a daddy's girl, had the odd tantrum when I didn't get my sweets but there was no major deal going on. Things started to get a bit awry when my dad died. I was only four and a half as I said and being a daddy's girl I took it really badly. Although my mum had prepared me for it somewhat, the way you prepare a kid, I really wanted to believe he'd live and when he didn't I suppose I started losing hope in the world. Started sleeping a lot, withdrawing from the world, eating too little: you get the picture. things didn't get much better until mum and I translocated and went to live in southern Europe (sorry a bit paranoid to reveal just where I live at the moment). Things seemed to be alright for a brief while until I started second grade at school. From then onwards, most of the time, everything was shot to hell. I'm not saying I've not had my good moments but lets say that 80-85% of them were bad. The kids in my classes were mainly jerks - not their fault; not mine. You know it's just kids picking on kids because of my (then) buck teeth, my podgy tummy, my inability to speak the local language properly (was still in the learning process back then, makes sense aye?). Anyways I took it really to heart and eventually it got worse and worse until I lost the few friends I had and basically ended up marginalized. Getting through four years of that wasn't fun but I hoped that by making a couple of friends outside school things would change. And they did albeit for a short while. Eventually I made it into secondary school (a bit like middle school) but things didn't really get better. It was an all-girls-do and the most of the female jerks in my primary school happened to be in my class during my first year at secondary school. Therefore my 'loser' label sort of stuck. I did manage to make a few friends although they too seemed to be the 'outcasts' (nice people nonetheless). But then the two friends I'd made outside of school turned into... cows really and things started getting nasty. I ended up being the fat, ugly ducking both inside and outside school but I was too scared to tell the nasty 'friends' to leave me alone because I didn't want to be alone. Nice huh? It's funny what we do to ourselves when we're young. Boys inevitably became part of the picture outside school and I was always the one who got the 'uglier' boyfriend or far worse the perverted boyfriend. The latter became a problem of mine and I basically ended up in the middle of a statutory rape. It was summer and I was 13 at the time and that's when things started to get really ugly. I lost my 'friends' (which was probably a good thing) and I spent three months crying, feeling guilty, ashamed and over eating more than I had ever thought was possible. I'd always had a very weird relationship with food but now I was wolfing down a whole cake and 6 packets of chips a day. It's small miracle I only ballooned up to 65 kg really. When school started things got remotely better because I finally started to make some proper, true and real friends but the abuse haunted me. I cracked around the time I sat for my school leaving exams and started hurting myself. I'd been pulling out my hair for a few years but things got a little worse at this point. Quite miraculously, by some counts, I made it into College (equivalent of high school) and things got better there for the first year. I managed to lose some weight (probably because I spent previous summer drinking myself stupid and not eating very much) and I felt pretty confident. Maybe it was all a facade but I think that these were pretty happy times for me despite my inclination to drink tons upon tons (was drunk at least 3 days out of 7). Got myself a lovely boyfriend. Then I had pregnancy scare. Botched up somewhere along the lines by taking some pills I shouldn't have and basically it went from hero to zero. Ended up cheating on my boyfriend (who had become a really horrible guy) and we broke up. I was already falling to pieces at this point but it all got just that bit worse after I watched someone get fatally injured in a fight. I won't go into details but this is where I started abusing of myself pretty badly. I spent a long time battling self-injury, taking medication for the depression and/or bipolar disorder I DID NOT have and basically feeling like crap. I ended up developing insomnia too (maybe that explains why I'm writing this at 1:54am) which didn't really help. I attempted suicide (quite lamely) a few times but lived through it. It was only when I turned 19 that I was finally diagnosed as dysthymic. I was on medicines and started receiving therapy but I quit soon after because I couldn't afford it and I convinced myself I felt better after meeting my current boyfriend. I have a horrible habit of feeling 'okay' when I meet someone special. That feeling lasted for about... three months before I started cracking again. We're still together but it's been really hard coping at times. I'm in university now - my final year - less than 2 months away from my final exams which I MUST pass in order to graduate. Go figure that the studying is not going too well... Right now things seem to be taking their toll (hence the constant weeping, chain-smoking, lack of sleep, dead motivation, total procrastination, over-eating, frequent drink binges and general stupidity I know I should be avoiding like the plague). My boyfriend and I have quite a few serious problems. Life at home is good but everything else seems to be falling apart at the seams. I suppose I just want someone to talk to. I've done enough talking already though - haven't I? Sorry, I told you I'm in rant-mode tonight."
dsf,"My weight is ballooning out of control.

I take daily:

40 MG of Prozac (in the morning);  1 MG Klonopin (same time): 1 MG Klonopin (5 PM) 1 MG Klonopin (bedtime), prescribed by a psychiatrist.

I also take 1000 MG Keppra at bedtime for migraine prevention (prescribed by a neurologist).

I've been on various combinations of these for a couple of years.

The psychiatrist is doggedly insistent that the medications I'm on shouldn't be making me gain weight - but nonetheless they are.  I've had other medications that have given me side effects that I ""shouldn't"" have had - but nonetheless I do.

I have read many, many stories on the internet and through direct conversation with others that say they have had exactly the same things happen with SSRI's.

When I've asked him to change the medication, he keeps preaching ""diet and exercise"".  It hasn't worked.  I'm now down to the point where I eat virtually nothing and today I exercised to the point where I nearly blacked out.

This is causing problems between my wife and I (she also sees the same psychiatrist and takes Klonopin and Effexor), not least because I have no sexual desire.  None.

She sees him (the psychiatrist) tomorrow but I don't see him until April 6.

Yesterday in my therapy session I had an angry outburst that maybe I should just quit taking all the medication (because maybe I'm over medicated) and she didn't like that too much.

Am I going to have to die of obesity or over exercise to get his attention?  What do I have to do to convince them?

This is not helping my depression any when I can't stand to even look at myself in the mirror."
dsf,"I am a 40 year old mother of two; ages 14 and 4. I guess I have been depressed about everything more recently, but have been really depressed for about 5 + years now. I thought bringing a new child into my life 4 years ago would help, but it only increased. I am so lonely, with no friends (well, one) since I moved to upper New York 4 1/2 years ago from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I love my children, and my 21 hour job (that my doctor suggested). However, I do get to talk (chat) with anyone. I get every morning thinking that this day will be better, but it turns out to be sometimes worst than the day before ..... I guess, I am writing this to gain some friends, and feel that I am not alone in this situations I feel I am into .... I don't drink, I don't do drugs, and I take my prescribed Medications like I am suppose too ..... Is there anyone out there that would like to talk, or write, or e-mail me?"
dsf,"I have had borderline personality disorder since I was a little kid. Although then the therapist said it was Bipolar Disorder and ADHD. Since then I have been on pretty much every medication you can imagine and even sent to a temporary mental hospital. It isn't until now that I self diagnosed myself with BPD. I don't even think my doctor really thinks I have that although considering all the research I have done I fit the description perfectly. Since the age of 13 I was being self destructive by slamming my head in the was during times of stress. The first time I starting cutting was when I was 21. This was after an ex boyfriend left me. We had only been dating for 3 months. Sad huh. This went on sporadically for about a year and a half (during that time I committed myself). Finally I started dating my next boyfriend. He told me if I didn't stop cutting he would leave me. I stopped. We dated 2 years and then broke up. I am now 27 and married to another man who is 12 years older than me. We have been married almost a year (together for 3.5 years) and about 3 months ago I started cutting again. This time it is 3 times worse and I can't seem to stop. I am covered in scars and I have even gone as far as cutting the inside of my wrist. I am currently on Wellbutrin which does seem to be working (I do have a lot of good days). Although since I started to become depressed again I have been having a hard time dealing with the fact that my husband has a son. It didn't bother me as much (just a little) before because I did my best to stay busy. Since I got married I lost all my friends and now spend every other weekend alone. Mostly in bed. I never had to play mom before so I never thought I would ever be in the position to, so I just stayed out of the way. Plus, his son doesn't like me being around. Which makes me feel worse. In my state of mind I can't deal with that. My alone time is when I cut the most. My husband and I are in therapy, my therapist wants us to work. I am not so sure I can stay with him. Although I am having a hard time leaving. I am just so tired of feeling so alone all the time and he is just not capable of being there for me. This puts extra stress on him and I don't want that. Plus, it is my fault I married him, I knew he had a kid. I guess I didn't know I would get bad again. Last week we talked about me leaving. He ran upstairs and cried (he said he will fight for me) I went straight for the exacto knife. I had suicide in mind although I see myself as a wimp in that area which makes me feel even worse about myself. I cut 5 times on the inside of my wrist but I guess not deep enough. He came down and found me. My antidepressants work almost 80% of the time but whenever I think of losing my husband I get sad and hopeless. Every time I think of staying with him and feeling the way I do all the time I get sad and hopeless. I feel cornered. Cutting make it all feel better, suicide sounds comforting. If anyone can relate or has any good advice I am welcome to it."
dsf,"She just said sorry and now she's acting like it's all good. No it's not. i don't feel better anyway. And therefore it's not all good. I feel depressed. That's the result of all the psychological violence. I don't see a reason. Not as in ""I don't want to live anymore"". I'm not that bad. I overslept today. What else can you expect when I haven't slept properly for days. -I- don't want to sleep, I don't need to sleep. Actually I'd rather not sleep. But my body doesn't feel the same. It needs rest. I know it when I feel sick in the middle of class, because I am forcing myself to smile and laugh and not think about what I am thinking of, and trying to stay awake. After school I went to dad's. Again. I ate 'till I got sick, but I didn't throw up. Why can't I just throw up? I think that'd make me feel better. And then I took three cigarettes right in front of him while we were talking about a stupid frame. How can he be that ""gone"". He didn't look at my hands at all. So I smoked three (very strong) cigarettes and felt dizzy and relaxed as hell. But now I'm feeling noxious. I think I like making myself feel awful. But then I hate feeling it when I'm having an OK day. You know? Like I want to feel bad, but when I'm good, it's sucks to still be bad."
dsf,"I'm really new at this, and I'm sure that all of you have your own problems, but i figure who better to ask then other people who might feel the same as i do. I just turned 15 and i have suffered from depression or what i am almost sure is depression for about 4 years now. I have tried telling my parents about it, and they just won't listen, they say that I'm just going through normal teenage stuff, but if this is normal, then i would hate to see what depression is really like. I have attempted suicide before, but i was caught, i have cut my self and I'm trying to stop, i have a boyfriend and a family that loves me, and i know this. But i can't seem to get through to my parents that i need help, i want help, they just don't get it that i am not feeling normal. I really need help, and they won't listen, how am i suppose to get it if they won't listen, recently they found my blades and everything under my bed and they have seen where i have cut before and i don't know if they just don't want to believe it or what, but all of the signs are there for them and they just won't do anything about it. They also found pills that i had been taking and still didn't do anything but ""talk"" to me about it. And my boyfriend, i know he loves me, and i want to tell him about my problem, but i just can't, I'm afraid that he may leave me because of it. and i know that would be all it would take to throw me over the edge and cause me to do something drastic! I'm not sure what to do about any of it, can someone PLEASE PLEASE help me??? my email is xxx i need help and i want help, and if any one else needs help then you can e-mail me and i will help the best that i can!"
dsf,"I find it very hard to make decisions. I know there's a little bit of anxiety behind every decision, but it's starting to control my life. I'm trying to find a new job and a new home. I'm also always thinking about a breakup with my girlfriend of 4.5 years. I know these are big things in my life, which lately has been causing a tremendous amount of anxiety/depression/panic. I'm 32 and I don't think I was raised with the correct tools for dealing with life sometimes. For others it seams so much easier. I'm depressed at my current job/home. I need to change. I'm afraid of change. It's a vicious cycle. Can anyone relate? What works for others?"
dsf,"I've been dealing with severe depression for sometime now, and within recent weeks it has hit its worst (most of my posts were in the MNSEN area): lack of sleep, stress, behind on my work, can't leave my apartment, constant crying, hopeless need, etc. And during these few weeks I have taken the steps into getting into regular therapy again by consulting psych services at my school in conjunction with the counseling I get (or hardly ever get) from my hospital. The severity of my depression has been taking a toll on my friends and last night it seemed to reach its pinnacle. I'm not sure what came over me, I wasn't even drunk, but I started lashing out at a friend of a friend that was at the same party as I was. I started to verbally bully and attack him because he ""annoyed"" me, I don't know why I have so much pent up anger. It rapidly went out of control and before I know it my friends were holding me back and I violently threatened them. For the first time in my life, my best friend (closest friend) had to physically hold me against a wall, almost hitting me, to get me to come down. I just broke down after that, it wasn't even about that stupid guy anymore. I was suddenly overcome with loneliness and fear an jealousy and embarrassment. I've always been known for a very short temper, and my friends all know me to be very emotional, but I have never gotten so violent; I've hit and thrown objects before in anger and frustration but I've never struck someone. Though they all tried to console me that night, I feel even farther away from the few friends that I do have. Everything was hazy from last night, even though I had hardly any to drink... it wasn't so much of an intoxication, but more like a violent breakdown of sorts. I was so angry and I was desperate to physically hurt someone; it was quite a scene since I'm a petite girl starting a fight with a passive aggressive 6 ft male--some laughed it off at first as a Napoleon Complex, but it became serious when they saw how out of it I was. I just remember being so hurt and angry at my friends; I felt so alienated which fueled my anger at the world, at my life more... (As cliche as that sounds). And today I just don't feel like going out and I can't help but feel so alone. The way my friend violently had to restrain me scared me a lot---I've never seen her like that, and she is certainly not the type to behave like that... I pushed her to that point. It brought me back to an ex-bf of mine that I was very close too and who saw the worst of my depression as well; he too at one point had to restrain me violently (against his character as well). After an off and on relationship of trying to stay together, he couldn't take me, or my emotional instability, anymore. Last night, I had friends breaking down screaming at me that they were never enough for me (to make me happy or content otherwise) and it just brought me back to that moment with my ex. I feel as if that this cycle is in all my relationships--romantic ones and friendships. I seem to constantly push people away. I don't know what to do. I don't miss my ex-bf at all, but I'm scared that I will never be able to have close relationships/friendships. Everyone I know just pities me. I feel so completely alone and pathetic."
dsf,"i feel like i keep sinking lower and lower into this depression, and i can't get out from under it.  i keep feeling worse, day by day, i am drifting downwards further into the darkness.  maybe i'm just having a tougher time of it lately, maybe i really am getting sicker, i don't know.  all i do know is how i feel, and i feel like giving up.  i don't want to do anything anymore, i have no desire to do or want a single thing.  i can't live like this.  i just want out, to stop feeling so lethargic and so severely depressed.  It's getting to me a lot more i guess, but i just don't want to be like this anymore.  It's taking me over and swallowing me whole, and i feel like letting it win."
dsf,"Yep - I know this all too well. And it is a sad state of affairs. But you are aware of it. Best you know what is going on than be surprised. SN, I hear what you are saying about not being able to weather another strike against your stability now. And I hope you do not have to go. I will pray with you that you are spared from the cuts this time, but while you are praying and hoping, consider the issue of your personal power. If you are feeling shaky in other areas of life, I doubt that you feel that you have any. I have been in that situation over many things. Remember the difference between what you DO have control over and what you do NOT have control over: you can control the way you approach this job, your punctuality, your diligence, your politeness to other workers; you CANNOT control the decisions made on the top and how they will affect your status. I have been reading a book called ""Corporate Confidential"" by Cynthia Shapiro. She was an HR manager for her whole life and spills the beans on how companies decide who will stay and who will go. It was an eye-opener for me. Perhaps it can help you at this juncture. In your own prayers, remember to ask God not just for the optimal decision to be made on your behalf, but for the power to see where you do and do not have control and for help taking charge of the areas that you actually can control. When you are in a phase of instability, it seems that more and more garbage gets thrown your way. But a turning point comes when the indignation of being tossed on everyone else's sea propels you into action. That turning point came for me about 9 years ago when a really awful roommate had to be ejected. I felt a power I had never felt before - the ability to take charge of my own life, not waiting for someone else's decision to tell me whether I was going to be OK or not. I am trying to find my way back to that point. I hope you do too. It can happen."
dsf,"I have lived with depression since I was little. I was molested by my uncle and a family friend and my dad is in and out of prison all the time (I'm guessing that is where it all started from). Well, when I hit my freshman year in high school, I had no friends because I was so shy. I walked the halls alone, went to lunch alone, sat in the back of the classroom alone. I sat back there fantasizing about suicide and death, and I would cut myself, and I actually planned my suicide. By this point I was so far ""out of my mind"" that I couldn't take it anymore, so I went to my mom. I was diagnosed with severe depression, and I've been in counseling on and off ever since. I am now 18 years old, and I have made friends since, and i even got a boyfriend. Well. I haven't seen my counselor for a while now, and in the past few months I feel like my depression is worse than it has ever been. So many things have been happening to me, that I just can't take it anymore. I lost the friends that I had, and I don't even know why exactly. My boyfriend just broke up with me, after we had been together for two years. I've started to cut myself again. i want to be dead. I know I should go to see my counselor, and i tried to make an appointment, but i feel it's too late. i feel like I'm on the edge of a huge cliff, and if I get pushed just a little more, I'm done. i don't know what to do, I just cant take it anymore! If someone could please just give me some advice I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you, Misty"
dsf,"i know you wouldn't have guessed it by my name i am 18 i have recently become a paraplegic (paralyzed from the chest down) this is down to unbelievable circumstances misdiagnosed several times  misreading of  results and MRI scans i was in a relationship before the injury for 3 years with a lad similar age. i did sport and exercise science at college and was a well known sports person for several different sports. As well as losing the use of my legs and other bodily functions, my boyfriend cheated on me whilst seriously ill i now feel highly vulnerable and lost as my whole life as i once new it has been taken away not only this but my mom within in herself has so much to cope with as well as watching the pain i go through i nearly died 4 times including boxing day and christmas day. i am lucky in the fact i have plenty of friends and family which support me the only problem is no one understands i have always been very strong minded and kept my chin up and  a smile recently as my 18th birthday has just passed i have realized what i have lost, and how i have 2 sit and watch all my friends getting on with life the doctor is always advising me to take my tablets and antidepressants but i choose not to. Although by reading this you will not be able to see how much i have to deal with. i feel as though i am becoming a burden to my family and i really feel i need someone unrelated to my social surroundings to give me a small nudge back to feeling more like myself. i have always had boyfriends before my injury but now it is impossible for me to see myself with anybody again. Due to the fact using the unfortunate words i am now a wheelchair user. can someone please help me."
dsf,"I am not able to do breath meditation myself, so I'm a fine one to talk, but I've read that it works. The thoughts will come, no matter what you do. Supposedly the trick with breath mediation is that it gives you distance on the thoughts, helps you ""stand back"" from them a bit, and feel the accompanying emotions but not get as carried away by them. This reinforces your ability to know that they're just thoughts, and they will go away if you don't act on them. And supposedly either with breath meditation or without, there's an element of ""fake it till you make it"" at work here. It's been shown that ""acting out anger"" as a therapeutic tool actually makes getting angry easier than letting go of it, because it maintains the neurological pathways that anger uses. One meditation teacher calls it ""rehearsing anger"". So supposedly if you replace negative thoughts/feelings with positive ones, like caring for the part of you that is angry and hurt, then eventually your brain will reprogram itself to think and feel positive things. Breath meditation has become a non-religious phenomenon in recent years, like yoga. Three books that are just good reading anyway are ""The Art of Happiness"" by the psychiatrist Howard Cutler with the Dalai Lama, ""Destructive Emotions - How Can We Overcome Them?"", by the psychologist Daniel Goleman with the Dalai Lama, and ""Anger- Wisdom For Cooling The Flames"", by Thich Nhat Hanh, all of which discuss breath meditation as a simple practice for ""mental hygiene"" as opposed to a ""religious practice"" of any sort. Supposedly the Dalai Lama was really surprised to hear that ""self-loathing"" is common in Western culture, because it was so uncommon in Tibet- there was just no concept. The point of all this is, with or without meditation, is that if you notice a negative thought or emotion when it arises, rather than struggle with it to try to put it out of your mind, you should just quietly label it as ""negative thought"" and let it go away, and/or replace it with a positive thought, like ""caring for the wounded child within you"". (It's odd to notice that John Bradshaw, the ""king"" of ""healing the wounded child"", and Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, say the same thing about this.) But it's being said that there's a great similarity between Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and meditation practice, because meditation practice recognizes negative self-talk and replaces it with positive self-talk, and supposedly conditions the brain to react in positive ways. In ""Destructive Emotions"" there's a part about brain imaging that shows that people who meditate are activating more positive parts of their brains. And again, these books are just good reading anyway. But like I say, easier said than done. Supposedly it works for some people. I can't do it, but some people can. Maybe you can. If nothing else, all these works, including Bradshaw, are good reading and you may be able to develop positive mental habits and replace the negative mental habits with them. Both breath meditation and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy have been shown to be good adjuncts to recovery from depression, even if the depression itself is being treated with medication."
dsf,"I got up and realized I had not given my diabetic shot that I need to give at night. Therefore, my readings were off the chart, and I don't feel well. I hate this! I am trying to get my diabetes on track but i can't. I hate feeling as if I am so stupid that I can't control what my body does. I didn't get much sleep, I didn't have breakfast, I have a headache, I am getting sick, I didn't do well in a competition on Sunday that everyone that I would do well in, my grades in school are going down and grades are due Wednesday (let me know when I'm rambling!) and I have to be in school because its MONDAY. Top it off with trying to stop cutting and I have a very crappy morning to start out my week with. Anyone else every have a morning like this. I don't know what to do because I have to around people and I don't like people when I have mornings like this. Tell me, do these mornings get any better as the day goes on? Does anyone else have mornings like this, where all you want to do is stay in your room under the covers and read. Hmmmm. Well, school bell is going to ring. I'm glad I got this off my chest, but it didn't help as much as I had hoped. Anybody have any suggestions for making a bad day better?"
dsf,"i'm not really sure what i want to say here. I was sexually abused by my brother from the age of 4 until i was about 17. He hung himself when i was 20. i'm 34 now and just finding it hard to get a handle on life. I never really thought of what happened to me as being a big deal but my partner has made me think again about what happened in the past. my most formative years were disrupted and i believe i am still suffering as a result.

I suppose i am just wondering if anyone has any advice or knows of anyone who was in a similar situation. I am in counseling at the moment and am just starting to face my demons. I came off my depression / anxiety medications. i felt they were stopping me from really feeling and i felt i needed to be fully aware of my feeling in order to work through this and be able to let go. at the moment i don't see an end to all this."
dsf,"I'm in a reflective mood today. I received a phone call this afternoon from the sister of my old neighbor, who I will call Alice. She had passed away this morning. Alice had been fighting terminal colon cancer since March and after harsh chemo therapy and a bout with pneumonia that landed her in the ICU, she decided that enough was enough. She stopped treatment just around the July 4th weekend. I'm not too exact on the details, but suffice it to say that she failed quickly after that and passed away in her sleep this morning surrounded by family and friends. She was only 52. As I struggle with Depression, AD/HD, tic disorders, sleep apnea, insomnia, food allergies, pollen allergies, and a weak immunity system I sometimes feel that life is unfair. I used to say that the Universe was out to get me, that God's having his little joke with me. I suppose it's only natural to feel that way. It's a full plate and I'm not too hungry for what's on the menu. Then I encounter other people with other hardships and I see that life itself is not fair to an awful lot of people. Life is, in fact, a lousy chef. What struck me as sad today, however, was not simply the passing of somebody I knew. Instead I was struck with my own mortality and weakness. Let me explain. Alice and some other neighbors hadn't been too kind to me when I moved into the area. They had accused me of various deviant behaviors that to this day still anger me. These were supposed to be my Christian brothers and sisters and instead they wielded stones. The rumors mounted as the months progressed, wilder and wilder, until they reached a crescendo where they became so outlandish that it was easy to disprove them. When all the furor amounted to nothing a lot of people were left with egg on their face. That summer several of the families involved moved away. I have unresolved issues with them, but with Alice, my neighbor, I was able to find forgiveness in my heart. The story didn't end happily there with us arm in arm, though. Alice never really apologized to me, though her behavior towards my family and myself became kinder. Unfortunately, she was one of the people I knew who didn't believe in AD/HD. One day she told me her opinion on the subject right to my face after I mentioned I had it. I was so stunned by her bold opinion that I stood there slack jawed. I swore that day I would never let that happen to me again. You see a bit of that fire in this blog whenever anybody accuses me of not having a ""real"" problem. I am as fierce in person as well. Thanks to Alice. And now she's passed on. Suddenly my anger feels petty and shallow. She moved away and now has died, but I allowed her to change me. I nursed a wound like an angry coal in my heart. I forgave her for one thing, but held a grudge for another. She became representative of all the doubters in my life and I used that as impetus for change. What type of person does that make me? On top of that, I have set lofty goals for myself that are proving hard to meet. Time is ticking and my 40th birthday is but a scant five months away. One of the byproducts of meeting those goals was to have a book with my name on it that I could bring into her elementary school classroom one day, slam on her desk, and say ""Ha!"" - as if my success would mean anything to her. As if that would prove my struggle with AD/HD was real. How silly. How foolish. Alice was only thirteen years older than I. I can blink and be 52 tomorrow. Mortality laughs at me and replaces all of life's menu items with sour grapes and rotten eggs. What shall I order now? Usually, my sense of humor keeps my spirits alight. Today, however, I see myself as being revealed as a small-minded man with insignificant goals. That even for a moment, no matter how miniscule, I was sad she died before my goals were met... This both sickens me and splashes me in the face with a brisk dose of reality. December looms and I read news? Time leaks through my fingers and I'm worried about a drop in comments on my blog? How did I get so turned around? Where did I get so terribly sidetracked? I need to remember what it is I want out of life. It is not to show up the doubters but to find joy in my own accomplishments. I know that, but negative thought attaches itself to our most noble intentions like a parasite. Allow it to stay too long and it consumes and replaces what was once good and uplifting. I don't resent Alice. I never wished her ill. But I regret I let myself hold a grudge, however slight it seemed. Life is too short for such things. So I will allow Alice to change me again. That way when I order from the menu of life it will not be just desserts."
dsf,"I'm new to the forum and this is the most interesting thread I've found so far. I'm in my mid fifties and have suffered from depression for as long as I can remember. It's got a lot worse lately. I've been an ""underachiever"" because of it, but now I've slowly lost just about everything. I've been on Prozac, Effexor, etc., and I'm now on Zispin. This latest one makes me sleep a lot. I couldn't get up for work even if I could hold down a job. I've gone from being a successful business man to losing wife, estranging my kids and grand kids, I'm unemployed, out of money and running out of hope. It's time that depression in men was seen as the problem it really is. How many of us are performing so far below what we are intellectually, physically and emotionally capable of? It's not just a personal problem. It's a problem for our families and friends and I believe it robs our society of a lot of valuable people. Here's hoping that there really is a solution out there somewhere."
dsf,"Ok I have a couple of questions...I guess. 1st is I finally managed to make myself an appointment with a psychiatrist (it's not till May). Now I'm having second thoughts about it. I just pretty much want to go in for an evaluation (to see if there is a problem) and see if maybe there is a short term solution for the suicidal thoughts I've been having. I've got a summer job I'm leaving for in June and than I'm moving to another city after that. (So basically something till I'm stable with where I'm living and job). I assume I'm only going to be able to see 1 doctor, 1 time before than. So 2nd thoughts have been should I just wait to see someone when I actually get settled. Also if a psychiatrist is who I want to see (I've never been to anyone before for my mental health)...that's what the intake coordinator suggested. Also I was wondering if they could hospitalize you for suicidal thoughts without your permission? Ok now on to the suicidal thoughts questions (and just so people know I do not feel myself to be in any immediate or near immediate danger to myself). One main thing is does depression have to be present for suicidal thoughts/actions? I often find my mind turns more to thoughts of suicide and death when I feel relatively normal mood wise. And that when I have feel really depressed the thought of suicide rarely crosses my mind (but the pain is more severe). I guess that's really all I have. Sorry if the topic is inappropriate for this forum. I just wanted to ask...and maybe discuss with someone...but don't really feel that it's a problem for me right now. If someone wants to talk in PMs I wouldn't mind either."
dsf,Hi. My name is Jenna. I'm 20 years old and just joined and figured that I should introduce myself. I found this site from searching online and think that it's great. I only started accepting the fact that I've been depressed last year because I've always been very good at hiding it from everyone else and I used to fool myself as well (if that makes sense). I've never been one to seek help from others because in the past I've always dealt with everything myself. The start of college and being outside (different state) of my home environment (which is the cause of a lot of anger and resentment that I also have) helped me to see that there was something wrong with the way that I was living and that I could reach out and get help. I'm currently seeing a counselor (through my college and since I feel like I'm working well with her that I don't need to seek other outside help yet) about my anxiety and depression but I feel that talking to others that are going through the same thing could help give me a different view on everything and be helpful as well. I'm glad that I stumbled across these forums and I can't wait to get to know some of you. Jenna
dsf,"I'm a 17 year old female from Ontario. When I was 12, my mom's boyfriend at the time raped me for six months every time I was there. When my dad finally got wind of the situation, my mom's boyfriend was taken to court and charged with molestation. I didn't attend the trial. I recently found out that molestation is only ""unwanted touching"" as my friend told me, and wouldn't have included most of what happened. I recently asked my mom what was brought up in court, and it was only 6 counts of molestation, meaning, they only knew of 6 different times where he had touched me and included nothing of what I went through. I now suffer from ptsd. due to it. I have never spoken to anyone about it before. I don't know how to deal with the sense of loss I feel about the situation. I now cut because of it and have terrible nightmares.

dsf,"Thank You ArtChick and Tempesta , all of you who have been here for me. I'm so glad that you all understand. I really want to get out from behind this trapped door. My life is so controlled and he doesn't even see it. He denies it when i bring it up. I cry because i can't buy things for my children or grandchildren. This isn't the way it is suppose to be. One of the reasons I don't make it to church on some Sundays is because I don't have clothes to wear. I have a pair of black jeans i keep switching jackets and shirts so i don't look the same every Sunday. My daughter bought me a nice dress and it was warm enough last Sunday to wear it. I guess i shouldn't care about what people think and all the people at my church are wonderful, not judgmental. I do go to the Lord in Prayer every morning and study my Bible. I feel content because we are supposed to give all our worries to him and not get in his way of taking care of them. I know God is working in my life, my daughter finding this site is just one of the ways i know. my husband just got a job after being out of work for a year. I prayed for that too. He didn't just get a job but he got a good job. I told him he didn't get it on his own. I know I am going to get better eventually. Thank all of you for being here for me. I will keep all of you in my prayers too."
dsf,"(I am 39) I say this to myself all the time, SJW...I never thought I would be in this position....but I am...and so are you...I can relate to you on many levels. If I did not work for my father I am sure I would be unemployed...due to my concentration problems, ATTENDANCE problems, uneven mood and unpredictable production level...so I am very lucky. I can see what challenges you face. I often thought that I might like to go into some sort of counseling because of my life experiences also. Do you live in a big enough city that you can apply at some mental health clinics or government aid departments? Sometimes the willingness to do that kind of work can get you in the door. It may be entry level, but you could work up if it were a job that satisfied your needs. What about like an activity director at a youth home, or a retirement village/senior home, or a special needs program? Here our recreation commission has a special populations program that coordinates trips and activities for the special population of the area. They go on ski trips and day trips and it looks very fun! Of course it takes a certain frame of mind to be able to work with the special population of the world. But I just mention it because you talked about counseling... I just wanted to clarify that although I am very lucky to have an income, it really fuels my depression sometimes to think about ""how I am letting my dad down"" or causing him extra crap to deal with...so lucky and not so lucky."
dsf,"I would like to say hello to everyone, I have bipolar and was doing a bit of research into my illness, which I have not done before as I have always denied having the illness. I do have funny story to tell. A few years ago now I lost the plot and lost my home wife and children as a result. Not that funny but at the time I did not know I had bipolar. New life spending loads of money racing up the career ladder (on a High) I meet this fantastic girl. We went on holidays together had some great times. After a year or two I moved in with this girl gave up my good job and planned a future for us both marriage extra. There was one thing holding us back we both hard bipolar and never told each other about or illness as we thought this could change everything. As you can imagine if she when on a high I went on a low , and when I went on a high starting companies and buying things I could not afford she would go on a low. Our relationship did not last for much longer as she would self harm and I would attempt suicide. It wasn't until I went into hospital that it all came out in the open. We are still friends but both agree that two bipolar people do not match. My doctor did smile and we did laugh about it. Anyway I am new and just want to say hi to everyone."
dsf,"Not so tired anymore. Left work at eight, didn't do the late night. I couldn't, I still felt a little ill, felt a bit dizzy around seven Never a good sign. So I went home to find that two TV shows are trying to kill me. I watched the finales of Small Ville and Bones and bloody 'ell. I love Bones. I'm not enjoying Cold Case anymore. It's just getting same and boring. I might have to stop watching it. Stop watching a TV show! Oh the horror! I'm getting a tattoo tomorrow, a star and rainbow combo on my left shoulder/back area. That's really vague isn't it. When I get it done I will take a photo and everything will be cleared up. I'm having it done in another new tattoo parlor. New to me anyway. The three I have at the moment have all been done by different blokes in different shops. What else? Nothing really. I love my new camera, it's a Fujifilm E900. It's pretty strong so I can run around and shake it and it should be okay. Should be, I have a tendency to break stuff. For my sins I'm on the fourth Harry Potter book now. I read the third in a day and I'm over half way through this way. What's worse is that I'm really enjoying them, though, it's nice just to be reading again. It's so hard to read nowadays and this is a good sign for me."
dsf,"I would love to talk about dreams. Only thing is for every dream, there can be a hundred interpretations. Or so has been my experience. I always say that I will keep paper and pen next to me at night, so when I have a dream I want to remember (like last night)... I'll write it down so I won't forget. But I don't do this because when I wake up I think I can remember...no problem! After all, a lot of these dreams are so profound that how could I possibly forget them... guess what??? I almost always forget the words that meant so much to me in the dream. I remember the subject matter, but it's the words many times that I want to remember. So here goes my dream from last night (or early this morning)... A little background first for those who don't know or remember who I am... my mother died quite suddenly from her leukemia in April 2004. We were at odds with each other at the time. I started taking care of my elderly father at the time and he died this past August 2005. I've been wanting to dream about my mother and feel her presence and love since she died. I've only had a few dreams about her, maybe 4... And they have all been upsetting, never ""nice feeling"" dreams. Last night I had a dream of my mother. She was pregnant and ready to deliver her baby. She looked younger (she was almost 82 at her death) but in the dream ""we"" knew she was older like she was alive today. She said ""I'm ok now I'm going to have a baby At least I think this is what she said. My dad was in my dream as was my dad's cousin, who is also deceased. My mother's cousin-in-law was in the dream and she was sobbing. This same woman was crying out of control at my mother's funeral. We were at a hotel in Disneyland. Ok everyone. What does this mean?"
dsf,"I am 18 years old.  I moved out of my house in with my boyfriend when I was 17.  We had known each other for a year and then started going out.  We bought a place and moved in together two weeks after going out.  We both just wanted to get out of our houses.  Well 2 months later we found out that i was pregnant with our son cameron.  We then had him on christmas day of 2005.  I love my son and i love my fiance, but only being 18 i feel trapped.  My fiance who will be 21 in april also has md (muscular dystrophy).  I have to help take care of him, the house, our 2 month old son, and i work.  Only being 18 i feel so overwhelmed.  My fiance and i have had a lot of problems.  I don't feel like he appreciates me.  When we are alone and the baby is over at a grandparent's house all we do is sit at home watching tv.  He just doesn't understand that i need to get out and do stuff.  We fight constantly about the same thing.  I need romance, I need to feel appreciated, I need to feel that something is about me, and I need the feeling of being loved.  I know my fiance loves me and i love him but how do i get him to understand that i need a life outside of being a fiance and a mother?"
dsf,"Just a little update - my temporary $8 an hour job was the foot in the door I needed. Two weeks later and I'm on day one of a higher paying, with benefits, permanent job with these people. Granted it's still in the same agency as my last job down here, but different division. It's good though that I can just walk down the street during lunch and have lunch with the girls from my old office. I did miss them and their good gossip. By my birthday in September we'll all be in the same building, we move in August and they do on my birthday, so that'll be fun! While I was pregnant I was sure I'd want to be a stay at home mom. After having Toby I thought I did then as well... 6 months later and I was dying to get out of the house and back to work. I do miss him but I don't envy my husband's job of taking care of him and the house and our pacifier business while I get rest at work. I get to have lunch, take my time and go to the bathroom when I need to, and talk to real adults about non baby stuff in non baby speak. And the best part - I'm getting out of the house! And I have a reason to not wear pajamas all day. I also really do appreciate my time with Toby more. I don't see it as a chore anymore. Phew."
dsf,"I was sexually, physically, and emotionally abused by my father, my uncle and my grandparents from the time I was five until I was fifteen. My mother had taken my father and his family to court for it but everyone said that she made me say it to get back at my father, since I was ""only five"" and ""not old enough to know anything."" None of them were punished for it and I had to keep seeing them on visitations until I was sixteen (i'm still sixteen) and I told my dad I didn't want to see him anymore. This obviously did not make him happy and he knows it is about the abuse. Every once and awhile he emails me or calls and tries to make me feel guilty about it and when he does I get upset all over again just when I had started to seem to get better. I really wanted to write a book about my life, but I figured that because my dad and his family wasn't punished or proven guilty that I'd be sued for it. I want to change my last name and then get a pen name, but my mom says I have to wait until I am eighteen. I don't exactly want to wait that long to write my book, but I feel like I don't have a choice. I've considered taking them back to court but I figured it's probably hopeless and I feel guilty and doubtful even though I know it happened. Anyways, I don't want to put my mom through all that again. A lot of times I think that I imagined it all and deny it because I wish it didn't happen. I really want to be a writer and to help people who've been abused, but without proving my abusers guilty I feel as if this is impossible, that it isn't my right. I'm scared they'd be found innocent and then try to kill me for taking them to court. What should I do? I know everyone here is having a hard time and I really don't mean to be a bother. I feel guilty just talking about it because there are so many others who've had the same thing happen to them but I really needed advice."
dsf,"I've suffered from depression episodes for about 10 years. Lately, due to major stresses at work, I'm back into feeling awful. I'm a good employee and have hidden my depression episodes well in the past but now I'm terrified that my new boss, whom I hate, will find out and fire me. I'm working double time to not be seen as weak and incompetent. I can't afford to get fired but am terrified that that my boss will use anything to get me fired. The stress of trying to be professional at all times at my job is just about killing me. It makes me so angry. When other employees have physical illness, such as cancer or heart problems my employer rallies around them and makes all sorts of accommodations but I've kept my depression a secret because I'm afraid it will be seen as a character flaw and I'll be fired. Plus I'm so paranoid, I'm sure when I come into work each day, I'll be escorted off the premises and I don't know what I'll do. Any advice from those of you who have been terrified of being discovered."
dsf,"this is my first post.  I am 27, 5 and a half months pregnant dealing with depression / anxiety.  I have taken antidepressants off and on for a few years but stopped this summer because my husband and I were trying to conceive.  My pregnancy has been pretty rough this time around ... (I have an 8 year old son).  I've had joint problems, severe morning sickness ... and terrible depression / anxiety.  My husband just doesn't understand what I'm going through ... he thinks that I'm being hateful or sad on purpose.  He contributes to a lot of the way that I feel.  He told me early in the pregnancy, that if something was to happen and I lose the baby or it was born with something wrong with it, he would have a hard time not blaming me for it even if the doctor said that nothing could have prevented it.  This was said to me because I wasn't taking my prenatal vitamins at the time because of the morning sickness.  I could see if I were using drugs or drinking but I do not do those things.  I don't understand his thinking on that subject.

My mother in law is another person getting on my nerves.  She comes over uninvited and gives out unwanted advice.  She also has a way of making me angry with her thoughtless comments which are hurtful and unnecessary.  I can't talk to my husband about this because he would see me as the ""bad guy"".  Sometimes I just want to be alone ... away from people ... I feel like I don't have any privacy anymore.  My husband always makes me feel worse when I talk to him about how I feel.  I don't know why he aggravates me to talk to him then always says .... ""Well, you ought to be thankful ... rrblah rrblah rrblah"".  It isn't like I don't know that I could have it worse ... but he never cares what I feel at that moment.  I guess I better shut up ... I have ranted long enough ... although I feel like I could go on forever ... so sorry for the long post ..."
dsf,"I am a 42 year old woman who is single and has no one ""special"" in my life.  I am becoming my disgusted with my life and where I am.  I really want to make 2006 my year.  Yes I have said that every year since I turned 18.  I am at the lowest point that I didn't want to reach.  I am afraid to sink any lower.

I am currently on effexor and linispril.  Effexor is started to have a negative effect on my heath, but I am so afraid of returning night terrors that I'm afraid to allow my doctor to change it.

I am seeing a counselor but he isn't working on my cognitive behavior.  I need someone to tell me positive things and to help me believe that I am not bad.  He just seems to repeat what I say.  I had someone before who focused on my thought patterns and it helped greatly."
dsf,"Hi. I'm new, and I'm not really sure where to start in the forums! I've been treated for depression since I was 17 years old, and then misdiagnosed with ADD when I was 17 and that started a downward spiral with abusing Ritalin (snorting about 5-10 times my dosage) for about 5 years. That's over with. I battled with anorexia as a direct result of the Ritalin, and got down to 95 lbs. Then I ballooned up to 185 lbs. I lost 45 lbs. a few years ago and I've kept it off ever since (I've never gone above 144). I've been on Prozac since I was 17, and just recently switched to Cymbalta at the suggestion of my psychiatrist. I felt funny on it, and committed the ultimate sin: I stopped taking my medicines a week ago. I know that's bad. The last two days have been a nightmare, and I even contemplated swallowing a bottle of pills at one point. My fiance is the most amazing person in the world, and I'm literally killing him with my sickness. I don't know what to do. I've been hysterically crying and inconsolable for about a week. Yesterday my fiance called the psychiatrist on-call with our medical program, and she said I needed to take the Cymbalta, so I did take one pill yesterday and again this morning. I do feel weird, though. At the center of it all is my weight gain; I gained about 10ish pounds (I weigh 140 at the moment), and NONE of my clothes fit me. I feel like a disgusting fat blob all of the time. Just one look in the mirror sets me off and I'm HYSTERICAL for the rest of the day. All I want to do is sleep. SLEEP and never wake up. I've had an eating disorder in the past, and I know I can't fall back into it (the anorexia was a direct result of the Ritalin), but I am just hysterical, depressed, and I feel disgusting all day long. My clothes don't fit and I feel fat and disgusting and horrible and I want to cry and rip out my hair. I'm thinking this weight has a LOT to do with my recent downward turn in my depression, but I just can't lose the weight. I work out constantly and follow a really healthy/strict eating plan, and nothing is working. I'm just reaching the end of my rope, here. And to top it all off: I'm getting married next month. I need help...I've called my psychiatrist, but I don't know what to do. I don't see a psychologist; I think I need to, but I've had bad experiences in the past. I think I just need help and guidance and a way to lose this weight and feel good about myself. Hoping this forum will help."
dsf,"Hey, I guess this is the place to post this. I don't really know if I'm depressed and if I am I'm not sure how to go about getting help for it so I figured you guys would be able to help me out a bit. For the past year and a bit I've been feeling really out of sorts, pretty down and kind of lost in general. I left school in July 2004 and started a year out before I went to university. That's when I started feeling strange and I put it down to (and still believe it was) just a weird kind of feeling when one leaves school and their life changes forever and it's the beginning of being an adult which is a scary time for anyone. Over the year I'd go through different stages where for a few months I'd feel really positive and enjoy spending time with people and then for a few months I'd feel lonely and sad and not go out with friends for months on end. Then I went to university in September 2005 and felt very very sad. I think it was the shock of leaving home, living away from everyone I'd ever known and also the feeling of being back at school. I knew immediately that I'd made a terrible decision starting university, it wasn't what I wanted to be doing with my life and for the 6 weeks I was there I would stay in bed pretty much all day and not eat much. I think I lost about a stone and a half and even now, 3 months after dropping out and moving back home I'm still half a stone lighter than I was last summer. So now I'm back at home and I've started a job cleaning tables in a cafe where I got on with the people I work with and I'm back in the same city as my girlfriend again and things should be ok but I keep dropping into really low moods.  A few weeks ago I thought that maybe it was depression and so I took some tests on the internet with what seem to be the basic questions. I tried to answer as truthfully as possible, you have to understand that depression is not something I want to have, I've known too many silly teenagers who think that having depression makes them interesting to other people and so they exaggerate emotions to try and look sad to find it appealing. So even though I found myself answering questions that I knew were making me seem depressed I answered the anyway because it was the truth. Things like a lowered libido, I find myself wanting to have sex with my girlfriend far far less frequently than I used to and to be honest a lot of the time when I'm having sex I feel that I'm just going through the motions. My sleeping which has always been a little odd has become increasingly erratic and I've found myself thinking about death a lot. To be honest though I thought that everyone thought about death and dying and that it was natural. I fin myself becoming very easily bored with people and situations and where I once used to enjoy writing stories I can't being myself to do it anymore. The worst thing though is the mood swings I have and the low moods I find myself in quite frequently. When I feel like this I don't want to be around anyone or have anyone talk to me and I can't stop myself thinking about bad things that have happened to me or could happen on a personal level and making myself the centre of blame for them. So am I depressed or is it just, as I'm leaning towards, a natural part of growing up and finding myself in the world of work and adulthood and trying to adjust to it. And if I am depressed how do I stop myself being this way? The thought of going to my doctor and sitting there and saying ""I think I'm depressed"" doesn't make much sense to me. I've always thought that with problems of that nature you must be told that you're ill and not decide for yourself that you are. Sorry if this has been very long and poorly punctuated, I wrote it all fairly stream of consciously. Any help at all would be very much appreciated, I'm feeling pretty vulnerable and down right now and don't want to feel this way anymore."
dsf,"It goes by a few names ..... a spiritual eclipse ... the black hole .... the shadow .... my own prison ... the downward spiral.
I've named it a lot of different things ... like it has a life of its own.
In a way it does .... my life.
For too long and too completely.
It's getting better but at times it seemed it couldn't be much worse ... unless I did the unthinkable ...  at least most of the time it's unthinkable.
Divorced for a little over a year know ... removed from a wife I came to realize was a classic borderline personality (look it up) ... I never realized how far down I was on the ladder of life and spirit until I got away from the witch / queen.
A true chameleon who changed and kept me guessing and off balance for 18 years .. never knowing who to expect.
Finally starting to figure it out ... I think.
Two DWI's since the split in rapid succession and then finding out I was self medicating without realizing it.
No license for the last 10 months (2 to go) and recovering emotionally and financially with Mom and Dad. Thank God someone cares.
Two children I had to leave with the Queen of misery because of the threat of false allegations against me if I dared to go for custody.
Hungry and lonely for someone to just be nice to me and care about me  ... at least a little bit ... I find myself in my own prison having to acknowledge the fact ""Why would anyone want to have anything to do with me?""
Hard to accept, but the truth ... too much baggage ... my ex's baggage she handed off to me to spare herself her own truth.
At times I wished I could just flip a switch and just go away.
Times I thought about driving into a bridge abutment or into a truck at the last second.
Absolutely crazy stuff.
I can now see what was so logical at that time to be so desperate from too much pain suffered by the abuser she was.
I can now see the so called glimmer or hint of a silver lining in the most simple of things life offers to everyone each and everyday.
Thank God ....... finally.
Things will get better and hopefully someday great.
I keep trying remind myself things could be a lot worse.
Two great healthy kids who love me and miss me terribly.
I'm their entire world. I now realize that.
That alone has kept me ""here"".
Realizing now that I've been lost in that vortex of hell tugging at me for years ...
I actually want to keep going on to life's next challenge.
That spells hope and progress in itself.
I've made it this far after going through hell with her ... why stop know when things are just starting to look up

dsf,"I'm going to start with the apology. To all my friends here, and everyone is, whether you've read anything I've written or not, I am so sorry that I have not been able to offer you support. I get into your threads, and the words just don't come. Sometimes the best I can do is just a hi, I was here. I'll start the explanation, but this thread may take me a week or so to finish, as I hate long posts, and it's so much effort to try and find the words. I am in major trouble at work. I'm to blame, although someone I thought was a friend, complained about me - I don't do enough work, don't work fast enough, and do not work efficiently or accurately enough, and she complained to the right person. Let's get out of chronological order. Due to weird circumstances, I went for about 3 months without medicines, and therapy. In November, I was at the bottom of a deep, dark pit, so called my psychiatrist, Barry. Surprising for me, I went back with a new, improved attitude. We'd had a couple of productive sessions when annual reviews came out. I called him for advice, and thought that while the advice he offered was good, that he was not being supportive at all. I actually thought about how to discuss with him how his response made me feel, rather than just shut him out. We had a couple of excellent sessions, which apparently told him that something had triggered defensive coping skills, and where my mind actually was. Can't write anymore tonight, other than, Scarlet, hang in there, you're in for the ride of your life. You truly are going to be a fabulous mother, trust me. Jill, that snail-mail card almost gave me a heart attack. You are beyond awesome, that you could reach out to me in the midst of your own problems. I will write, appropriately. Tiny, thank you.

I don't know how to deal with this anymore. This last year has been the worst (mood problem - wise). I used to have longer periods of relative normalcy in between episodes, but they seem to be happening more frequently this past year. It's too much to deal with.

I am getting treatment and seeing a doctor, but nothing seems to work that great for me. My doctor probably thinks I'm faking it all at this point. I don't really think she has experience treating anything but very mild depression or anxiety.

everything is going downhill and i can't seem to stop it. I've been thinking more and more about self harm again. i can't help it. i just can't take it all anymore.

 

i guess i just had to tell someone. someone who will understand and not be judgmental and just say, don't do that again, as it isn't as easy as that as I'm sure you all know.

dsf,"I am  61 and for almost two years have been dealing with anxiety. It is strange the way of hitting and I would like to know from some of you experts if it is typical GAD.

For almost two years I have been awakened almost every day at about 5:30 out of sound sleep with this feeling of anxiety. At first it hit my spine, now my stomach. If I take a xanax it will dissipate and not bother me much until later in the day. Again, no matter what I am doing I can feel it start to build, take a xanax and go on with life. By late afternoon it is gone and doesn't return until the next day.

During this period my thyroid has been going haywire, probably from four surgeries in four years, the last being two months ago...a total knee repacement.. About sox weels before this surgery, after changing my thyroid meds a bit, the anxiety had left me. I was fine through the operation and then about three weeks after, it was back!

Before the operation I was beginning to get some real bouts of rolling depression but they are gone for now ... just anxiety. The thing that I question is that it is the same no matter what is or has happened in my life for the day. I can have a great, relaxed day or a hectic, chaotic day and the next day will be exactly the same. My environment doesn't seem to affect it. Is all of this typical of GAD or should I redress my thyroid or other hormonal screw ups? Thanks for reading. It's really getting me down!"

It makes me feel worse that this is been going on for so long that even the pathetic depressive coping skills have no effect on me. Pure pessimism, not even the chance of some temporary relief through an OD or spilt blood. Why did they seem to offer relief 3, 5, 6 years ago? I tried to eat normally today, I really tried. I failed though. I am trying to see myself properly, or at least come to the realization that I am not vile and unattractive, and obese. It still ends up with food all over the toilet. I disgust myself so much. I disgust myself because I let myself eat. I disgust myself because I think as I do, and I know that eating should be considered normal, but I can't see it like that. I disgust myself because I covered the toilet bowl in bits of chewed up food and stomach acid. I don't know what to say any more. I wish some one would say that I am going to feel better, but I've had that for the last 7 years, and I'd probably just be cynical any way. This post was pathetic, I'm sorry. Ruth"

my two teenage kids in bed, my bloke away at his kids for weekend, I want to cry, but can't anymore. Don't want to bring anyone down with my feelings but so lonely at moment.
life has nothing new to offer me and it seems so easy to leave it all, but how can I when i have two beautiful kids upstairs. Can't do that to them, and that's why i feel so low. hate life, always have. feel comfortable in depression after a while and that's when i get to point of not caring who i hurt. had several episodes through teens and adult life, drink used to help, unemployment let me be selfish, being single mom meant i didn't have to explain my feelings, but this is first episode since been with partner of 3 years. he won't understand, and i just dread tomorrow when he comes home.

We started dating and it turned out we and tons of similar interests and very similar morals. A few days after we started dating she told me that she was going to australia to study abroad for 10 months, weeks later she told me she was afraid to lose me I told her we would worry about it when the time comes. Since then we have had some really great times doing things we both love together. Yesterday we finally had the discussion of what was going to happen when she left. In my mind I was hopeful that we could maintain this relationship despite the obvious obstacles. I told her I cared about her more than anyone I have ever dated and said that I wish we had a chance together. She told me she doesn't believe in long distance relationships, this kind of broke my heart but at the same time I knew it was the logical choice in this situation. She told me that she did not want to cut me out of her life and that she wanted to stay in contact with me. She also said that if it was meant to be that it will happen for us. My family has been very hesitant about our relationship because they worry about me spiraling downward when she leaves. I am a little worried about myself as well, today I cried on the way to school and during my break between classes. She leaves in 6 days and she still wants to see me as much as possible before she leaves. I am so afraid to lose her and scared of how I will feel when she is gone. Please help."

I have been taking 100 mil of Elavil at bedtime which is also an antidepressant but I take it to help me sleep. It used to help control my depression but it doesn't anymore and really doesn't help me sleep either. Have you ever tried Lexapro? I think it's the best SSRI one can be on and I had no side effects while taking it so you might want to ask your doctor about it. If there is an alternative treatment for major depression I would like to know what it is. I really have no reason to be depressed as I have a very loving, supportive husband 4 wonderful children, 10 grandchildren and 6 great-grand children. Both my husband and I are retired and this is a time when I should really be enjoying my life but there is a void which I can't explain. I don't want for anything. I have a beautiful home, a new Durango but the material things aren't what makes one happy. I've been told that one chooses to be happy or unhappy but I certainly don't choose to be unhappy and I don't know anyone who would. I am a devout Christian and I know that my depression isn't coming from God but I'm letting the Devil tell me that I'm depressed. Maybe God is just trying to bring me closer to Him and I need to lay my burden of depression at His feet and tell him that I can't get through this alone, then just forget about it but for me it isn't that easy. Three of my 4 children are taking antidepressants so I guess depression might be hereditary (spelling?). I will pray for you to feel better and will you please pray for me too? Thank you."
dsf,"Ok, sometimes i feel so pathetic because i have these friends who are pretty and could have any guys they want but they don't really care about getting married, and here i am ugly and that's all i can think about. I don't know why but i feel like there is some kind of pressure on me to get married. Because my cousins, who are like my brothers, both left home before they graduated and started dating younger girls so i feel like I'm a failure b/c i still don't have a boyfriend and I'm almost 16.I'm not sure if they really think that or if i just imagine it but either way that makes me want to hurt myself but then I'm like what good would that do me and if my arms and legs are all messed up then guys will definitely (spelling) hate me. I don't get why i care so much but i do. I want to be happy with my life and to be happy with what i got but i don't know how i always think that if i just forget about not having a guy in my life that i will be happier and maybe even eventually get one but it doesn't work but i don't know what i should do. So if you have any ideas please tell me ."
dsf,"Hi, after 2 posts on the DF I'm finally beginning to work out the format. Excuse the typo's as going through Prozac withdrawals and kind of shaky! I'm 27 years old, I live in the UK, Studied psychology, trained psychiatric nurse, behavior family therapist, and trainee CB therapist. Not sure if I can go back to my CBT course as I have missed so much time from university due to my current episode. This is my worst episode ever. I have had depression for 8 years, and have been ashamed and embarrassed by it. As my life seems to be ebbing away, I have come out with it and seeking psychiatric help. My problem has been that I work in psychiatry and have feared loosing my job/career. It means everything to me. It's the only thing I have and couldn't bare seeing it go down the toilet. Friends don't understand and know how to discuss the topic with me. My family doesn't know as it would devastate an already broken family. For 8 years I've suffered in silence, cried silent screams, been tormented by my own brain. I hate imagining living a life like this especially when the long term effects I'm reminded of every day (my patients). The only person I had was my ex girlfriend, we split last year. CAUSE? me. Stress got the better of me, my thinking became screwed and I've lost her, for life. She was the only one I could talk to, some one I had known for, 12 odd years. Depression has ruined my life. This episode has been an eye opener. This is the first time planet earth is hearing about my struggle. Something, which may have otherwise been lost. My secrets buried with me. Don't confuse this as a suicide note. It isn't. It's me talking about things in this way for the first time. I'm over the crisis point but nowhere near my usual self and need to sort my medicines out with my doctor as soon as possible. I've had a brave chat with my boss who is going to sort out a psychiatrist in the next 10 days, all being well. I have only taken one OD in 1998 with a serious intent to kill myself. Doctors said I survived as I woke up. For years I've avoided talking about it, never wanted to see a psychiatrist but realize now (well for now) that there is 2 people inside me. One is me, the other is depression and to stand the best chance of staying well and keeping well then I need to face I have a problem. Around 3 weeks ago I was so actively suicidal, I was thinking of jumping off a bridge into the river, i searched the internet for ways to kill myself. I'm out of that acute phase but don't trust myself. I have tried SSRIs but they just don't agree with me so it looks like I'm going back on Mirtazapine. I stopped taking it sometime ago as I put on weight. Since last year I've lost 2 stone through diet and exercise. In the last 3 weeks I've lost 4 lbs as a result of depression. Right now my mind's blank. I've never chatted to anyone on this forum before but I know you guys know what I'm going through. My life has never been the same since 1998. It never will be. My dad died in 2002 since then things have worsened. I have so much to say I could write on but going to leave it for now. You guys are the first to hear my full (well pretty full) story. I have never had the courage to speak like this before. Bye for now"
dsf,I am a 26 year old female that has had depression since i could remember i started cutting myself in high school and stopped when i graduated with very few relapses but for the past year i have been wanting to i just recently had a son who is my pride and joy but my son is the only thing that i have in my life.  his father is not around and everything in my life just seems to be getting worse.  i constantly stare at the razor in my hand and just want to release all this pain and  sorrow and loneliness that i feel but i can't bring the razor down because i can only think what my one year old son would think if he knew what i wanted to do i just need to know another way to release the pain cause i can not figure anything out i know how cutting makes me feel released but i know that i can't do it anymore.  help me
dsf,"I'm tired of being tired and not being able to sleep. I'm tired of needing to TALK to someone and having them throw everything back at me because they are too much of a coward to face their own problems. I'm tired of being alone and I'm tired of not trusting anyone and I'm tired of everything I'm tired of being caused by something else I'm tired of. I'm tired of crying myself to sleep every night. I'm tired of having to take drugs to try to feel better and having them not work. I'm tired of pretending on the outside that I'm some happy go-lucky person who spends 99% of the day choking back tears because I feel like the most insignificant person on earth. I'm tired of dolling out advice to people in my life who are sad and having them all of a sudden just feel better when I have spent my whole life just looking for one true moment of happiness - not one caused by drugs or alcohol or anything else, but just real true happiness. I'm tired of having to pretend like I'm ok, because I'm NOT ok. I'm NOT. This is NOT ok. It is NOT ok that someone has to feel like this. It is NOT ok that someone has to be this sad and lonely and that the most important thing I can do in any given day is just make it through. This is not life. This is supposed to get easier, better, at some point - doesn't it HAVE to get better? Because I am starting to realize it doesn't. I'm starting to realize that some people get to be happy and others have to take the crap that no one else wants. I'm tired of being pushed around and then being called a wuss and I'm tired of standing up for myself and being called a Bitch for it. I'm tired of being the butt of everyone's jokes ""oh, it's all Blugh's fault ha-ha-ha"". I'm tired of all of it. I just want someone to freaking TALK to who ISN""T going to judge me, and who ISN""T going to tell me its going to get better if you just have faith, cause you know what? I've been trying that for 29 years now, and it's NOT WORKING. It is not ok that I felt this much pain when I was a little girl with no real reason to feel this much pain and that it hasn't gotten better. What the hell does a person have to do to deserve that little iota of happiness that everyone else seems to have in abundance??!? I'm tired of ALL of it. Every last little tiny thing. This forum isn't going to help, it just makes me more angry cause I bet everyone who reads it is thinking and feeling the same thing and none of us know what the hell to do to be happy for just one god d*** minute, all we do is sit here and try to help each other make it to the next morning. IT'S NOT FAIR. I don't care if ""life isn't fair""...at some point, I deserve it. I don't care if that sounds selfish, I don't care of it sounds mean spirited or immature or anything. All I want is to wake up tomorrow and not count the minutes through the work day until I can be alone again just so I can sit around feeling lonely because I'm too scared to let anyone in my life because every time I do, they just make it worse with lies, cheating and pain. I just want to ONE day have someone tell me they love me and mean it. JUST ONCE. I just want to actually have the ability to REALLY trust someone. Just ONCE. WHY is it so hard? It's not like I'm asking for the world. I don't even want it forever. I just want it once. I just want one moment of happiness. REAL happiness. Not xanax/zoloft induced happiness, but true, real deserving happiness and I just don't understand what I've done to not deserve that."
dsf,"Hey, My name is Jonathan. I'm 23 years old. I'm a senior in college hoping to be through very VERY soon. I went through a really rough depression era starting around the age of 15 and lasting till I was 21. It started to get a little better when I got into college, but then severely accelerated throughout the years. I took a year off from school to work and basically to get help, which I did. I found out a lot of my depression was cognitive... thinking negatively about myself. When I was growing up, I was a real shy guy. I think some of that though has turned into a social anxiety issue, but I didn't have a great social. I still don't, but once I got help, the psychologist I saw really helped me get past the negative thinking, but I still have really tightly bound emotional issues from time to time that tend to really upset me. It's taken pieces of my personality and completely do a 180. Part of my depression was that I was co-dependent. Now I'm really completely independent. I guess I'm trying more to understand than to get just advice. I can't make sense of my emotions anymore."
dsf,"Glad I can help! Firelizardee has helped me a lot over on the effexor room (that's where most of my posts are). I've never really posted my story, but for what it's worth, here it is: I live in northern New York State where I grew up on the family farm. My brother and I run a feed/hardware/farm supply store. I've got a terrific wife and two daughters ages 1 and 3. My depression hit in January during a bout with the flu; my youngest daughter was hospitalized with febrile seizures and that might be what put me over the edge. My nervous breakdown seemed to come out of the blue, but I'd had an extremely stressful six months between job, illness, and adoption.  I'm also a hard driving firstborn perfectionist, and several family members have had alcoholism or suspected depression. So I guess depression should not have been so big a surprise, but it was. I'm a happy person with a great life! But I feel like I've been right to the edge of the precipice and looked down at Hell. Now I'm doing everything I can to ensure I don't relapse.....but I actually think I'm a better person having been through this. I'm much more appreciative of a 'good day' and I'm much more attuned to the suffering of others. It's amazing how many people I know have similar problems. And I hate that it has to be this way, but suffering does bring me closer to God. I hardly dare say that depression and anxiety was 'worth it'....the memory of the anguish is still too vivid, and besides, it could come back tomorrow. But right now, today, I feel more contented with my crazy, precious, stupid, dear, wasted, amazing life than I have been in years. I'm very lucky to have stumbled onto the right medication the first time, and to have a supportive family that didn't tell me to 'snap out of it'. And I'm very lucky to have the people here in this forum, who know what it's like. I hope, tvk, that in a few weeks you too will be a recovering depression survivor. Till then, we're here when you need us!"
dsf,"I am 30 and fighting with my depression for almost 2 years now. I had psychosomatic problems all the time. Until July, I was on medication with SSRI (selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors) which helped me a lot but never completely and then for some months none. Now I consulted another doctor and decided to try with different medicine called Remeron.
But my question might sound not related .... I somehow think that contraceptive pills (antibaby pills) that I used somehow contributed to my ""state of art"". I used them for 3 months because my gynecologist advised ( she thought that I had some problem with hormones; she did not even check my blood!) and when I stopped with this ""therapy"" I experienced ""total breakdown of the system"".
Now, this pills somehow simulate pregnancy, and there is phenomenon of postpartum depression (the baby blues) and the women over 50 quite often develop depressions (hormones again!) ......!!!

So, I would like to ask if somebody had similar experience with contraceptive pills?!"
dsf,"Hi all, I'm new - just joined yesterday. I'm a 40-year-old wife and mother of five. I've struggled with depression my whole life - came from an abusive household and inherited some mixed-up genes. I was misdiagnosed last year with bi-polar II and spent a year on mood stabilizers and various other junk that made me a zombie. I'm now on Effexor and just beginning to feel sort of like myself again. I'm a freelance writer and I have a weekly column in our local newspaper. I feel like my creativity has gone to pot and I'm waiting for it to come back. Over the last 18 months I've become pretty reclusive - don't answer the phone, don't get out much, just take care of the basic family needs each day - so I've felt very alone. I stumbled upon this site while doing research on Effexor. I've read a lot of the posts and have felt some hope that this might be helpful to me right now. My husband is worn out, as am I. I just want to be better. I want to be a better mother. I don't want to live my life this way. I've felt like half a person for the last 18 months. I want to be whole again. I'm really struggling with self-esteem and guilt - I worry about what all of this is doing to my family. I hope and pray that my children are strong enough to go through this with me. Anyway, that's me, in a nutshell. I'm glad I found this place."
dsf,"I'm new to any kind of discussion like this.  I'm new to any kind of support like this.  I go to Therapy once a week, or rather I did, but it wasn't really making a large difference.  I'm going to be twentytwo soon, and my life is nowhere how I wish it to be.  The funny part is that to get it where I would like it all I'd have to do is go out and get a job, start working.  I just can't seem to leave the house.

I'm not a shut in, or anything.  I love people.  I try and keep friends with everything, but I get self - conscious  all the time.  My early life was pretty difficult when it came to that, getting bullied badly for wearing glasses and being a bit of a dork.  I never really learned those little social rules that everyone else did.  Sometimes I just feel like I'm not on everyone's page, and nothing seems to help.

I became a father at nineteen, and it was difficult.  I loved my girlfriend very much at the time, and dropped out of school to support her and our daughter.  I love my daughter, she's everything.  My girlfriend left me for another man when our daughter was four weeks old, I can't help but feel insecure about this.  Logically I should know she's just not so bright or genuine a person with me, but I can't help but feel part of it was me.

She stopped letting me see my daughter a short time after, I had to go to court and battle things out.  The only accomplishment I've made in the last year that I could feel proud about was to get partial custody and three days a week with her.  I'm attentive and loving father.  I have a great relationship with my little girl.

But I can't feel good about it.  Sometimes it's like, as soon as she's gone, I forget she was even here.  I spend all day in the house, like a zombie.  I'm either on the computer or at the TV, watching baseball.  I know I want to have a healthy and happy life, and I want to have money and security for my daughter, but I can't motivate myself to do anything.

My parents were never attentive, and fight constantly, but I'm twentyone and should be over that.  Instead, it makes me more down now than it ever has.  I'm like a giant pit of negativity all the time.  I was involved with a girl, but that faded quick, and just like everything else it brought me down.

I don't do drugs, or drink, but sometimes I really want to.  Funny part is that I've never felt any kind of relief doing them in the past.  In fact, usually my insecurities and negativity are worse.

I feel like I need to get moving soon, or I'll never get moving.

I tried killing myself after my girlfriend stopped letting me see my daughter, I know how bad that was for me.  I know how I made others feel, and I know how miserable I was.  I don't ever want to get that way again.  But for some reason, and I just don't understand, I can't get myself to get moving."
dsf,"I'm a 24 year old female and I am extremely ugly.

Despite having tried a slew of products recommended by dermatologists, and washing religiously, I nonetheless I have the most disgusting skin ever (EVER.  You know Freddy Kreuger?  He suddenly starts to look quite appealing next to me).  And I have ... unfortunate features.  I have a nose that would shame Pinocchio, small eyes, and a manly jaw.  This never used to bother me too much, because I've lived with being Unfortunate Looking my whole life, heard all the insults in school, and I figured that anyone who didn't want to know me because of my appearance wasn't worth my time.

I try to make the best of what I've got - I'm not especially clever or talented in anything, but at least I dress nicely, get my hair done, wear makeup and all that, and I try to enjoy myself.  I knew I was unattractive, but I hoped that people enjoyed my company, and that one day I might even charm someone with my lovely personality enough that he might want to date me despite my appearance (it hasn't happened yet, but you've got to tell yourself SOMETHING, right?).  I have lots of friends, and even though I'm forever boyfriend -less, I'm the one that people seem to depend on for everything but sex, and that has always been a comfort to me.

But yesterday, I overheard a friend - a friend! - saying that my skin is ""disgusting"" and I ought to ""do something"" about it.  He said that it was no wonder I was single.  He said it was a ""shame I wanted children so much, since no one would ever want to get close enough to impregnate me"".  The person he was talking to suggested IVF. 

I don't think I will ever be happy again.  I want to cut my face off.  I want to cut my face off and stick a grenade in my mouth. I don't want anyone to ever, ever look at me again.   I can't believe how utterly worthless I feel.  It's not just that they think I'm ugly - that's hurtful, but I knew I was hardly God's Gift to Men.  But that they would speak about me like that behind my back ... use THAT word in connection with ME?! ... I can't believe how much I've been kidding myself!!  The message is loud and clear: if you're ugly, you're not worth respect or friendship or love."
dsf,"Messed up right now...not drunk or anything. Bt I feel like my brain has abandoned me these past few days. Can't think straight...Too disoriented. What was I thinking....?! Maybe it worked out before because we never went that far...But now... Fate's dropping me far too many signs that this isn't going to work out the way I expected it to. I remember how I told Freida how I hate set-ups like that because I get attached too quickly. That it's never just... never just that. My stupid heart confuses intimacy for affection too many damned times. No, don't freak out. It's not love that I'm going crazy about. It's our friendship. And you said we weren't compromising anything. I can't believe I agreed when in truth my whole brain was flashing the word ""FRIENDSHIP"" in font number 40, red fill with ten thousand exclamation points. I can't lose you as a friend. It's happened too many times to me and... No, not again. Not you. We've known each other for what? 17 years? Losing you once was enough. Damn it. How stupid of me. And they say sex is the quickest way to ruin a friendship. Damn."
dsf,"ok, im having problems speaking to people about this so i thought I'd try the internet

I'm 20 years old and a student, about 8 years ago i had an experience that changed my life, my dad got himself a new girlfriend, that's where the problems started i won't go into the tedious details (unless you want me too) but basically this led to me developing an eating disorder and a serious case of social phobia (i used to lock myself in my room and only go downstairs for tea: literally) this lasted about 6 years - i suppose 6 years being alone would be enough to disrupt anyone's life .. anyway i have got over the eating disorder but the social disorder remains despite all my best efforts
Let me give you a few examples of how my life is at the moment. i can't even go to the local supermarket because the staff always want to socialize, i have to force myself to go down the launderette cause i don't want to be around other people, the list is endless. can you imagine what its like being a student and not wanting to be in social situations? my social skills have seriously degraded over the years and i desperately want at least one friend, but i don't know where to start. i moved out because i couldn't cope but now i lock myself away 24 hours a day and read my lecture notes over the internet

Basically i have no friends, no money and an addiction to alcohol(i was stupid, thought it would solve my problems) and today I've found out that the bank won't lend me any more money, and i can't get a job - working with others everyday is just inconceivable. i have a counseling appointment on the 3rd of may but i can't wait that long. things couldn't get any worst

i don't know why I'm writing this, but i guess i want someone to talk to that doesn't know me, so i suppose I'm looking for a penpal or just someone to talk to. and to make things worst i think i might be depressed - why else would i be crying while I'm writing this

any views on this would be appreciated, i can't keep going like this."
dsf,"Now this stupid posting thing is screwed up - I can't do anything right

    Got the old depressed suicide bug again.

    It's funny because last night i read some articles I had written  regarding death and suicide, many about saving other depressed persons from killing themselves, recognizing the pain that the survivors go through, and not wanting it to happen to my family. And then the thought rears its ugly head, it would be so easy to let myself go, go into that peaceful night, waiting until my mom dies first (soon - natural causes) and then doing it. Because I am a failure, I can't do anything else but fail at my job. I used to write in a cave type place - a place where my writings would be secure and it's going away. That's how come I looked at my writings.

    I had told my therapist that it seems sometimes I feel angry and selfish and that's one of the triggers that trigger the thoughts of suicide. I have run out of visits covered by insurance I could pay for more but there is no need for visits - I've almost stopped talking. I feel like going home, crawling up on my bed with the teddy bear my husband hates and crying. At the cave web site, the others don't like to hear about suicide so I've stopped writing there (it's another site for depression type people - no one goes there now). I keep talking about death and suicide to my husband and my kid - and I feel guilty but the words and my thoughts are obsessed with death. I can make the decisions about my mom and my kid, but this halfway limbo concerning my states sucks. 

    I guess this is just venting. My mom has at least another week to live ...."
dsf,"just wondering, if there is anyone out there at this time, how do you stop yourself from self - harming when the going gets so tough you start to disassociate? I have been taking my absolute limit of PRN medication, but feel like if I phone a helpline it is all going to be too trivial. My home support nurse has told me I need to stop taking the PRN meds NOW but i've tried and I can't. The urge is so great I can nearly guarantee that by the time I get to bed I will have hurt myself again. PLEASE tell me what helps you in this situation ..."
dsf,"I have just registered and thought I would introduce myself. I posted this in a different place but thought I would put it here too. I hope that is ok. I am Chris, female, age 50. I was diagnosed with depression 8 years ago following the sudden death of my best friend. I was doing ok and learning to live with it when my son, my only child, was killed by a drunk driver on Christmas Eve 2003. My world has collapsed. I was of work for 8 months but eventually returned there part time, and have been coping in my own way until the turn of the year when I had another breakdown. I am still off and isolating. I don't open the curtains; don't answer the door or the phone. Some days I can't see an end to it. To top that, my partner left around the same time because he said he couldn't live with my depression any more. I can't say I blame him. I wouldn't live with me either given the choice. I joined because it seems like a very supportive place, and I noticed you have a forum for grief which I think I could benefit from if allowed access. I sometimes think I'm going mad without my son, and no-one understands the way it is for me. Hopefully I will meet some of you soon. Take care all."
dsf,"Hello. I am a 40 year-old woman, and I'm feeling quite lost right now. I've always been sort of depressed, but have never been given a formal diagnosis. That may change tomorrow. I have an appointment with a shrink. My psychiatrist put me on Prozac 3 years ago. I was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 34, and needed some help getting past that. I am adopted (a biggie for relationship issues), was married at the age of 18, had 3 kids by the time I was 40, and I'm having a hard time transitioning to my new stage in life (sort of empty nest syndrome, I guess) I should be thrilled with my life. I make oodles of money, my kids are all fairly successful & just about on their own, but I'm miserable. My husband and I are in a sort of ""friendship"" relationship, I could care less if he stays or goes. I started having panic attacks after my 40th birthday few weeks ago; I actually thought I was having a heart attack. So now, I'm on 30 mg Prozac & .05 Klonadine (1/2 pill at a time) 3 times a day. I can't quit crying. So... how long does a psychology test take. How long will it take for them to diagnose me with something? These drugs aren't doing a whole lot. Any help would be appreciated."

I've just got to pound this keyboard. There's so much to say but I can't get it out correctly. Pretty pathetic when I can't even say anything but leave me alone. I sure wish there was someone to talk to. Someone to yell at, you know? Just to yell. Around my neighborhood it would be a sign of ""not all there"", you know? I finally see how a few of the people around here drive their cars off the cliff. It's almost spring, about another month to month and a half. If I can just wait that long, I can get out into the yard with the sun and feel better. I have to keep thinking of that, the sun and yard, something to look forward to.

I am feeling really scared of myself at the moment, I have been depressed to some extent for as long as i can remember, and have had many hospital admissions in the past, but for the past few years life has been manageable, I have been in a relationship, not a very good relationship but one that helped me feel safe, i stopped overdosing and cutting, the relationship as i said had its downsides i am not sure love is the word to describe what we had but it was a strong feeling whatever it was, and now that we are no longer together i realize that whatever we had was stronger than anything i had before. i am so lonely and have very scary thoughts, you see my partner has moved back to his home country as he had no choice he was living here illegally, the days we were together before he left i started to have very disturbing thoughts, i even thought of killing him as it would be easier than living without him!!! that is very scary. now that he is gone all the old feelings i used to have about myself and the hatred i have for myself is showing again, he was my protector, my distraction i suppose. but now i don't have that i feel it is only a matter of time until i do some thing really stupid. i have not acted yet as i do not what to have a 'failed' attempt, i am not sure i want help, that is why i am looking here first maybe after this rant i will understand what is happening a bit more, maybe not. all i know at this point is i would rather not be alive, not sure i want to kill myself but i don't want to be alive, don't know if that makes sense"

There was a shot of a group of kids nonchalantly lounging around on the back of a pickup truck upon which was mounted an old-fashioned looking heavy machine-gun, the kind with an armored shield and mounted on a pivot, maybe a mobile anti-aircraft gun. The truck wasn't moving, the gun was in use. So why were a bunch of kids just sitting there? Don't human beings usually seek to protect themselves from danger? Why do people involved in a fire fight walk around as if they were popping out to the shops for a six pack and a box of 200 B & H?

I have started to experience intense rages which appear to be provoked by my girlfriend, who, it seems, thinks that the purpose of a relationship is to psychoanalyze one's partner destructively, to the point of inducing a breakdown. Or something. I have lashed out at her, hitting and screaming and have, during intense screaming matches, to beat my fists against the wall. This is the best I can do to prevent myself from smashing her to pieces. My right hand still hurts me from a couple of days ago. She closes the windows to try to spare the neighbors any unpleasantness. God knows what they must think. Like I could give a fuck. I am inconsiderate, I am selfish, I am a bastard, I have a cold attitude to others, I am a snob, I have contempt for everyone. I don't know which is my stuff and which is hers. I am thinking more of suicide these days. I used to have the regular teenage fascination with my mortality and the potential termination thereof. We were going to try for a baby but she has a hormonal condition which seems quite serious. I have to go wank in a jar and see if my tadpoles are doing whatever it is they should do. She wants me to consider going off with another woman to procreate if it turns out she is infertile. This fills me with rage. I will not tell you why. If you don't understand this you don't understand. What does anyone understand? Is life ever going to change? I am starting to suffer from a new sort of depression. I am starting to feel like I am 31 and the old passion is really not there anymore. Everything is hopeless but it can't ever change. I want to hurt myself and have a fantasy to kill myself with my Leatherman. AHAHAHAHAHA."
dsf,"I'm 25 years old single black mother and I've been struggling with depression ever since I was a small girl. Throughout the course of my life I have had a lot of share of ups and downs: parents divorced in 1985, father was on drugs, domestic abuse, severe teasing, idiotic boyfriends and the list goes on. If there were problems in the home, you dealt with it at home and kept your mouth shut tight. There is no such thing as a black woman being depressed. Black women MUST keep this aura of being strong, independent, swallow your tears, raise your children, take the blows that life throws at you and keep moving with the beat. If you didn't keep moving with the beat, then you will fall through the cracks; everyone sees it and you will be considered as weak and no one will want to deal with you. Everyone around you will let you have it and you will be labeled as an outcast among your fellow black sisters and brothers. I have had a few suicide attempts and my family thought that I was just trying to get sheer childish attention as to say, ""I'm a big baby, pay attention to me."" They took it as a joke and it broke my spirit down to a trillion pieces. I constantly worried what my friends, co-workers, class mates, and lovers would see me as a walking disaster waiting to happen. At the time, I did a good job of ""covering it up"" for a long time. It painfully and slowly came out. I was afraid that if I told some one that I was severely depressed, I would not get the love, support, and care that I needed: family labeled me as ""CRAZY"". So if you have any comments please feel free to let me know what you think about black women and depression."
dsf,"I've posted a few times on these forums and everyone has always been so helpful and supportive, so I'm hoping I can get some help with this.  For the last few weeks, my depression has been so horrendous, worse than it's ever been, that I have not been able to go to work.  I keep calling in sick, and then when I can finally make myself go, I hide in the bathroom crying or go to an empty office (not in my cubicle) and call my mother and cry to her.  I've been in touch with my pdoc, who is in the process of passing me off to another doctor.   Granted, it's at my request, as he is not on my insurance.  However, he's not willing to put me on any other types of medications since he won't be seeing me regularly.  I've spoken to my long - time pdoc from Dallas, my hometown, and he knows me very well.  I trust him more than any other doctor, which is not saying much, but he says that I'm unipolar, aka major depressive disorder, and a mood stabilizer would be the next best thing to try since all the antidepressants are not working.  (was taking 30mg celexa, just upped to 40mg when this all started.)  I'm seeing a new pdoc that's covered by my insurance on Monday, so maybe things will move forward.

Ok, so back to the work thing.  My supervisor is not sympathetic to my problem.  In all fairness, I have not told her details.  I find that most people do not consider mental disease a real medical problem.  She suggested that I talk to Human Resources about taking some type of leave if I don't know when I'll be better.  I'm working on that and hoping one of these doctors will sign for me.

The biggest problem I have is the guilt over missing work.  I never imagined that the depression could get so bad that I couldn't just suit up and show up.  That's been my motto every time things get rough.  I guess I'm looking for validation here.  If I really do have it in my to get to work, I certainly can't find it.  I'm a very responsible person, so this is not like me.  The only time I've ever called in sick is when I was having depression issues, but never more than one day.  Everyone gets a sick day, and I never get the flu or anything, so I don't feel guilty about those days. 

What do I do?  Am I looking at this the wrong way?  It's so hard to be objective when you are so low.  My saving grace is that my parents (who are far away in Dallas) are being the most supportive people in the world.  They believe me when I say I just can't get to work, since that's not like me, but that's not like them either, so I know they want me to get there if I can. 

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this.  I'm hoping someone else has gone through it and can help."
dsf,"I take it that by you saying ""Learn to give rather than take and you will find life turns around!"" that you're implying that I'm a taker and not a giver. And maybe that's so. Maybe all the blood that I've donated (it gives me a sense of purpose and sometimes it seems that the nurses there are the only ones who care that I'm alive, and that's only because of what my body produces) or the times when I do things out of the kindness of my heart rather than for monetary gains or as a means to earn someone's favor or to make them somehow indebted to me like others would do, maybe doing all that still means that I'm a taker. I don't know. I've been told that my perceptions can't really be trusted, but that doesn't sound like someone who's a taker to me. I'm 27. And by that age most guys have been in at least one relationship. I haven't. That's why I've set the timeframe. Everyone I know has had at least a taste of love and human companionship by the time they were 30. So I've decided that if no one wants me, why stay? Living alone means seeing what I want on TV....and having absolutely no one to enjoy or discuss it with. That's my view of it. Pessimistic? Yes, but it's been the truth for me. I'm sorry to sound bitter, but this is exactly what I face out in the world. People see my problems and think that it's my fault. I hoped I'd get a different attitude here."

dsf,"How's it going, all who read. My name is Greg, I'm 19 and have had depression for basically as long as I remember. Here's a brief history of my journey through depression and the treatments I have endeavored. I began on lexapro. It seemed to be helping and then it quit on me (or perhaps vice versa). After that I tried zoloft, and wellbutrin, but to the same effect. Then I turned my world to narcotics (mainly, marijuana and DXM). They helped ALOT, but because they are illegal, I felt a constant public stigma and guilt. I couldn't take it, despite the amazing effects of both drugs. I'm now taking Paxil CR, but I'm going to quit it because it isn't working. I'm beginning to lose hope altogether. It seems apparent to me that SSRIs just aren't for me, or maybe I just haven't found the right one. The real problem with depression is that you have to wait a month on each drug just to see it it's going to work. Those months can feel like years. Anyways, that's who I am. I hope to make a few friends here, and a lot of advice as well. Does anyone one else share these symptoms (if so, and if you think you can help contact me please): Chronic fatigue, lack of motivation/desire, inability to enjoy life, insomnia (including the other obvious and supplementing symptoms) The real killer is I know I have the potential to be someone great, but I have to become happy first...Greg"

dsf,"I can really relate to what a lot of you have said, in being embarrassed about seeking help. Being a teenager I don't have really have the ability to seek help on my own, and there is no way that I'm going to tell my parents. I tried hinting at it - telling them I didn't care about stuff, that I hated being around people. I even tried making it completely obvious in giving up or ignoring things I'm usually interested in, such as getting my driver's license (I'm 16, I'll get it soon). Unfortunately, she's a complete idiot and just passes everything off as being normal, somehow. Hell, once I told her flat out that I thought that 'life sucks,' and she still didn't get it! How stupid can you be?  Much of the time I feel like the biggest idiot on the face of the earth, but not even I am that dense."
dsf,"I'm 19 and I go to school full - time (or try to) and work part - time. I usually end up having a breakdown sometime during the middle of the semester and have to drop either all or most of my classes. In two years I've only completed 27 credits and I feel like a total failure. I struggle through the semester even when the classes are not that difficult. I just have a hard time focusing, concentrating and simply maintaining an interest in my classes. I just feel like an idiot and a failure sometimes because others my age are so much further along than me and I feel if I could just make myself focus more, I would be too. When I am able to concentrate, I do well but it's so rare that I am able to concentrate. On top of all that, I hate my job. It fills me with dread anytime I even think about having to go. I just feel overwhelmed sometimes and I feel like I'm not going to amount to anything in life. I started medications at the end of May but so far they haven't kicked in yet. Is anyone else having this problem with school??"
dsf,"I posted here sometime in December I think. I was having tons of digestive problems, well it's been about 4 months now and I'm still having them, but now I also feel extremely fatigued all the time too, I've had test after test and seen doctor after doctor, everything comes back negative. I was actually put on Zoloft for about a month but taken off of it to try other things b/c that wasn't doing the trick either. I'm back to thinking that it's all in my head, I'm now on b12 shots but those aren't doing anything either. I feel like a zombie, I have zero energy and zero motivation to do anything. Even the simplest task like styling my hair seems like a huge chore that I just want to put off. All I want to do is sleep all day. One thing I've noticed is that man do I ever waste time, I mean I literally do nothing but waste time most of the day. I only have about two hours of class per day and no job so I have tons of free time to waste away. I analyzed what I did in the past hour and it basically went like this: The entire time I was talking to myself non-stop, analyzing things, analyzing my situation, thinking of motivational quotes etc.... I tend to do that all day. For about 15 minutes I stood around leaning against a wall, the next 15 minutes i leaned against the television, then I went and lied down for a while all while still thinking and analyzing things in my head, then I came on the computer to just look at random, pointless things. And that is pretty much how most of my time is spent, I might spend an hour or so just standing around or sitting doing nothing but thinking or daydreaming, that can't possibly be healthy and I obviously have way too much free time, I'm just not sure if this is what is in turn causing all my fatigue and sickness. Have I become so addicted to this lifestyle that my mind will purposely make me feel sick so I have an excuse to live like this?"
dsf,"Just some curious questions here. I am recently undergoing lots of stress in my life. My work is failing and I am struggling keeping up. I recently have a new born in the family as well and extra workload at home too. I noticed these few symptoms:1) Often worrying, going in a loop worrying even about small things 2) Very easily agitated, get angry very easy 3) Weird sleeping pattern, can't sleep at night and sleep 10-12 hours straight during the day 4) Hard to concentrate at anything serious, easily distracted 5) Have up and down moments, sometimes it feels as though nothing has happened, sometimes it hits hard and I could waste one whole day just sitting at home being totally non productive. 6) Easily give up at everything I do, everything seems to be hopeless at times. I am putting off going to the doctors for a long time now. I previously been to the doctors and was given 2 different kind of antidepressants and I really felt awful taking them and stopped. I am reluctant going back because of the same reason. Is this a serious matter that warrants me to see the doctor again? Just hate the feeling but I noticed the ""downs"" have been coming on more and more lately due to more stress load. Please advice, and if possible give some advice concerning the medication I am most likely to be given if I go to the doctors as well...thank you."
dsf,"... being that I don't know anyone here yet, but I feel like I am about to boil out of my skin if I don't get some of this out.

Last week I left the house for the first time in nearly a month and saw my doctor about the state of my head. It was the hardest thing I have ever done (that didn't involve burying a loved one) as I was brought up to believe that one shouldn't talk about one's feelings with other people. Although the sawbones made all the right noises I don't know if he even believes me. I don't know if seeing him was the right thing to do because since walking out of his surgery all I have had is deeper anxiety, more guilt, and a feeling of total and utter desperation - I think it's actually a little worse than before. I feel like this is not going to get any better, ever. I'm scared ... I don't know how this is going to end up for me. I can't see a way out. I have been depressed for a very long time but since losing my job a little while ago I have hit the proverbial bottom. I have suffered from anxiety for many years but recently it has been getting worse - I had my first panic attack last year. It doesn't matter what I try to do to stop it, all I can think about is death, pain, more death, failure, and yet more death. I have been having horrible nightmares for months (and haven't slept properly since my teens).
Long story short  (ish): when I was little the Infamous They told my parents I was 'gifted'. They had high hopes for me. I won a scholarship to a good private school, where the other little girls made fun of me. Then the scholarship ran out and I had to go to a state school. Where the other little children made fun of me, spat at me, physically attacked me and eventually my parents had to take me out of school altogether. They found a better one, where the other kids continued to make my life hell. When I was about 12 or 13  I started self harming (cutting my arms with broken light bulb glass). My mother noticed once, shouted at me, and then never raised the subject again. I continued to do it until I was about 17. My dad bullied me when I was a kid; basically he subjected me to about 15 years of mingled disinterest, public humiliation, and emotional abuse. Then he did a disappearing act three years ago - leaving my mother in financial trouble. I have not heard from him since. I have wasted my life. Nothing I have ever attempted has succeeded - really nothing, and I have never been able to please the people I was trying to please. I used to think I was a talented artist (wanted to be a comic - book artist) but now I have no self - belief left. I haven't picked up a pencil in weeks and I can't even bear to look at any of my work. I can't do anything anymore and there is nobody I can talk to - my mother is my only close family and she doesn't believe in mental illness (if I mentioned it to her she would, at best, get angry and tell me to grow up / stop being so self indulgent). I have two close friends who have their own problems to deal with.
I'm seeing the doctor again on Monday but I fail to see what he can do to fix the fact that I am a useless failure. I am so scared and confused. I have been crying for about a week now and it's getting really tiring. I'm scared that maybe what I think is depression is really just an excuse to attempt to explain my pathetic behavior, that I am really a hypochondriac (my anxiety is now constant and I have convinced myself I am going to die any minute from any terminal illness you'd care to name) and I'm wasting the doc's time & resources. He offered me sleeping pills but I said no as I was afraid to have such things in the house.
Basically, not a good week. Sorry to vent like this but I had to get it out  ...  sorry for being so selfish."
dsf,"I've been reading the ""hoarding"" thread in the OCD forum and I'm jealous. They're having fun bonding by sharing stories about their habits, so I thought we could do some of that with plain old depressives. Sometimes when I'm depressed, I realize that I'm crying over something so stupid that I have to step back and laugh at how upset I've gotten over dumb things. I can't remember all of them, but here are some of the ""highlights"" on the list of Silly Things That Made Starry kitten Cry: -my boyfriend told me his cat was giving me a ""mean look"". I set out a pack of Marshmallow Peeps to get nice and crispy in the open air and my roommate threw them out. (oh, there were tears!). The coffeehouse was out of soymilk on a day I really wanted some soy hot chocolate What's on your list?"
dsf,"Hi there. My name is Tim, I am 38 years old and live in the UK. I have been prescribed 40mg of paroxetine, but stopped taking it a couple of months ago as it wasn't helping me in my situation, which has probably made me physically worse. My depression probably stems from low self esteem and the feeling of general failure. I have suffered for 19 years now, not constantly, as ""success"" at work can suppress it (i.e. times when I feel I am contributing something). To the outside world I probably appear relatively ""normal"" I have to stop now as I need to go out, I'll try and articulate where I am coming from later"
dsf,"I left my bedroom. And I just made myself laugh, which I think is a good thing. Perhaps I should clarify my situation somewhat. I was diagnosed with ADD two years ago (and have probably had it my entire life) and that is what I was taking medication for (Strattera 80mg/d). At the time I wasn't depressed and although I have suffered severe bouts of depression through out my life I am inclined to view them as being linked in some way to my ADD. This depression seems to be surpassing even the worst depressions I have had in the past, however. I have always been inconsistent with long terms goals and also the mundane tasks of life. After high school I received a scholarship to my state college, only to flunk out after the first year because I skipped to many classes. Then I got into drugs for a while. Then I got off drugs for a while. Then I bounced from one crappy job to another. Then I ran off to California. Then I came back home. Then I got a job doing appraisal. Then I quite the job doing appraisal because I was bored with it (how stupid). Then I did more crappy jobs for two years. Around two years ago my friends and family stepped in and had me go to a doctor to see what was wrong with me. Everyone knew that I was smart but could never get my act together. So I was diagnosed with ADD and my girlfriend's mother managed to get me medicated under some type of 'charity policy' (since I haven't had health insurance in many years). My mother also paid for me to go back to school for a year. And I did really good for a whole year. My grades were good, my social life was good - I was succeeding. Then my girlfriend got accepted to a PhD program out of state and I decided to transfer to a school close by to maintain the relationship. We had been going out for almost four years but we only managed to lasted for two months before we broke up. For a number of reasons we lost our connection to each, but I won't bore you with the details. Yet the break up isn't what pushed me over the edge. I found a way to call up some inner bravado and go hit the town with my new friends and roommate. But then money started to get tight and I couldn't go out as much. My TV also stopped working (for no apparent reason) and I stopped paying for the internet so that I could keep my phone on. (I'm using public internet access at the moment). So when the money got really tight all I had to do all day was sit around my bed room and read for hours on end and play with my room mate's cat. Drugs would have been an option at this point if I could have afforded them. Then, sometime during mid November, I got mugged at gun point on my way to my apartment. I had all of my spending (AKA food) money for the week in my wallet so I wound up eating buttered rice for around a week. I also heard a story in the news the other day about someone being shot because they didn't have any money in their wallet when they were mugged so I am afraid to leave the house after 9PM or so (I haven't had a car for some time and didn't need it where I use to live. Where I am now, however, a car seems to be a necessity. My first paycheck at Starbucks came in probably around the first week of December and it felt great because it took some of the financial pressures off of me (i.e., getting evicted). So I worked at Starbucks and paid my bills, but the amount I was getting never allowed me to start saving, only to stay afloat. I took one class at university when I first got to town (before I moved I applied and was accepted), but I couldn't afford the class the second quarter I was here. I can't yet take out student loans either because I have an outstanding student loan from when I was a freshman back in 97. (Sorry if I am rambling by the way, or jumping from one place to the other but this is how my ADD mind works.) Working at Starbucks was kind of cool. I was constantly around people which I like and it certainly kept me active. Of course, at the same time it was kind of depressing to see all of these ""go-getter"" kids studying for 5 or 6 course in the cafe, on a direct path to success while I was a 26 year old working at a Starbucks trying to get back into school. Still, I didn't let this get to me, and I managed to blend in pretty well, mainly because I have always been young looking for my age and can still probably pass for 22 years old. Anyway, I made some friends at Starbucks, but my financial situation, coupled with my slightly more mature (less 'party oriented"") ways always kept me at a distance from my co-workers at Starbucks. That is another thing that I think is a problem of mine. My mind is too serious and lately I have found myself trying to put my intellectual mind in check. It is possible that my seriousness and intellectual postulating is also a means for me to escape from reality. I first really became an intellectual during my last big depression which happened back in 2002/03 after I had to move back home with my mother because I had quite my appraisal job and couldn't pay my rent. When I say moved in with my mother, I mean moved into a town house way out in the sticks. I was living on top of a hill in the middle of nowhere. I had a car, but nowhere to go (and little money for gas). Those were also dark days as I stayed for at least a few months isolated and alone (my mom was usually away at work and I would usually lock myself up in my room anyway). I also had the idea in my head at the time of pulling my jeep into the garage when my mom left for work and just let it keep running until I fell asleep. I think that was the first time I ever contemplated suicide. But anyway, to get back to my original point, I did have internet at the time and I began to use it to explore all of the ideas I found interesting. Soon, I found myself immersed in philosophy and science and for the first time I sensed some type of purpose, something, some trend or *force* that was greater than myself, which I was apart of and which I could dedicate myself to. Now mind you, this wasn't any mystical sort of conversion. I am actually secular in my world view (though I have great respect for those who embrace matters of faith, especially if they understand the moral/ethical purpose it serves). But from that point on I had acquired a direction that I had been lacking in my earlier years. errr, I'm running out of time on this computer, and I've been ranting anyway. I guess really the best way to begin addressing my situation is to stop waking up at 4PM and start going out and look for another job. ""How much more easily said than done,"" Don laments."
dsf,"I just recently got a test back in one of my classes and saw that I totally failed it. Now I'm worried about this class and I can't afford to repeat anything, literally and figuratively. I'm older so I don't have the time to go screw around and repeat classes and I'm sick of school as it is. I hate the uphill battle, just barley hanging on. Why? I did great in high school with a 3.5 GPA. and I made straight A's a couple times in middle school. Other people breeze through school and it makes me angry that it's such a struggle for me just to get C's in college. I'm sick of this I want it all to end, and I still have a whole year after this semester. And even that's not a guarantee the way things are going. Just needed to rant."
dsf,"I don't particularly want to go into details about how I've been feeling the past couple of years, only because it's too much for me to go into, and I don't want to leave out important details or anything. In September 2005, I voluntarily admitted myself to the hospital's psych ward through my psychiatrist, the reason being because my depression had grown so severe that my muscles gave out and I couldn't move anymore, and my will to live had vanished entirely, I stopped eating, I was dehydrated, I stopped going to school, all I did was lay in bed all day, it's the only thing I could do. The decision to go to the hospital turned out to be a very, very big mistake, and I regret making that choice. I felt no connection with the other kids there, especially because I was a week away from turning eighteen, and most of them were thirteen, fourteen, and maybe one or two sixteen year olds. We were similar in an emotional aspect, but otherwise I couldn't relate to any of them. I just bored them, and the way they talked and the things they talked about just confused me. I did get involved with them to an extent during the last couple of days there, but I regret that now. This is a story in itself, but I also got involved with a girl there. She fell in love with me, and so did I fall in love with her, briefly. Only because a girl had never shown any attraction to me before, nor did a girl ever show any interest in me like she did. My feelings for her quickly faded after talking to her a couple of times outside the hospital. She turned out to be a real mess of a person. I did not suffer from the relationship, though. I do not talk to her anymore, and I actually became a better person because of it - I was enlightened. My depression practically disappeared following my discharge from the hospital. I don't know if it was because of the Zoloft that I had begun taking, or because I was finally free from that prison. By the way, I do have a form of claustrophobia. I am not particularly afraid of being in narrow or tight spaces... I am afraid of being locked in narrow or tight spaces. And the hospital was very small, and they did not let you leave or go where you wanted. You were confined to your room, the main recreation room, and the hallway connecting those two places. The day before I was discharged, I was constantly shaking, sweating, and going to the bathroom. I couldn't sleep, and I was afraid to move. I had to stay in my room most of the time and skip out on the group sessions. So anyway, even though I felt better right after getting out of the hospital, that quickly, VERY quickly changed. By mid-late October, I was on home-schooling (and will be until I graduate in June this year, I am a Senior in High School), and attending group therapy several days a week, as well as seeing a psychologist once a week and a psychiatrist every several weeks. All of this therapy did NOT help me. I was feeling extremely depressed and suicidal one night, after a brief fight with my dad (I accidentally bumped the curb while parking, he yelled at me to watch the curb, and I got very upset, pulled the parking break, and walked off while screaming about slitting my throat...), and called one of the therapists at my group therapy to help me. I'd locked myself in a room in my grandmother's basement, and I had called her so she could talk with me and help me to relax. Instead, she threatened to call the police if I didn't open the door and let my dad in. So I opened it, but after that I completely lost my trust in her and couldn't stand being around her anymore. Another counselor at the group therapy also lost my trust. I felt a connection with him, and trusted him a lot, so I told him about my girlfriend (whom I had met online - another story) and he kept on accusing me of things... like using her for sex, or not really being in love, and etcetera. So after having lost trust in two therapists, and then all sorts of insurance problems came up. I stopped going. A few weeks ago, I stopped going to my psychologist as well. I felt like I was being lectured by him instead of actually helped... On top of that, he was taking weekly co-pay from me while he knew my insurance did not require co-pay for anything psychological! (i.e. Counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc.) And he still owes me a couple hundred bucks. He also charged my insurance for appointments I had cancelled. Basically, I took two steps forward, and then three steps back. My depression is not as bad as it was in September 2004, but I am pretty much tired of living. I am constantly thinking of suicide, and have even written brief suicide notes and made plans (which I never carried out). My Zoloft has been at 150mg for the past couple of months. It's helped my social anxiety slightly, but my depression - no. I am aware of the state that I am in, and I am simply tired of it. My future is all dark, I don't see things getting better. When I spoke with my girlfriend this weekend, I cried the entire night...  I just couldn't take everything anymore. I saw a new psychologist last week, but again, I feel like I'm being lectured. I am eighteen years old, and being talked to as if I were twelve. It's insulting and makes me feel even more left out of things than I already do. I don't know."
dsf,"Hi there, I have never posted anything before so I don't know if this will work. Does anyone have that feeling in the back of your throat like you are going to cry? I have it off/on throughout the day sometimes it is so bad I have to really concentrate not to let the tears come. I'm on Effexor xr now and adrrall 2x/day. Sometimes the medicine makes a difference but most of the time not. I have been on a bunch of other medicines but they usually only work for 6months then the feelings of sadness come back again. Anyone else had this throat feeling?"
dsf,"Hi I'm a 20 year old gal from west coats of Scotland and i feel i need somewhere to spill my thoughts. I'm a student nurse with 2 part time jobs and college so obviously in stressed and id doesn't help that I'm in a big bit of debt. I'm listening to songs which usually maked me happy and i cry, I tend to drink quite a bit because I'm so unhappy, i don't know what to do , I feel as though everyone is passing me by in my life I'm overweight which doesn't help the situation although i am trying to lose it. it doesn't work. I've been in trouble with the police as i went off the rails i started taking drugs which made me happy and then got warnings from the police. I seem to be writing this and not making any sense to my self. Does anyone else feel like this as i feel as i feel like I'm the only one that feels like this. I sit and wonder what it be like if i didn't exist would anyone miss me would anyone notice if i didn't turn up for college or work. My life feels so useless there are people dying from disease and instead of me they could have a longer life if they took my place, i don't know what else to do i cant talk openly about how i feel so i have to resort to a web based environment , don't think i don't have plenty of friends because i do i just feel as they have enough to worry about instead if thinking about me. If anyone else out there wants to chat feel free. Wouldn't blame you if you didn't. The best times of my life at the moment are when I'm sleeping."
dsf,"I have just joined up because recently things have become a little too hard to cope with alone. I have suffered with depression for as long as i can remember really. but it's hard to find people who I can talk to. I always end up feeling like a burden, i know my friends just want me to be my happy party girl self, not the unhappy honest self. so I tend to keep quiet. Would love to have people to talk to about how i feel. I also have two little boys who I have to keep a happy face on for. find it hard to keep it up."
dsf,"Hello everyone. My name is Amy. I discovered this page just by searching on the internet for depression forums. One good thing about me, I believe, is that I'm very mature for my age. I am seventeen, and really hope everyone here is open-minded to age being just a number. So please, do not reply telling me I will have it better later on, or my problems are because of my age. I know there is a possibility that things will get better, and believe me, I really do not think this has to do with teenage hormones. I have read about many middle aged women and men with the same problems. I understand that I am a very negative person, most likely due to depression. I am very irritable, only maybe once a week I am happy for most of the day. I also know that I have never really been happy. I have never been optimistic, and have always been sensitive, emotional, and not very confident. At the moment I do not have any friends. I haven't really had any friends for a few years now. Once every few months or so I'll go out, and then just want to leave within a couple of hours. It's very stressful to me. And when I do want to leave, I just tell myself I have a problem, because everyone else I know seems to get along with people just fine. I am also like this with jobs. I go in and out of jobs. One time I even faked a family emergency just to leave work...and I was crying about it. If one thing goes wrong for me, if I smile at someone and they don't smile back, if I feel insecure in any way, my first reaction is to flee. I also, for the most part of my life have always been in a relationship. My boyfriend as of right now and I have been together for over a year. Both of us cheated on each other in the beginning of our relationship, which might be the cause of our jealousy problems now(mostly mine). But, before this relationship, I also had the same problem. I never felt good enough, I believe I will never feel pretty enough. I have big issues with porn, and basically every little thing you can think of. Recently I've been reading about depression and anxiety. I feel the more I understand how and that it is a part of me, the worse I feel about myself. And the more insecure I feel. I feel like I am not fun to be around since I am irritable and sad most of the time. I feel like my boyfriend will find someone who has more of the good qualities. I feel that I will never satisfy or make my parents proud, since I keep leaving jobs. They tell me I'm just lazy. I have quit every single thing in my life that I've tried since I was young. But I really think it's because of my mental state. Going out in public is terrifying, because I don't want to feel bad, ugly, unfun, or not funny. I fear social situations, because I am horrible at making conversation. I've been considering therapy and depression/anxiety pills, but my mom tells me people who take them basically just don't feel anything at all. And I am also afraid to see a doctor and share my feelings. I feel like I have no one to talk to. My dad and I have never had a good relationship, we maybe say two words to each other a day. We have had kind of a bad past, and maybe that's the reason for our lack of communication. My boyfriend doesn't really know how to talk about important or emotional things, unless they have to do with him. I feel like every time I cry I push him farther away from me, and feel I have to hide everything because me being depressed is a turn off to him.  I don't know. I guess we all have to vent somewhere, and to know that there is a place where people feel the same is a great thing to me.  I wish there was an easy way to feel good about myself, and just be happy for once. But I suppose these things take time and a lot of effort. I'm sure I left some things out, but this is all I want to throw at you all for now. Thank you for listening."
dsf,"Strawburygrlland has been invaded, discovered by someone too close-to-home, so I will be bidding y'all adieu. Damn, I thought I knew how to spell that... It has been fun. The site will remain, but will cease to be updated. If anyone cares to keep in touch, you can drop me a line the usual way. I may even start up a new, truly super-secret blog eventually. As for life right now, things are looking very positive. K & I are talking and in love again (still?). In fact, this past weekend Husband and I went up to their place and the 4 of us got busy and had a grand time in the bedroom. It was as amazing as the first time, possibly even better. We're looking forward to more adventures shared between the 4 of us, you can be sure. To everyone who has supported The Strawbury One, I owe you much. Thanks for not judging, and sending me so many cheers and well-wishes. You've been fabulous."
dsf,"I read ""The Art of Happiness"" a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it. The Dalai Lama is something else. I've forgotten a lot of it but I do remember him saying that we should strive to be unswayed by emotion so that we don't differentiate between good things happening or bad things. I am the opposite of this. When good things happen I feel good. When bad things happen I feel bad. I loved what you said about there being no such thing as self loathing in Tibet. I wonder if this means there is no depression. I've always wanted to be a monk. Maybe that's the answer. Thanks for the interesting post Harlequin. I will now go and Google breathing meditation. By the way, can anyone tell me how to post partial quotes? Do I have to erase the bits I don't want posted after hitting +quote or is there another way?"
dsf,"I'm 16 and I've thought about suicide some, never tried yet. I'll tell you about myself. I'm in high school ...   just got my license. I've been to two shrinks, neither for depression but a anger problem, though I don't have one, just Mom and me fight and we've always been close. No one has ever known that I've thought of suicide except when I was in junior high and it wasn't really much true, sure a little but I was more agreeing with my cousin when she said that she has thought of such. Now I've been recently noticing (for a small bit months now) how I have been having some I guess you would say symptoms (pardon my spelling) of depression and all. Especially I've been losing interest in things and feeling guilty over everything and that's the most extreme ones, I have some others too. I've taken online tests and it says that I may have depression. But I can't believe I do. I mean why would I have depression. I would just guess I'm making it up to myself or something. We'll I've always been interesting in  psychology stuff like personality disorders, so maybe I'm just reading into it wrong or something. That would probably be what a shrink would say so I don't want to go to one, plus I don't really like talking to them. Another thing is one of my friends just attempted suicide, lucky survived and if I say something to someone they would think I'm just saying such because of that. I've felt like this before that though .... another thing is I'm a Christian and Christians shouldn't feel this way, right? Can someone help me figure out if I'm just making this up in my head!!!"
dsf,"Do good guys actually exist, because i'm beginning to lose faith. Every guy i have taken an interest in has been bad for me. I'm only 18, but i have slept with 7 people, which i think is a lot and makes me a slag. I started dating at the age of 10, and was with that guy until 15.  I've done the whole dating thing now, i just want someone to take care of me and try to understand me. I've only ever been a sex toy to men ... and i hate it. Not one guy has actually wanted me ... they just wanted sex.

Everyone keeps telling me that i need to have fun, go out, get laid. But that isn't my style ... i want someone to hold me tight and tell me everything will be okay ... but i fear good guys don't actually exist for people like me."
dsf,"Help!
I just want to cut, and cut, and cut.  It feels so good.  So far I have managed to maintain some sort of self control and only cut my wrist and genitalia.  I'm afraid because I have the whole weekend to myself except for a few things I'm doing with friends.  My mind is full of strange thoughts.  I'm sorry I was so descriptive.  I really would like it if someone would respond.  I'm not seeing my therapist until Wednesday and I got into a big fight with my husband on Friday about my depression.  He said I make him depressed.  He doesn't know how to handle me.  He thinks that depression is a choice not a disease.  He wants me to talk to him about my problems like I talk to my therapist. I can't.  He says things like I throw him a guilt trip.  He is one of my problems.  He damages my self -esteem."
dsf,"I can't sleep again. My brain won't shut up. I have class at 9:00 am. I don't know if I am going to make it. When I lay in bed, all I can think about it how horrible I am. I mean, I am ugly, fat, a waste, stupid, worthless. When I talk to my boyfriend about it, he just says that I am great and beautiful. Then I just get mad at him, because I don't want to hear all that. It is not true. I have been trying to lose weight. I gained about 10 lbs over the summer, due to depression. Now all my clothes are really tight. I have been exercising and eating right for about a month, and still nothing has changed. The pants are all still uncomfortably tight, and no weight loss. I try really really hard to stay positive. But late at night, when I am alone and anyone close to me is hundreds of miles away, it is too hard. I end up hating myself. Telling myself horrible things. I hate myself. I want to be someone else. I want to be a better person."
dsf,"I'm so mad at myself.  Angry more like it.  I truly hate myself right now.  My wife and I are currently separated, and it's all my fault.  I know, I know, 'don't blame yourself'.  Well, the truth is that it is all my fault this time.  I did some pretty terrible things to my wife and family to make them leave. 

I also opened my mouth when I should have just kept it shut.  I said some pretty stupid things over the past year plus.  I had become some sort of monster, and didn't know what to do.  When it got found out about, I told my wife that I wanted her to take the kids and get away from me.  Why did I do that?  I love my wife very much, and don't want to lose her.  I just don't know how to express that to her.

I'm so angry that I just want to hurt myself.  I don't care how or what happens.  I want things to go back to the way they were before I started having my problems.  I just want to shout and hit something or someone. 

I wish someone could help me.  I am seeing a therapist, but I don't know if it is helping.  My mind is still a jumbled up mess.  My life is even worse, and I don't know what to do to make it better. 

I feel so down and out of it.  I can't sleep, I don't want to stay awake.  I don't feel like eating at all.  I just don't think I care much any more.  What good will it do to get my life straightened out if I don't have anyone to share my new life with. 

I've been so unhappy and depressed for so long, I'm not sure I even remember how to be happy.  Why do I feel this way all the time?  I'm so unhappy all the time that my wife thinks that it is her that I am unhappy with.  Honestly, I don't know any more.  What's wrong with me?

I see all these happy couples walking around, and here all these happy Christmas carols being played on the radio, and I get very jealous.  Why can't I be happy like that?  Why couldn't I be happy with what I had?  I had everything that I ever wanted, a loving, beautiful wife, two great kids, and one more on the way.  I should have been the happiest man in the world.  Instead, I screwed it all up and lost everything that I held dear to me.  What kind of idiot does something like that?

I just needed to rant a little.  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.  I just don't know what to do now."
dsf,"I'm a 23 year old female who has suffered from depression for the last 3 years. I remember having bouts of it in high school, hating myself and thinking i was ugly and worthless, but it generally passed and things got better. Then all of a sudden when i was 20, i just started crying constantly, feeling out of control, wanting to dig a hole and bury myself, not knowing what to do with myself, feeling hysterical. I went on medication after a few months, and things improved, but it's something i still deal with every day.

I am at university full time, as well as working part time, and just feel like i'm constantly on the edge of going insane. I just moved to a new city, and feel so lonely, wanting attention but i feel like no one's interested. Worst of all, i miss so much university (because i can't get out of bed in the morning) that my tutors regard me as a bad student, which makes me feel so bad, because i know i'm smarter than most of the people in our class. I just want everyone to know i'm not lazy and boring, i just feel like my body is made of lead and i have no energy and no drive to get up in the morning. I have just started seeing a psychologist and she is really great, but it's so expensive i have to work extra shifts at work just to manage, which makes me even more stressed out!

I don't want to take time off university because i took last year off and it made me feel worse. I really love my course and it's pretty much the only thing that gives me joy ...  if only i could get out of bed to go!

i'm so angry at myself, my life wasn't meant to be like this..."
ndf,"I really don't want a blog, but Kendra is MAKING me one so I guess I should write SOMETHING for it. I hate blogs. I think they're dumb and pointless and no one ever wants to read them. I mean, seriously, most people don't want to sit there and read about what someone else did all day long. So why would you be interested in what I've been doing? So my blog is going to be unusual, hopefully somewhat interesting. Talk to y'all later!!  Peace out, A-town!   -Chel"

ndf,"Well I do not have any high hopes about this blog since it is my first one!  I shall just ramble a little bit and then go looking at the other capabilities of this site.  Currently I am sitting in work winding away my time until dinner.  It is a beautiful day today and I have my office window open, my office is situated below the canteen, the food smells are wafting down and making my tummy rumble.  My lunch today is of the packed lunch variety, cheese sandwich, plain crisps and a flapjack.  Not very healthy I know.  It was made in haste this morning as  my car was parked in  a space that was not paid for outside my flat!  Well after that initial interesting reverie regarding the delights of my lunch, I will sign off!  Greetings to all.  Bo xx"
ndf,"Ok, so I went to bed at 4.48 a.m. Yes, very late. But it's not my fault! The medicine makes me sleep earlier and then I wake up and voila, its that time. So I didn't go to school all week. Oh well, and I should be studying for exams, but if I sit in a chair, I just feel like fainting. Oh, and my mother is a bitch. My computer isn't working and she refuses to call Dell up to fix the problem! Ugh!  Meanwhile, when I EVENTUALLY fall asleep, all I can dream about is my damn Biology exam. Maybe it's telling me that I should actually study. WHO KNOWS!?"

ndf,"well well well, i starting a new blog b/c im bored and my friend thought that this would be a good idea. But today was not a good day for me though. I was going to go watch a movie, Spiderman 2 today with friends, so got up around 8:30am today and started my cleaing early so i wouldn't have to worry about it later in the day and can get ready for the movies too. So i walked toward my room and this dumb crate was in my way and i stubbed my baby toe on the crate and part of my toe nail came off and i broke it, eerrr! It seems as though bad things only happen to me, oh well. But all day i was in freak'n pain and didn't think much about it untill the sharp pain started getting worse and worse through out the day. So now im on pain killers that are making me feel so weird and in a twilight zone it seems like, that i've been trying to sleep through out the whole day to get my mind off the pain. I even tried to watch BarberShop 2 which didn't work b/c my mind was defiantly on my pain. I thought that i can really take pain but i thought wrong lol. But i guess i'll get my booty to bed and sleep!!"
ndf,"Oh, how I love being sick...especially when it means missing work. This week, for instance...I come down with something earlier in the week, end up missing two days at work, and things just fall apart while I'm gone. This results in me having to play ""catch-up"" for at least the next week.  This isn't the first time this has happened, either. Not two months ago the same thing happened, and on top of everything else, I still had to go in to fix a problem that no-one else at work could.  On one hand, it's nice to be needed. On the other hand, I could REALLY use an assistant!  Oh, what do I do? I'm the lone LAN administrator/IS technician at my workplace.  Knightsabre"
ndf,"So, this is the first time I have ever posted something. Been thinking about a lot lately, so this might seem to be pretty random.  Things are changing all around, but I don't really think any of it is really going to make much of a difference. Out with the old, in with the new. New managers to work with at work. New owners to work with at work. Everything is new at work, except for me and what I do. Show up, talk to agents, managers, publicists, local bands, local press, etc. Book shows, promote shows, settle shows. It's almost getting to a point where I feel like I am going through the motions. I don't get as excited as I used to about bands. I'm probably just a lit bit jaded, but I hate booking shows like W.A.S.P., and ICP and all that other crap. At least by booking these shows, I get the resources to book the bands that I like. Just take the good with the bad.  About to be an uncle for the first time. Pretty excited about that, but I'm kind of scared for my sister. I just hope that she and her boyfriend are able to raise the baby together. I think it would crush her if he ends up leaving. I know that it will all work out in the end, but I have a feeling that it might be kind of a rocky road.  Been thinking about life and love a little bit too much lately. I really miss what it's like to be in a relationship with someone. It's been two years now, and I still find myself thinking about the good times I had with Colleen from time to time. It's not that I miss her, I think I just miss the idea of having someone like her to have around. It's nice to be able to see someone everyday and not get sick of them. Someone with whom I can share my thoughts and feelings.  On a similar note, I think it's time that I start taking care of myself a little bit more. I know that with my personality, I will always want to go out and have a good time. In turn, I think it's time I get off my ass and start trying to be healthier. Thinking about giving up meat again. We shall see. I know that if I manage to lose about 30 lbs, my confidence about my appearance will be a lot higher. Probably would help with the idea of trying to date again."
ndf,"Fourth of July: It was kinda boring for me. A few of Rachel's friends came over and we shot off some big fireworks that my daddy bought. It was alright I guess. Wow, okay now onto these last 2 days. I had to wake up at 5:30 in the morning on Monday to get ready to go to my Grandparents' house(which is in Branson--4 hours away). On the way we got McDonald's breakfast(because that's the only meal they can make that is good enough to choke down.) We got to their house at around noon. We came in and talked for a little bit, then we watched the tape of my promotion and from dance camp. Then we sat. And talked. And sat. And ate. And sat. Then my dad and grandpa went outside to unload firewood and they forced me to help them. Okay, I'm not the type of girl that goes out in the woods and loads firewood into a 30 year old Ford truck, but I did it just because I'd rather do that than sit inside and talk to my grandma, lol. When we were unloading it onto the stack of firewood that was already there, I got bit by an ant. It hurt like hell, so I went inside to put aloe vera on it. I checked my phone and saw that Kierston had called me, so I called her back. We ended up talking for the next half hour until my family came back inside and then we ate spaghetti for lunch. After lunch, Rachel and me went outside and rode the four-wheeler for a little while. Then I came back inside and called Cam and we talked until he had to go to baseball. We ate mac and cheese for dinner and then we watched TV for a little bit. Then I called Kier again cause I was bored and we talked for a little while. Then I came inside again and got ready for bed. I figured I should go to bed early since old people wake up early. The next day, my dad came in and woke me up at 9. I was soo mad. So I got up and ate breakfast, then went back to sleep till about noon or 1. My phone was dead, so I couldn't call anyone, unfortunately. We talked again for like an hour or whatever and then we left. On the way home we stopped by IHOP and I got some chocolate chip pancakes. And we got home late last night and I got on AOL, watched TV, the usual. Went to bed at like 3, woke up today at 12. Today Colton came over to see Rachel. They went swimming and she's taking him home right now. I'm sitting here bored out of my mind typing the longest thing I think I've ever typed in my life. Later..."

I had this grand idea of me making like 2000 flashcards and learning all the words but I'm so tired right now.  I have to read my other book this weekend as well...which I haven't even started on.

Can you explain why you feel the way you do about things?"
ndf,"I’d like to share a quote I particularly like:   	“We find comfort among those who agree with us - growth among those who don’t.” 									- Frank A. Clark  How are we ever suppose to grow and learn if we are constantly surrounded by people who agree with us?  When you sit and discuss a topic with someone else who has an opposing view you will learn more from that one person than if you sat and discussed that same topic with 10 other people who believe what you do.  Although, I have found some very interesting conversations start up between people with the same views who are just pondering other possibilities.  I have a friend who is interested in the building sciences like I am, the two of us can get together and just bounce back ideas about what if this were to happen or if this one thing changed wouldn’t that make a huge difference to the houses and buildings going up right now?  It’s really cool to have someone on the same wavelength as you.  But, as far as growth goes, I feel I learn more by talking to someone about a topic that we are opposed on rather than have the same feelings.  When I come across a good conversation like this I’ll try to remember to share it."
ndf,"august  3  my thoughts are filled with just getting out, leaving everything behind. maybe i am a walking contradiction. there is no other way for me but to lead. here i am now. leading. the pressure is getting too much. sometimes i feel like this is not me anymore. i hate some stuff i am obliged to do. smile here, smile there. give commendations. be a people person. i fucking hate all these crap.  there are times i want to be left alone. i want to have some quiet time. i want to do my thing. in spite of myself, i realized all i want to have is a low profile life. a quiet life. maybe that's why i wasn't too keen on modelling. people are so nosy. and i couldn't just smile when asked to. i just want to do my thing. i want to sleep when i want to, i want to wake up no matter how late. i want to dress up the way i want to, i hate ties, i hate looking so yuppy. i want to curse whenever i feel like it. i will be friendly when i want to, i will be nice when i feel like being nice.  show me the light please as i am about to go nuts where i am now."

ndf,"""...or from him touching me..heh.. :D"" A quote from the girl that I am supposedly talking to and about to go out with's away message. To be honest it has been about 2 weeks since we've seen eachother but a few days before she told me that she wanted to be with me but then she writes shit like this? Is it wrong for me to have an awkward type feeling? I dont think so. Why are you women so god damn complicated? Can't you just tell us the truth instead of making guys like me assume what you're thinking.   Doesnt seem like anyone reads this but I guess it's good for me to relieve tension."
ndf,"Hey ... I'm baaaaack ...  Lots of you guys have e-mailed me, asking me to start up the UrbanBoys newsletter again.  I know how much many of you enjoyed it.  Well, how about a compromise?  I'll start this blog, and you can all help me out.  Let me know what you want to see ... it's all yours!  Right now, I'm just getting things set up ... in the next few hours or days, I hope to get the format ready and get started!"
ndf,Today I found out that Bj the guy i've been obsessing over for like forever likes me back. YES! But also the other guy I like...I think LoVe brought over his girlfriend. We're really super good friends and now he has a girlfriend! WHY TRAVIS WHY!? But maybe I can just make my move on Bj and see what happens with that. I hope some thing good! He is soooooooooo hot. God Life is good. By the way. He slept at my house yesterday. Altho he was drunk! Today after he left...;-)...he stopped by like 6 times. Plus mi (i hope future) boi just bought a new car. Guess whos gonna need a ride...hint hint. Well tomorrow I make my move. WoW this is great...........I just wanna grab him and kiss him!!
ndf,"I love that word. Ponderings. If you break it up you get pond, like lake, eh, like oh, ring like disaster. Because wedding rings do tend to end up in disaster. So pondering is like dipping into a lake of disaster. Mmmm. Maybe if I shut my eyes I'll be able to feel the waves washing over me, hear the delicate ripples as leaves fall into my pond and breathe in the air of immortality. If the Philosophers Stone is a soluble tablet, my lake of disaster is the solution for it. Like in chemistry. I dreamt the other night that I was in a cold, dark lake and that I was below, watching the world through a rippled mirror. I saw myself peering down and a white hand slooshing the water and slooshing my view. When it was finally clear again, all there was was a star that lit up the lake. And in the middle of the star, there was me, spread out in a crucifix shape with my eyes blazing and my hair fanning out like it does underwater. I reached out to feel the wetness on my hair, but I felt only heat as the star plunged into the icy water and I melted into oblivion. I love random dreams."
ndf,"The city I work in, which feels and seems much more like a town, has a courthouse square downtown.  There is a big courthouse surrounded by a fair bit of grassy area with lots of trees, a beautiful little spot really.  It really adds to the whole town feeling.  All sorts of things happen in the town square: art festivals, performing art festivals, food & drink tasting, local merchant festival, and many more.    Well, one thing I've noticed since I started working downtown is that people (men mainly) like to take a mid-day nap in this courthouse square.  I lived outside of new Orleans before I moved here, so at first I thought these nappers were homeless people, untill I paid a little more attention to them.  The majority of these napping people are wearing clean, well kept clothes, and are clean-shaven.  In other words, they are just people who live/work around downtown who like a little afternoon nap.  They pick a tree, lay down, and just doze off for a little while.  I find that kind of interesting."
ndf,"QRF (Quick Reaction Force) for those who are not in the military the job of QRF is to be the first responser to any threats happens on camp.  QRF night, like most of my QRF duty I spend hours looking at the night sky. QRF is lame and that shows you how much action this camp gets. Well Iraqi night sky is nice its almost as nice as the Hawai'i night sky. Of couse hawai'i is at a much higher location. The city just don't know what they are missing. I just wish I have a camra that could take picture of the stars so I could show it to people back home. As I lay on top of my hmmvv staring upward at the sky I easy counted hundreds of stars. However I wasn't bore enough to name them. Even thought I feel that they needed names. About an hour into endless staring I notice stuff are flying across the sky. They look like tracer rounds. I was like wow we are under attack. But hmm.... they look like they are 300 miles up in the air. Than I was like well they are shooting no were need us so I just watch the growing stuff flying 300 mile over me for 3 more hours. By the way I did see few huge growing flying stuff fly across the sky. That could of be a missile or a meteor burst. If its a meteor I am going to name it ""shooting cock shit""."

ndf,"the month --june the day 29th... the hour...(not yet) ladies and gentlemen i invite you all to the biggest success story of all times....Errrr or maybe not as big,but big enough to let my 6ft 3inch body frame seem pulverised, into as small a case as a case study.My wheatish comlexion seems to have improved not because of any bodily improvement but because of the dying signs of radiance...as they say radiance is brightest from a candle only when its almost exhausted. no never, i did not (right now iam knoding my head from left to right at the speed of light) expect a business school to be sooooooooo gruelling. PHEW! PHEW! PHEW!...oh sorry but those are the only sounds which i can expropriate out of my self...I CHOKE! CHOKE!.....to be contd...."
ndf,"this is the first time i ever done one of these, it seems a little awkard for me considering i'm such a shy person  But i feel its something that i need, no one listens anymore.  Its like there deaf to everything i say, i'm going unheard....its a really painful feeling.  i heard a song today by story of the year, ""anthem to out dying day"", it was a song that appealed to me in no sort of reason, but i still felt compelled to do something.  i have listened to it non-stop for about 2 hours and it still hasn't gotten old for me.  Its a new one for me considering i like songs for about a week then never listen it for awhile.  i don't know what but it appeals to something in my life, something i've been wanting for awhile.....her. she is one of the most perfect people i have ever seen i my life. She lights up my entire life when ever i am near her.  its like nothing i've ever felt, and it aches...because i can't tell her how it feels...how will she react?  she is the type of person that isn't very open...like me.....i can't just tell her ""hey i love you baby!""  that just won't cut it, for me and for her.  It seems like she wants something more in a relationship, something i'm trying to find and seem to have found, but can't tell her.  Will she reject or rejoice?  I know it seems like a cliche type of love story but that is just the way this story is.  I wish she would just run into to my arms and say, i love you and nothing is never going to change that.  My heart grows heavy when i see her with other people...other men...i always feel like my window is closing to her..like i'll miss my shot..and i will....i just can't do anything about it.  I won't too, but i just can't.  I don't want to ruin what we already have.  I keep thinking that she will freak out and our relationship will never be the same with her.  Its a solitary confinement for me.  No windows, only a door, which i'm afraid to open, afraid to see whats on the other said.  Something lies beyond the door that i want too see, but i am afraid too...what happens if disater lurks beyond the door..."
ndf,i really do not want to lose u... i mean probaly u have some pressure from ur frens.. i mean ever since that day u broke up with me.. i cry almost every night when i see ur neo print on the duck that i hang on my phone.. i mean i like really treasure u compare to my other steads... i really want u back lorx... now without u.. i feel that my life is really empty.. cause last time we used to like call eacch other every hour or so.. we 2 months 10 days.. yet when we talk on the phone we still got lots of things to say.. lolx.. i mean we used to quarrel alot over the phone and some time while we were outside.. but we always solve it... than we became more loving.. than on that day on the 17 of july u told me during the NDP preview that u dun like me any more... i feel really sad.. this is however the only problem that i have not find the solution to solve..

ndf,"So these two girls published an article in the school newspaper about the cliques in my school. It's a horrible article. Like, get shot in the head and die. In it they listed what cliques exist at my school--The Asians (it's funny they list that as the first one, because thats the 'clique' they belong to) the Brown kids, The Ghetto Group, The Cheerleaders/Jocks/Preps, the Punks, the Goths and the Druggies. Okay, what the hell? There are 3 kids at my school that could be labeled punk. Two of them are actually Punks, and one of them is a good friend of mine. The other one is a girl who used to be punk, but now she's all...not. This entire article is about how we shouldn't be labeling kids because HEY!  That's what causes cliques!  And then they go and categorize every student at the school? Assholes.  And then, they thought it would be nice to teach me about these cliques.  Students feel acceptance and approval when they are with their ""own people"". How does one come to be labeled as a part of one of these cliques? The way one speaks, dresses common interests and tracking levels.   Tracking levels? Okay! I have no idea what that means.    Students who can be categorized in more than one clique are considered ""confused"". For Example, we were listening to two studens in our class talk about a boy who likes to dress more urban but he listens to rock music at the same time. People were making fun of the boy behind his back saying he was ""confused"".  Cry me a fucking river.  The article goes on about stupid shit. Saying that the two most segregated clubs in my school are DECA and the Multicultural Club. Ironically, THEY'RE IN BOTH.  Oh, I don't want to join that club...It's so...Asian  What the hell. People use that as an excuse?  They ended it by saying that the only way to change this is to make a difference...within. Fucking Hippies.  On that note, all i have to say is...    We can dance if we want to, we can leave your friends behind  'Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance  Well they're no friends of mine     Amen."

ndf,"Bored am i on this summer's last sunday as  i attempt to make the best of whats left. So last thursday i got back from the JH Pendleton YLC  ...damn it was boring. despuite the boredom i did learn a thing or two about the American way. As you may know  ive been working on a few songs lately ( each of which is dedicated to a friend) and  ive kind of quit  on the funeral one and am at a roadblock  for Haleigh's. Ive completely changed everything about the one dedicated to Herumi. the lyrics are that of a lovesick ballad and instead of guitar and back up instruments, it is solely piano, but rather simplistic. strangely  i consider it my best love song  ive written and the irony is that the girl to whom i am writing it(Herumi) is not even my GF. i think i shall alter haleigh's as well. i guess the problem is that everything about it is too complicated...that damn solo.   despite my end of summer blues i do feel strangely enthusiastic about the upcoming schoolyear. maybe ill meet a nice, pretty, sweet, academically inclined girl whose innocence accentuates her natural beauty...but also strong..like it would take more than one bullet to stop her. it would also be cool if she knew how to play an instrument or knew carpentry or steel welding. damn..maybe  i should find a girl who works at home depot. Eh screw it, my two loves as of now are school and Rock n Roll..GO ABSTINENCE!  k so ive been saving up for a sniper air rifle. i shall get it soon. i cant wait to kill that damn crow terrorizing my dog. i swear i will shoot that things head clean off it neck.  well now i am off to the 32nd street Naval Exchange to get some new clothes."

ndf,"Maybe I'm too nice, but it would be hilarious to bust someone out when they are yapping on and on about nothing but lies.  It's the same bullshit over and over again.  Save your saliva.  No one wants to hear it anymore.  It's old.  It's lame.  And most importantly, nobody's impressed.  Obviously they've never heard of that ghetto phrase, ""you ain't gotta lie to kick it.""  And yes, I'm somewhat of a bitch.  Tell me something I don't know already."

I dunno, I don't hate anything, except that bloody boat! god, I hope my parents sell it so I never have to look at it again. anyways, I got to see Carmen today, so my bad mood was all but over and done with, so I'm good, it's about 12:30 at night right now, and that's probably the reason why... I started... this blog, good night everybody."
ndf,"Yesterday I spent my day playing on the Internet and bummed that Erin has not called me back. I really big crush on her. I really miss being with someone and I am definitely looking for love - which is very unlike me.  Greg and I went out last night. I haven't seen him all summer. He was amazingly beautiful as always. It was the first time my friends were introduced to him. My girlfriends went on and on about how hot he was. Eric, my ex, was actually the first to tell me, ""he is a handsome guy,"" which I thought was really funny. We got extremely drunk and danced all night long. He came home with me, but I puked before anything could happen.  I like Greg. He is smart and he challenges me intellectually. He is also a great dancer and an awesome kisser. I just dont know if I want a man in my life. I've developed this weird fear of men when it comes to intimacy. Things are a bit different with Greg, probably because he's not acting like he is in love with me. I wonder when he will call again....  Other then that, I am actually considering meeting up with Internet friends at the lesbian bar on Saturday. I'll probably chicken at the out last minute.  I'm going to try my best not to over-think the Greg thing. Or the girl thing. Or anything for that matter."
ndf,You meet a man   And realize he's been in your dreams   Although you've never seen him before   He stands in front of you now   And yet   He doesn't see you the way you see him      You seem invisible   You check to see if you're still there   You see a motionless body and a sad face   You see pain and you know you're there   And yet   You still seem invisible      You talk to this dream man   Is he listening?   What are you saying?   The salty wetness runs down your face   And yet   Your skin is dry      He opens his mouth   Is he going to say something?   Does he know you're there?   You become eager for what happens next   And yet   He just yawns      You turn around and begin to walk away   Your face is red and embarrassed   Your heart is full of shame   Your dreams are shattered   And yet   He follows you      Where are you going?   Why is he following you?   You look behind you   He turns around and walks the other away   And yet   You can't move      You watch him walk away   He becomes out of sight   You can move again like a bird   You walk in the opposite direction of him   And yet   You can only dream
ndf,"Well, last night it stormed something fierce. Thunder, lightning and tons of rain. It sure made a nice evening to crochet. I finished with the 6th square now, and have started the one with the cluster braid. It is not hard at all, and seems to be going fairly quickly. I like this part. I will try to finish this one today. I have a terrible headache, so I don't know how much I will get to do.  I am working on my squares in the order, going down the left, in strips. Once I have 9 squares done, in the first row, I will attach them together and begin to really see some progress. It only has 7 strips, so once you get one done, it will go smoothly from then on out.  Well, until next time - happy crocheting from my hook to yours!"

ndf,"It's the middle of summer and I can't sleep, I haven't talk to my friends in a while I wonder what they been up to. Anyways I've leaned something this summer about me. One thing being why I feel depressed and why I get irritate easily. I've discovered that when I'm not with a crowd of people I don't feel depressed or get irritate easily. Which is like my brother which sucks because all school is a crowd of basically adults acting like 6 year olds."
ndf,"Been sg for so long, never been Esplanade... Finally, last night went there with my best friend. at first, i thought i will be deadly late then i sms her and told her that i might be late. who knows she just took the train right before me! so after she alight a while, i be there with her! feel like luckly...  then we planned to dine at foodcourt... walk walk walk... foodcourt seems disappear... so we asked the security guard. He told us that the foodcourt vanish since month ago... with no choice, we go McD, both ordered McWing... four tiny chicken and french fries and one cup of coke...  when we were Esplanade, it was already 8:30pm. The Nyoba Dance was showing... dont know wat they acting .. like typical japanese weird movie style.. Really feel like ""gui3 yi4"" There is one scene that the man with the fake horse walk straight. All of us thought it will stop before the edge... who knows it just walk walk walk and go through the audience. Those sitting audience quickly stand up and move away. For those standing of course just ""dan hoi""(canto) la  After the show, we watch New Asia performance. The Indian drummer really terro~~ He called as Kamar. The speed and his finger strength really incredible! I fancy the another modern drummer. Tama Goh dont know i spell it correct or not... later check out his detail...i mean i will try  He looks like so serious and when he play drum he kept looking at Kamar direction! I feel like he is challenge kamar when he played the drum as solo performance.  Really a nice trip... can meet up with my best friend."
ndf,"Ok, it's the weekend before my first exam! Biology...hmm I did 6 hours of study today, 3 practice exams, and I still have to learn the theory more thoroughly! Stupid viruses...meanwhile, i'm waiting for my mum to bring the pizza home, so toodles!"
ndf,"Ever been bogging?  Put on a pair of old sneakers, clothing you don't mind getting wet and lets go for a walk.  As you step out onto the bog it is like stepping out onto a waterbed made of moss.  Your feet sink into the ground as water fills in the whole. It is a creepy but wild experience.  If you dare you can walk right out till you are waste high or go over your head.  Now you may ask what does this have to do with a Blog?  Absoultely nothing but being as much of an environmental science nut as I am, it was the first thing that jumped into my mind...  So feel free to bog around!  Enjoy!!"
ndf,"So how many blogs do I have now? Let's count...probably 4, and I usually only use one which is Dead Journal. But hey, I want a new taste...so I'm gonna use blogger again. For the 3rd time? lol   It was (still is) very windy today. I like this cool breeze...although it was really hot today.   The moment I got up today I knew I was going to have a good day, cuz I woke up briskly and eager to go to Saturday School. But now that I think about it...today was a REALLY tiring day. The most tiring day I've ever had at Saturday School maybe. I mean HAL!! Hal is SO GODDAMN loquacious! (Hahah, there goes my vocab again...) He would NOT shut up!! We did show and tell again and he would make either a sarcastic remark or a ""Oh I have that"" to everything everyone says. YOU SMARTASS!! And then for HIS show and tell, guess what he gets out... fossils and anmonites.  He even made this presentation-board type of thing. And he talks back to me, says mean things that he doesn't mean, etc...that kid absolutely drives me  mad.  But what the hell, at least he's somewhat entertaining...half the laughter in that class is caused by Hal's smartness (and stupidness...today he said 'Stupidity counts in everything.' Daresama yanen...lol) . Talked to Victor today, was nice...he's so cute, hehe. It's so weird how my heart jumps whenever I see him. But his hideous sense of BAGS and HATS are disturbing...lol I guess he likes that military color combination...  Yusuke, Hiroaki, and I were gonna go to a movie tonight but since we found out it ends at 9:05, we cancelled it...plus we might not have gotten tickets, we were planning to see  Day After Tomorrow . That comes out today! So then we planned to go out to dinner, but since I finish work at 5 we postponed that as well. lol   Apparently I might be going to prom with Hiroaki...? Yusuke and Jyongri persuaded him to go with me, and it might just happen! It all depends on if he has the whole outfit though, I hope he does. Well whatever, I'm not too concerned with going dateless after all. As long as we all have a good time...  Speaking of packing, I leave in  15 days!!!  Do you read that Courtney, I'LL BE IN THE SAME GODDAMN COUNTRY IN 15 DAYS! I'll be sure to give you a call when I get to Indiana kk? ;) Ahhhh I'm so excited...XD XD   I must go do homework now. Adios amigos."
ndf,"Hello,      I am trying this blog thing for the first time, I kinda like the idea of it... today has started off pretty good, I still have to vacum the house... yesterday was a great day... unfortunatly the voices in my head keep on telling me to do things, things they have never told me to do before... they used to always tell me to kill and to hurt... but now they are trying to help me I think, you see, yesterday I went to the mall with my girlfriend, and we went and saw a movie together. My voices only come out in the dark and it happened to be just dark enough in the theater for me to hear them. Throught the whole movie they were telling me to do stuff like, put my arm around her, kiss her, stuff like that... sometimes it got plain disturbing the things they told me (I won't repeat them...) but overall yesterday was an awesome day... last night though, when I got home, they ""punished"" me for the times that I wouldn't listen to them... they were screaming inside my head that I am worthless, that I have no chance of having a real life if I refuse to listen to them... and last night I had a dream about what it would have been like had I listened to them... I don't know what to do... I think that they are trying to trick me to trusting them so that they can eventually have me do things that I will really regret... but I don't know... also... my girlfriend's ex, Richie (grr... must... kill..), keeps on telling her that she has to break up with me and start talking to him again in order for her to have a chance of getting back into thespians, god, I truly do hate him... he is using things that I can't stand that I said against me now... and it really get's to my girlfriend... god, I love her so frigin much... but I just don't know what to do sometimes... I think, hell, I know she still has feelings for him... but I couldn't confront her about them in a million years... my best friend, kevin, thinks that I should break up with her... but god, i just couldn't bear to do such a thing... well, I'd better go... I've got more to write, I may post again later tonight..."
ndf,"Wow. I can't believe how fast the summer's gone by. But WAIT! It's NOT over yet!! You know, if I was in school right now, the next 2 weeks and 1/2 would be a really long vacation. So I have to keep thinking that way. Not  School's almost here,  but  2&1/2 week Holiday.  Hey, that's longer than Christmas break. I'm not too anxious or whatever about starting again, it's just the same old, same old to me. I always like to get new clothes! That's the fun part, of course. Everyone is so scared about seeing people again. It's only been 3 months! Not three years! And like, who really cares what ppl think about you. So I don't look totally different.~ So what? I've given up on the whole must-try-harder-to-improve-my-look craze, I just wear what I like  ; have my hair and make-up the way I want it. I remember in 8th grade I would wake up at a quarter to 6 sometimes so I could get my face and hair just right. Now I wake up at 6:30, and spend a 30 minutes on all of that. (mostly because it's early and it takes forever to wake up) Anyway, I'm rambling.. as usual."

ndf,Hey how is everyone. Heather has moved here and we are doing really well. We  spent 17 hours in the car this past weekend going to my friend Jared's  wedding and we will be going to Jessica's wedding theis weekend. we haven't  killed each other so that is really impressive. I am a little tense about  the wedding but I guess that is good otherwise I would probably be terrible.  I guess I still might.  Heather is doing really well.  She has been handling the move well even though I know she misses her  friends back in Colorado.  I am considering taking a Youth Ministry position at Fellowship of the  Metroplex. It is a fairly large church wich I am not a big fan of but I am  praying over with Heather and we need your prayers to help us with the  decision. We are also considering some other options of ministry and would  appreciate your prayers. Thanks for everyone's help and support.  Jake

ndf,"Well I have been working on this damn thing for the last four months straight, no days off not even weekends, and the end is rapidly approaching.  Friday the 2nd I get to defend this damn thing.  Though my advisor keeps reassuring me I have nothing to worry about, I cant help but shake the feeling that something bad might happen.  Nothing would suck more than spending 3 years busting your ass in a lab, and then not get your masters (or more years and PhD, but thats not the case here). Maybe its just stress.  It may be the fact that I still haven't found a job yet.  Whatever it is, I can not wait to get this over with on Friday, spend the evening with friends, and then start planning for the rest of my life."

When I get like eighty something i'm still going to be watching them, i'm not never going to get tired of watching them. Well Bye"
ndf,"Some days I feel so bloody old. It's the way I remenisce over old times and experiences I had when I was younger. And I think it's the fact that I do this so oftern is what makes me feel like a bit of a dinosaur. Maybe I'm being overly aware of the changes that have occurred over the last few years. I'm 26 and that's really nothing in the scheme of things. But I had such a crazy time from 16-22, 23 that I can't help but sometimes feel in awe of the times I've had.  I imagine alot of us go through it but I seem to be the only who keeps talking about it.  I think I'm a narcissist. I think I think about what I think about way too much. Am I overly concerned with the way I perceive myself? Why do I always have to feel ""good"" about every situation. Even when I'm with a person, when we part I always feel the need to make the parting ""smooth and clean"".  No awkward goodbyes and whatnot. But then I think that because I'm already anticipating the situation that makes it awkward. Anybody else ever feel like that?  Why do I always have to find the things that I think are wrong with me and then make a strategy of how I""m going to combat and resolve those inequities? How good it would feel to say: I'm selfish, I smoke too much pot, I'm cheap, I always need things to be 'even'  AND THAT'S HOW I AM. DONE. No plan, no outline to correct my traits gone awry. I bet people live like that. It must be fucking great! And very freeing....  We took grandma out for lunch today to celebrate her 78th birthday. I wrote on her card: P.S. You don't look a day over 50!!  I thought it was rather clever and tongue in cheek for a variety of reasons. In fact I thought it funner to say 50 as opposed to 20 seeing as 20 is such a stretch it's not conceivable. Either way i don't think grandma got it. ""oh, we better not let anyone see this"" was her response. Shit, then I felt like an asshole and even when were at lunch I kept thinking about how uncool it was, and I couldn't shake the feeling that everything wasn't perfect and smooth. Aya.  Gram gave me a slew of goodies, and I've finally got something from the family to hold onto. Thank God"

ndf,"Being really bored again... I shall post.    Yesterday I went on a date with Elise. We went to see King Arthur. The theatre was nearly empty because it was 4pm on a Tuesday, but these two fat men sat a seat away from us. I think I counted 7 other people in the whole theatre. Not to mention one of these guys got on his cell phone for about 30 minutes. HOLY SHIT!!! I swear, some people need to be shot. Anyways, after the movie we sat in the parking lot debating about where to eat. Of course Elise refused to contribute, except for places within eyesight, so I had to choose. We finally went to Orlando's  where we proceded to eat overpriced (but very very good)  food. Afterwards we went to Elise's mom's house cuz her mom had made a chocalate cake. I stayed for about an hour then went home. I would have stayed longer, but I didnt want to overstay my welcome (especially since I havent been there in quite some time). All in all, I think the whole thing went pretty good.   Today I woke up at noon, which I HATE doing, but I was so tired. Yesterday I had to wake up really early to take Olivia to someone's house cuz my dad was going out of town. He goes out of town almost every week for his job. Olivia goes over to one of my dad's friend's house so I dont have to be chained down watching her. There are 4 other kids there which she gets along with fairly well, but she always wants to come home. Go figure. Our house is so boring.   Well, I gotta go figure out what to make for dinner. I didnt plan on Olivia being home so everything is frozen. Dinner should be interesting tonight."
ndf,haa..nv tot i would start doin such stuff... but anyways.. here i am bloggin... haa.. im just bored... haa(=
ndf,"That's right, I've started a blog.  What led me to do this? Fucked if I know. Basically it gives me a way to take my anger out on the world in a civilised, punctual fucking manner.  I don't know what is to come next."
ndf,ok what the hell is wrong with u when u r a geek and yet u can't help but have feelings for some1 totallyout of ur league? u see i really like alex but tasha likes him and britt likes him and alyssa likes him. all of which are far cooler than me so if ne one's out there give me one reason y alex would want to be more than just friends.
ndf,"So we have 6 1/2 days left of school. I can't wait for it to be over. Yeah, so I just got home from school and it was soooo boring. I'm waiting for my friends to get online. Well, someone juss got online so I'll ttyl. Love,Chloe"
ndf,"I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to write about on here. So I am just going to write about what I am thinking. I'm leaving for college in 8 days. I'm pretty scared because I have a great boyfriend that I have been dating for almost a year and two months. He is going to college about two hours away from me. We are both playing basketball so I'm not sure if we will be able to see each other much during the season. I am majoring in biology but I'm not sure what type of career I want to have.     Well I have been looking around this site and I can't find out how to look at other blogs. I guess I'm ""blog illiterate."" It doesn't really matter to me though. I don't mind if nobody reads this. I like being able to write about my feelings. I kind of actually feel like a dork for doing this. Oh well. Nobody will know!"
ndf,"Today I got my Orange belt in Choi Kwang Do. The last ""light"" colored belt before Green which goes into the darker colored belts. I took the pictures tonight of the belt ceremony using my wife's Fuji S2. Sharp camera! Since I am an asst instructor I am now teting every month. I have my patterns down through Green belt, and plan on learning Blue and Purple patterns this week. :)  This weekend I did my first ""non-official"" videography event - a ""reception"" party for a couple that was married in Hawaii several months ago. Luckily it did not rain since it was an outside event. :) I took about 2 hours of film. I would think that a wedding would have actually been easier since there are actual ""events"" that you have to capture. This was basically just a party and therefore I became more the voyeur than the observer like normal weddings in that I had to walk around taping interesting converstaions. Luckily the bride & groom both have very outgoing personalities as do most of their close friends. My wife was the photographer (http://oneclickawayphoto.com) so in some cases I followed her around. But as the night wore on and the drinks became more potent I was able to pull out some interesting stories from some of the key attendees. Though I was really wanting Grandma to participate but she did not like the idea of being taped. Must be a generational thing. :)  Have you ever had a mental image of someone you worked with over long distances, but then when you actually met them or saw their picture realized your image was WAY off base? Had that happen today. Man - talk about being wrong. :)   Anyway - I'm off to play XBox. Later!"
ndf,"I'm sitting in a wading pool in Paul's backyard on a sweltering 100 degree day in Portland. Tomorrow I leave for the San Juan islands on a two week trip with 12-14 year olds. I am savoring every moment of relaxation I have in my thirty-six hours off, though it is always difficult to resist the call of the lengthening to-do list.  In college Cynthia and I were going to make a think tank called Brains in a Vat. We would lie around thinking and writing and solve the world's problems. Right now I don't feel like I have very many solutions to the world's problems, but if I could sit around all day and think I would surely come up with something phenomenal. The blogger address brainsinavat.blogspot was taken, which makes me wonder if someone else is usurping our idea. I had to take Brains in a Jar. Too bad. What will I do if they are conservative assholes using ""Brains in a  Vat""? Closed-minded, tightass brains in a vat. I bet their logo isn't as nice as ours. I can see it now: Brains in a Jar versus Brains in a Vat. Two thinktanks battling head to head for funding. I guess if they can solve the world's problems before we can, I should commend them.  Thirty-seven days left of my job. My mom suggeested that I count them down on my calendar to make the time seem more manageable. Thirty-seven days seems very far from manageable right now. I know I can do it and I know that I am helping them out by giving so much advanced notice, but some days I kick myself for not just giving two weeks notice like everyone else in America.  Paul's last day at work is July 31. I have guilt pangs about us both being unemployed at the same time because I know how that must look to our employers. I didn't quit my job to have time for Paul. I quit my job to have time for me. For my health. For grad school. For my future.  But they don't know that.  And it sure is going to be nice . . ."
ndf,"I write a blog on the 22/08/04 and someone write a comment on the blog. Wat she say was quit rit and i agree but i still cannot make up my mind if to give up anot.

ndf,"I've got to go watch my favorite television shows, so I'll be brief.    As a conservative, I'm more than a little fed up with the liberal bias in the media. Disgusted isn't really the right word-I'm disgusted with the blatant anti-Americanism of the flag-burning war protestors, I'm disgusted with the self-absorbed corruption at the UN-but the media bias...it can best be compared to a child singing an annoying song, incessantly, over and over again. They're AWARE that they're injecting bias into their news. They're AWARE that it's wrong. However, they're not going to stop doing it...because on one level, the annoying song-singing child enjoys singing the song, on another, it enjoys annoying the people around it. Eh, that's the best comparison I can come up with on such short notice.   Perusing the internet a couple of years back, I came across this wonder of wonders: THE BLOG. Conservatives around the nation had taken opportunity of this new miracle of technology to protest the liberal media. Good for them.   Since then, both the media and the celebrities around the nation have turned up the heat on their criticism of Bush, all the while proclaiming that there was a 'chill wind' of repression silencing them. Such sheer pretentiousness on their part served to give me a headache for a few hours, but nothing more.   However, they've begun to go to far. They've gone beyond the realm of 'bias' into the realm of 'propaganda.' I realized this after I was able to deconstruct the basis of a Time magazine article ('How we got Homeland Security wrong) with a calculator, access to google, and no more than five minutes of my own time. When something like this happens-when a trusted and widely read magazine starts putting out bullshit that can be disproved with eighth-grade research and math skills...well, things have gotten pretty bad.   Instead of sitting around and bitching about it, I've decided to throw my weight into the fight, by starting this blog. Whenever I can, I'll point out liberal media innaccuracies. Whenever I want to, I'll write opinion pieces.   However, unlike the mainstream media, I'll be honest with you. This Blog will be replete with right-wing bias, ranging from moderate to, as the media would put it, 'extreme.'   Thank you."
ndf,"It was a cold kind of day. The kind of cold kind of day that makes you chilly if you happen to be out side without warm clothes on. That is how cold it was. And, it just so happens that a character in this story happened to be out side on this cold day without any warm clothes on. In fact, he was not wearing any clothes at all. For that reason, and other reasons too, it was imperative that he find shelter immediately. Or soon there after. He had never experienced a day like this before. Ever before. Never in his lifetime before. He hopes to never experience anything like this again. but is what he hopes for really what is best for him? Only time will tell. This is the story of a man. Of a boy. Of a legend that no has heard of. Of a hero that no one knows. It will make you laugh. It will make you cry. You will read it from start to finish. You will not be able to put it down. You just wait. You will think you are just reading a book. You should know better. You will soon realize, the book is reading you.  He was running through the snow like a blind man. All he could see was white. Endless white. Everywhere he turned. Everywhere he fell. No matter where he looked. All there was, was white. The poor boy. He went flying as he tripped over a particularly bumpy patch of white. Over the cliff he went. Into the void. He fell for what seemed like only seconds, but really days passed as he fell. What could he do though, besides fall? Well really quite a lot, but how was he to know? If he had read the instructional manual before he took the plunge he would have known that in order to stop falling, all he had to do was simply to stop."
ndf,"love studying?   can't get enough of those fat books and those manic profs.?  well, you are a rare species, but there is no need to worry,"
ndf,"Bored, so why not post again. Nothing exciting going on. Went to my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary sunday, that was worse then getting teeth pulled. Spend monday and most of tuesday at the uncle's house. May move in there after school starts, we'll see. Already have my own room and bathroom there, plus a dresser full of clothes that are mine. So, it's worth looking into. New school, but, hey why not. Tomorrow hanging out with some people got lucky and have thursday off too. Who knows what Ill do. More later."
ndf,"I just got back from seeing the movie I, Robot starring Will Smith.  Let's just say I was just a tidge disappointed in the movie.  First of all, when I heard that this movie was coming out I picked up the book (not the misleading one with Will Smith on the cover).  I was fascinated by the book in the fact that it was a series of vignettes about the evolution of robots from mindless machines to a species equal to ours, all shown through the eyes of a robot pschoanalyst.  I thought these stories were amazing and saw a definite flow to all the unlinked stories.  This made me very intriqued about how the movie was going to be.     I had read that Alex Proyas was going to take liberties with the plot, but keep Isaac Asimov's vision intact.  I believe he failed, miserably.  What Mr Proyas made was just another unbelievable action movie that appeal to the dense overly stimulated action freak with none of the intended vision to what he speaks of.  It is sad really there was so much emotion and cerebral moments that were lots in the mindless CGI and laws of physics bending fight sequences that have been over used by ever movie since the first Matrix.  In fact they should have called this a Matrix prequal that George Lucas would have been proud of (including the apparently useless sidekick kid from Even Stevens that didn't have to do with anything in the story except a cheap laugh, can you say JAR-JAR).       There was some redeeming value, there was some witty dialogue that kept the plot interesting.  But of course, like all Will Smith movies, there was far too many pointless one-liners.   Another point was the fact that the leading lady wasn't just some no brain supermodel which was hard to believe that she actually could read the script (Denise Richards in The World is Not Enough), but they found some one less than perfect who was actually believable though still too young to be a brilliant scientist.       Overall the movie was entertaining, but not something that Asimov would have been proud to go see."
ndf,"So we did the Oklahoma thing.  It was actually a very beautiful lake.  On Saturday, as soon as we got into OK, it started pouring.  We were worried that our fun-filled weekend would be ruined because of the rain.  We had nothing to do.  We decided to see DODGEBALL, which was silly.  When we came out of the movies, the sun was out and the sky started to clear.  We dashed over to the lake to rent a kayak.  It was really nice and not too hot since it had been raining all day.  We then ate dinner at a local restaurant.   Sunday's weather was better.  My husband enjoyed the scuba diving, though it was not my cup of tea.  I am not certified and just sat on the shore, under the trees, trying to avoid the sun.  I told him that I might not go with him the next time he decided to dive, since it is not very interesting for me.  I know he enjoys it so much, but is definitely not a spectator sport.   I am teaching classes in a summer program for high school students.  It is going well, though some of the kids don't seem to care very much about the program.  They seem to be determined to get kicked out of the program (which will provide college tuition upon successful completion ).  I don't know.  Hopefully these kids will wake up and realize that this is a unique opportunity before they are removed.  I know that they deal with difficult stuff at home - things that I never had to deal with. . . ."
ndf,"Geuss what? I just realised how great I am at reviewing movies. Remember when I saw that one about the British ravers who contacted the undead via an Oujia [I've never had to spell that word] board? The one about the kids who snorted coke [cocaine, for those of you who aren't Ma-, er, down with the street speak] off train tracks when, wait for it, A TRAIN WAS COMING?  I also liked how they had sex, and the girl's shirt was on inside out for the rest of the film. Oh, but I wish I had seen all of it. Obviously, something that starts off like that must have a grand finale. But my mum wrestled the remote off me with a stern ""No more tacky B-grade films about British punks!""  But they weren't punks, mum. They were ravers.  The whole experiance left me hungary for more B-grade films. The 'B' in 'B- grade' stands for 'Brilliant', right? Oh, good. Anyway- Blurred.   IT HAD EVERYTHING.  A deformed freak who picked up hitchikers, playing a recording of a woman having multiple orgasms, in his wagon of death?  Hillbillies eating lasange?  Threesomes in a limo? The driver wearing a cocktail dress?  A stripper-hating nerd who fails to find true love?  Some ugly bitch who picked up an even uglier bitch [male, this time] and attempts sex with him? Several times?  Gothic girls on acid?  One of those great endings where they freeze on the face of each character and the text at the bottom of the screen tells you what happened to them after ""schoolies""?  IT. HAD. EVERYTHING. Am I one to be sarcastic? Exactly. See this film. Or the first one I raved about. Hahaha -RAVED.  Until the next time I go wild at the video store..."
ndf,"Okay, so I decided to start a Blog. I remember a few years back when some friends of mine were doing the ""blog thing"" and I didn't really care for it. But recently a friend of mine told me I should be keeping a journal of all the craziness that goes on in my life...so here it is."
ndf,"well.. it's later in the day time.. and what i did was watch viva la bam, cuz i'm in LOVE with BAM MARGERA!:) .. and then i went to bed, but then whitley called, and then she came and got me, and we went to the mall to shop 4 her outfit 4 our choir concert 2moro night... no luck! we left the mall early becuz i was supposed to be home at 5 to clean before church.. but then when i got home, my mom called and sed that she had to work longer than she thot, so we're not going to church now.. i have to clean here in a little bit, becuz i've had all day to, and haven't yet.. cuz i'm TOO TIRED! .. oh yeah, and then i have to do laundry.. cuz its SUNDAY, and that's what i do during the SUNDAY STEW on Music television!(MTV)... well, i better get to cleanin now.. hasta la pasta, baby!"
ndf,"While I was reading other friends' blogs that I realized to just be myself... I really don't think I've ever done that before, not in the 14-almost 15- years that I've been alive.  It's hard to imagine, I know, but it's true!  Zac's writing awakened me... he showed me, not trying to, how to be myself.  So here it goes:  I like a guy, named Eric and supposebly he likes me back the same way-according to Erin.  I just hope he didn't lie and was telling the truth... I've been hurt and I don't want to be hurt again.  I'll post tomorrow. ~Paranoia"
ndf,Ok so boys are a major part of my life so I am going to be posting many blogs about them! First if there are guys out there reading this then I want to say that girls (in general) don't like to make the first move and surely hate to not know how a guys feels! I am actually turned on when a guy is able to express himself to me. Second I want to tell of something that has happened to me in the past. I hate it when guys are not able to act themselves if there is something between us. How immature is that...really. Then if a guy has a grudge against a girl I can't stand it how they center their lives around it and try to get back at them by getting on other girls and stuff. Once again that just proves they are immature and obviously don't know what they are doing. So guys learn to make the first move on a girl and get over the akwardness between girls and boys!!
ndf,"Hi there, my name as you can see, is Brock.  I've been looking everywhere for a place for me to express myself, Thank you blogger.com.

ndf,"I understand     It is defined by truth and reality, it is not the love I feel for you that is truest, and it is my action in response to that love.  I love you because in china a butterfly flapped its wings.  I love you because the centrifugal force of the earth’s rotation makes me.  I love you because you are whole and sane and so beautiful it hurts to touch you.  I love you because at night your sweet dreams move your body closer to mine, skin touching for days it seems.  I love you because when I wake next to you and the sun shines over our bodies, Mother Nature tells me this is the most natural thing I can ever have.  Human life is but a mili-second in the big picture so there is no time to waste.  In the morning you smell of sweet vanilla when I press my face into your neck.  Your breasts curving so gracefully, I watch the lines of your body and try to memorize them.  Your fingers so soft and strong…not to dainty and not to hard.  It’s the kind of thing you wish for when you are single, or at least when I was single, and lucky enough I got what I wanted, no less and no more.  At night when you wrap your legs around me I almost melt.  Your sweet lips covering me like a cotton sheet of sweet desire.  True is your love for me."

Who reckoned this war thing was a good idea, anyway?  I mean, brainstorm the word WAR...  Bombs, Guns, Bombers, Fighter Jets, Warships, Soldiers, Politics, Religion, Pillaging, Hate, Pain, Theft, Loss, Killing, Murder, Rape, Death, Destruction  Does anyone see anything happy about that list?

ndf,"Dear who ever wants to read this       I am writing this to enlighten you as to the scam that happens to be sms.ac.  I am sure that who ever is reading this has received the email from a friend telling you to sign up for this ""great offer of 6 FREE sms's per day"" tempting, but i was as sure that it was a scam as i am sure that megan wont be capable of sitting down after saturday night.  So i closed the email and not long after found out that tens of my class mates had signed up for the ""deal"". To be fair here are some pros and cons   reasons for joining sms.ac   1. The ""FREE"" deal is obviously great value! 2. I wouldnt want to commit the clear social suicide that is not answering my friends sms's! 3. I have to keep my friends updated with inane jabbering!   resons not to join sms.ac   1. reading the terms and conditions.   Had anyone of these people decided to read the terms and conditions i would not have had to endure them complain about the $6 charge for ""Infomessages"". I got exactly 13 messages telling me to join this site, these emails were sent to countless others, and no doubt a fair few of them joined up for this quality deal! suckers. i feel no pity for you, let this teach you the lesson READ THE FINE PRINT   Todays resolution: The majority of humanity are idiots, however there are a few outstanding citizens leading the pack and unfortunately the majorty of them hail from my school. Enjoy freedom while you can, once they arte released on society they will effectively crush the small part of sane humanity that is left with inane infomercials and ""GREAT DEALS""   USE YOUR TIME WISELY, THERE IS NOT MUCH OF IT LEFT   faithfully sane...                   cube"
ndf,"Jesus.  Great bloke. Great head of hair.   I'm issuing a challange to everyone. To guys lucky enough to be blessed with long locks. To girls looking for something classic yet bold on their ball nights. Print out the following image of Jesus Christ and present it to your hairdresser. Ask them for ""The Jesus"". If they're a decent stylist they'll know what to do.  Why is Jesus' hair so underrated? Check out that colour. So... brown. And the volume! My god. Don't even get me started on the parting.  On second thoughts, I can't be bothered posting the image. You all know what Jesus looks like. And if you don't, consult your bible."
ndf,Well right now I am about to eat (yum) so I will make this a bit shorter than normal especially becauce I had a boring day. I woke up at 6:30 am :( and I at some breakfast and started to fiddle with my computer trying to get the network/internet in our new house to work. I had to work till noon cutting up the hundreds of boxes we used to move which is ok because I love my sharp knife :P The rest of the day I spent trouble shooting my home network trying to get it working with WEP encryption which most people will not know...
ndf,This is my first post and I don't know what to put here. I'm just making a blog in the hope that google would give me a gmail account so that I can change the email I used in yahoo with that of google because of the immense storage capacity.
ndf,"I'm soooo glad i'm not an 8th grader anymore! lol I'm gonna do a lot of things this summer... the first thing i'll probably do is go to the Queen of all Saints' Fest soon.  I haven't been there for awhile like 5+ years ago. lol I'm also gonna make A LOT of memories this summer! lol Nice year i'm gonna look totally different you what and see(hopefully, probably!) I'm gonna probably get my first job this summer, be turning 15 on june 27th and be having loads of fun with friends! lol I think this summer will be way different then the past summers!   ~Excited!!"
ndf,"Super Smash Bros. Melee is my most favorite game in the world. It is a four-player fighting game that has super simple moves compared to other fighting games. However, don't think that it is an easy game to beat and no fun to play. You still must master moves for a character just like you would for any other fighting game. You have to know when to sidestep dodge, jump, and attack your opponent. You have to know when to roll behind and when to retreat. Only true master can beat Giga Bowser and the Master and Crazy hand!  Not only do you have to beat Classic, Adventure, and All-Star mode, you also have to beat all the event matches and get all 290 trophies! This is a must have for any Gamecube owner, and that means YOU! Buy it now! I am saying this out of my own love towards the game, and I am not a walking advertiser :)  Recently, there was a Melee Tournament in our area, and out of two and a half pages worth of people, guess who came out first...ME! I got hoards of stuff! I love being the best at Melee! Surprisingly, they never got me down to one life! It consisted of many three life stock battles. I brought my memory card and they let me use it because they had NO characters. I have 100 percent beaten that game.  Also, I have kept a profile name. It has over 1000 wins and around fifty losses. No, I play my brothers and Level 9 CPUs. I stopped the playing timer at 9,999:59! That's around 163 hours, and I know that I played more than that! I am a freak of this game and have emailed Nintendo multiple times on when the next Super Smash will come, but they said there has been none announced. If you know PLEASE TELL ME. I hope the DS will have the game. Just think... PORTABLE SUPER SMASH!!!  If you think you can beat me in Melee, I think I can beat you. You may not be easy, but I'm trying to become the best in the world! Come talk to me If YOU LOVE SUPER SMASH BROS. MELEE!!!!  I also have the original Super Smash Bros., but I think it's nothing compared to Melee. All you have to do in that game is throw. It's fake, but I still like it. You can talk to me about that too.  Dr. Mario is cheap!"
ndf,"once i was sitting in the school hall having the first pe lesson,then i was looking around.when the teachers were preparing the stuff for the lesson,i spotted a girl at the oppsite side of my class.I watched her and cared nothing else,by then i realise she was my girl...once i met her at a bus stop,she was with her stead,but i didn't know that that was her stead.Thus i sat at a seat behind them,and heard what are they talking about.then as time flies,each time i looked at her,the more i liked her even more.Then,at mid august,i finally got the courage n asked her for stead,i was that surprised that she accpted me.then it lasted for a week,plus a day.we broke up, she didnt want to hurt me,cuz she had her ex in mind.somewhere at the last day of school,i asked her for stead again then we patched up for 3 days and broke up again.because of the sparse communication..when school reopened,we tried to act like nothing happened.but we still can't forget that we had the past together,we were like steads,we act like one,and we got even closer to each other.On the 27th july,we patched up.then,kelly exposed our relationship,and she was her best friend,also my friend,jac scolded her for doing this,i don't know what happend,and i actually tried to defend kelly.that dy, i sent her home,we were taking bus 105,we sat in the same sit and held hands,we treasured the time we had,and that was only the time we had together alone.but on the 4 of august, we broke up,she told me that she was a bad stead and broke up with me...then finally on the 7th of august she expained why...she again said that she was a bad stead,and her parents n brother knew about our relationship..she wanted to protect me,and she broke up with me..and she does not bare to break up ,she was crying when she told me all this,and there is nothing i could do to help.i can only see her tears rolling down her cheeks.then she took her bag and ran out of the school,i felt helpless,and started wiping..i hated the world to be so unfair to us..all we wanted i a stable relationship and nothing else..but in the end..we still have to go seperate ways...and each time i thought of she saying...i don't want to break up but i have no choice...tears will start rolling down my eyes..i did not give up once,i will wait for the right time..i will always keep her in my mind forever..."
ndf,"Things I want to know:  1)  WTF is wrong with this place? 2)  Why do you continually piss me off each and every time I try to get to my blog? 3)  When am I going to find someplace else??  *grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr*  Not that I am not aggravated enough already today.  I'm so sleepy thanks to a certain someone who kept me up well past my bedtime last night (you know who you are :p).  Not that I'm *complaining* lol....but I am sleepy.  Going to bed RIGHT after I watch the Sox tonight.  Well, unless someone beans Eric Byrnes and gives him a concussion or some stiches.  Then I'll be up partying all night :D  God, I hate that man.  You do NOT shove Jason Varitek and expect not to make my list.  OMG.....my son has learned to swim.  Good GOD he surprised the SHIT out of me this weekend!  We went to my sister's down in Massachusetts for the 4th.  Last time I watched this kid try to swim was mid-June....he was getting it but not quite there.  He BLEW ME AWAY over the weekend. Jumped right into the over-his-head water and away he went, swimming from one side of the pool to the other....under water even.  If you know my kid....you know the whole underwater thing - HUGE deal.  **proud mommy**  I totally forgot the kid was due at summer school today too...he goes 5 weeks a summer to get help with his reading.  I don't think he needs it anymore (he really did last year but he is pretty much in the appropriate place at this point), but if they are going to give it to him....I'm going to let them.  Extra help's never a bad thing lol...anywho, I totally forgot that he was supposed to start today and I never sent him....he's with his aunt all day at my nephew's track meet.  Prolly a good thing tho....seeing as I forgot to call the bus company and tell them where to pick him up ANYWAY lol  *sigh*  I'm rambling.  Whatever.  I'm at work and I am caught up and bored as shit.  I have a *huge* project to start that's not a big priority so of course....I don't want to do it lol.  I guess I should tho...they do pay me.  I think I'll check my email first tho....then maybe my messageboards....make a phone call....dammit, I really need a nap."
ndf,"O  k, so you ever have those days where you just feel like shit? I am having a bad one today. My Grandmother is in the hospital dying and has been for the last few days. But because of my work I haven't been able to be there much. So, I went to work this morning and just felt horrible being there. It was actually making me ill. So, I left at lunch, and now I feel guilty about leaving. Oh well, I think a day will help me. I need some time to process things. And I will do a shift at the hospital tonight with my mom. I just really wish there was something I could do. I hate being helpless. Fuck, this sucks."
ndf,"Well, I bought my plane ticket back to Flint yesterday. It's going to be nice to see my family again. Of course, as soon as I had my ticket I talked to my sister and learned that home sweet home has become more disturbing than ever. It's hard for Flint to shock me--we're talking about a city that considered selling the trees in its parks for lumber, but I'm actually starting to get scared. A friend's cousin was beaten to death in his car in front of his eight-year-old son. One of the editors at the magazine my sister writes her vegan cooking column for was beaten to near-death and left in the street. Oh, and two women were found dead, one downtown and the other near Mott Park. Mott Park for God's sake! My favorite neighborhood in Flint. Where I always wanted to live. Where I went to school. Where my sister and brother-in-law just bought a house. I always look forward to going home, but this time I'm getting an ominous, horror-movie feeling. I'm learning to appreciate Mankato more and more. I think I'll just stay in Flint long enough to see  Hamlet  (which I'm sure will be excellent) and then I'll head to the Saint Clair River Delta, relax on the island and watch the freighters float by. Oh and play with as many dogs as possible before I come back to No-pets-in-every-lease-ville, U.S.A."
ndf,"Hi you, this is me. Me, this is you.  Now that introductions are over, I'm gonna give you a chance to get to know me. Don't screw this up, or yknow, nothing will happen. I think I should point out that this is my first blog ever. and it's something I decided to do on a whim at 8 o clock on a Sunday night after I basically got fired from my job.  Oh, did I pique your interest?  Well if I did, here's what happened. Yesterday, I called in and told them I would be picking up my two weeks notice, this got miscommunicated as ""Hey, I'm quitting right now"" and as I went in today, I was asked ""Didn't you quit."" Anywho, to make a long story short, I ended up in a mixture of quitting/getting fired.   Im fine with it, I have to start school in a couple week anyway.  But that's in the past, and Im sure no-one reading this is interested in my past, only what might future might hold, and exactly where my present lies.  So here's the present: I'm a guy. I have a girl. Me and said girl just got gerbils on Saturday. The gerbils names? Cactus Jack Daniels and Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves. They're outlaws! :)  I am unemployed as of today and going back to school in a couple of weeks. I've never been especially good in school, but not because I'm dumb. It's because I've never decided to go through the effort of doing anything in class, or at home for that matter. I guess that is pretty dumb. For what it's worth though, I ace all my exams.  The girl, y'know, the one I was telling you about before? The on with the gerbils, well, she is my love, and my everything. You'll definantly hear reference to her later in my blogging adventure.    I have just decided that I should change names to protect all of the people involved in my eccentric adventures, y'know, don't want to leave all their things laying about for their mom to find now do we?  I'll decide on names later, but i think the gerbils will get to keep their names as they are. For now however, Jack and Robbie are making a lot of noise, so, I'll post what I have and go attend to them, maybe I'll write something else later."

ndf,"Welcome to my ""Hello World"" post!  I am on a mission!  My wife, whom I couldn't love more if I tried, has had the wonderful luck of having her job relocate us to Orlando Florida!!  YEEEAAAHHHH!    We love Disney World and have been at least twice a year since we were married back in 1991.  We most recently took the Disney cruise and absolutely loved every minute of it.  We have two kids, a boy who is 9 and a girl who is 7, and they both love Disney World as well.  So you can imagine our elation at getting to move to Orland!  Then reality struck us!!  My job doesn't have an office in Florida!  Oh no!  There is no way we could move if I didn't have a job to move down there to (we currently live in Indianapolis IN).  Well I work as an IT Manager/Project Manager so I thought I'd just hit MONSTER and DICE and bingo, the job offers would roll in!  WRONG!  After applying to over 30 job postings I haven't had a single reply of interest.  Ok so the first thing I did was get introspective.  Is it me?  Am I not employable in the year 2004?  Then I thought it was my resume, so I had a professional help me out with that.  He polished it to a fine sheen and I resubmitted it to DICE and MONSTER.  Guess what!!  STILL no hits!  I spoke to a recruiter in Florida who has assured me that I will NOT get any hits because I do not live in Florida!  WHAT!  I'm not even asking for relocation fees!  My wifes job has that covered.  This is so frustrating that I just have to share this with the rest of the world, or whoever reads this that is!  If you are reading this and you can help me, please do and God bless you!  You can contact me at goofybk@insightbb.com.  Even if you can't help me, feel free to email me and we can chat about this frustrating topic.  Can I be the only person looking to move to Florida who is experiencing this?  Please at least let me know that I am not alone here!  I will be posting daily so look for more tomorrow!  I'll close with a little Disney Magic -  ""When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are, you'll never get a job in Florida, if you don't live there!""""

ndf,"Question.   What is this blog about? why's it here? who the hell are you? and why do you think that this deserves to take up valuable internet real estate?   well i'll tell you grasshopper. this blog is a test, a personal test. a test designed to push my own boundaries, and maybe...just maybe bring into being something bigger than just another shitty internet blog.  ultimately, this blog will be a place where i can give wings to my voice and throw open the doors that hold back the whirlwind of emotions and thoughts that dance their way through my headspace. ambiguous enough for you?  on a specific note, i am hoping to eventually provide enough detail about my personality and ideas/ideals that at some point in the future my posts can be used to create a simulacrum of myself. some sort of personality that will capture the essence of what I am about. but that's more of a long term goal.  short term this blog will aim to provide myself with a sounding board for my own thoughts and emotions. a place where I can cry out to my imagined readers and tweak my opinions.  the title of the blog 'generation gap' reflects a deep emotional feeling that I have regarding being labeled by society, and falling down into the generation gap [or generation trap]. hopefully my rantings will address this give the site a 'feel' of changing for the better.  so who the hell am i? i am me! i am someone who is searching. someone who is constantly looking, not sure what he will find, but making the most of the journey of discovery. i am someone who is sick to death of the crap passed down to us by society, in an unconscious attempt to mold us and tell us how to be. i am someone who is trying to push my own boundaries to discover my own mettle and shine in whatever way i can. i am me.  as for why this site should exist, well simply put, cause i want it to. it represents an extention of my will into an infinate void [the interent] where there exists plenty of room for everyone to play. so if you run into this site and don't like it... don't read it, don't come back... sorted. this site exists for me, but if someone else benefits from it then fantastic!  next question."

ndf,"To expand a little on my previous thought.           I spend about 95% of my free time alone.      I am engaged to my childrens father. This is the 3rd time we are engaged.    He wanted to elope, but I feel I deserve a wedding after all that I've been through. We live in different places. I, with the children at my parents house, and him with his mother and family.        His mother had a kidney transplant in December. I understand that he wants to be there for her. But my children and I suffer greatly.  He never comes around. When he does, she (or his sister) calls and he leaves.        Sometimes I think she exaggerates her pain (maybe I sound a little selfish) or maybe exaggerate isn't what I mean. I think she tolerates her pain until she wants attention. I feel bad for her because she suffers alot. But at the same time. I never get to see my ""fiance"" , my kids never get to see their father.     There is a house down the street from her. And the people want around $700    monthly for a 3 bedroom house.  He decided (without me even seeing it) that it wasn't good enough because the house is blue, fiends (drug addicts)   lived   there, and the kitchen is yellow. He can't see taking us from where we are now to move there.        He lives in a 3 bedroom house with about 6 people and a dog. I live in a big 4 bedroom house with my parents, and I am cramped. My son doesn't like to stay here because he thinks my parents don't like him.  My daughter has to stay upstairs with me, because they yell about the house being dirty. She doesn't like it there much either. But he doesn's see moving us from here, because of a freakin yellow kitchen.       I haven't been able to sleep or really eat since he told me this last night.  If anyone can give me a honest opinion on what's really good, I'd really appreciate it."

ndf,"Why is it that when ever something goes wrong or when there is some one to blame I seem to be the one every one turns to. I don't know if it is just me or if there is othere people who feel this way. For me it is hard to deal with and its sad to say, but i'm actullay not looking forward to summer vaction. Summer vaction for me is usually the worst for me because I live a way from all of my friends which means i get to spend the time with my family. The happest for me would probley be at school when i'm around people who don't judge me. My friends known or I try to remind them that what i say that is mean is just kinding around, but thats different here with my family. To me it seems that know matter what i do or what i say i feel like I can never do anything right. I'm not trying to make it seem like my life is all bad or anyhting like that I have good times and bad times but for me it seems that the bad happens more often then the good."

But now, as I browse the blogs of some of my students, a large number of them post quizzes on their sites. I inquired as to why they like these quizzes and most of them replied that these quizzes is sort of personal and delivers a result that they find amusing.

ndf,"It is amazing how the time of lunch comes so slowly. At work the time seems so relative, that I feel like I understand Einstein's theory of relativity, and I could even make my own contribution if I hadn't been so hungy. Sugar levels are dropping. Concentration diminishing.  As I correctly predicted the weekend was indeed cold and rainy and on the weather side really nasty. I have seen all types of rain on that day, and I do not care to see them that soon again. But otherwise the weekend was great. I was training my fiancee in driving on our fresh new car and on Sunday we went to see Kill Bill vol. 2 to another country and it was good.  Today my sister is doing university graduation exams and it seems to be going well. Not for me though, because it is hard to type when you are keeping your fingers crossed :-)"

I love the fact that I have my own office. I put in a work order to have it painted and have some extra junk hauled out of there! So I can personalize it as I please.   On another note. I can't stand Keith the Freecycle South King County moderator. He is so annoying! It is like he only owns the group to rule over people to build his own ego it is so annoying.   Paul, Riley and I went to the Lincoln Park wading pool after work today. It got up to 92 degrees today so it was nice to get our feet wet. Riley really likes wading pools. We just walked around with her. Then we went and had dinner at Spuds and walked along Alki."

Cheated because this fantastic person is being taken from me as soon as I found her."
ndf,"My son's name is Tiger and he has Autism. He is almost 6. He is brilliant, beautiful, sweet, and yet no one out in the world sees that. They see a kid who can't talk, and who squeals alot, especially if he is upset. He has a lot of communication problems, but he has progressed so far since we found out he had a problem to begin with.  There are alot of people who have children with Autism in Plano,TX. I haven't really met anyone who has one like mine. Maybe I am not looking hard enough. I have a 14 yr old step daughter, a 12 yr old daughter, an 8 year old son, Tiger, and a 4 yr old girl. My husband works night. I stay home alot. Its hard to get out and work. Next year when my 4 yr old is in school I may be able to work.   I have always had trouble getting out and meeting people. I am a real homebody and I think my kids hate that. Its very very hard to go out when its just me and the kids. Tiger is loud and strong and loves to run away from me. I love my son to death but some people's reactions to him are hard for me to deal with. Outings with him leave me feeling frustrated that we can't seem to do ""normal"" family activities."

ndf,"I saw her again to day, but nothing more than a passing glance.  What i wouldn't give, to hold that girl...i've written her several songs, she knows how i feel about her.  But sadly, for me, she is already in a relationship.  So i find myself once again lost in this dark spiralling chasm, gasping for breath, hoping yet again to catch a fading glimpse of her beauty.....she's so beautiful.  My story is nothing but a speck in all of history, but it is still my story, and i won't let it end unhappily, i won't stop loving her, if indeed i do love her....there are many definitions of love, mine is wanting to just be near her, nothing more than to see her, but ohh this lonelyness is dark, so very dark...hopefully she will find her way to me, maybe, if i'm lucky...she's so beautiful."
ndf,"I am currently reading a book called ""Prayer Walking"" The concept is to strengthen you body as well as your soul. Hmmm...I think I am going to give this book a try. I do need to prayer more and get a stronger prayer life, and I do need to lose some weight. But in order to do this, I will have to get up early and actually get out there and walk. I think, once I am done with the book, I will actually get started. I will have to let you know how it goes.  Church yesterday was awesome! We had a powerful move of God and a total refreshing swept through the church. It was amazing! During last nights service, I got all the girls in the youth group up at the front dancing and jumping. It was such a great time in the Lord. Those girls are so special and God is doing great things in their lives."

Worse than just the average Monday feeling, I haven't felt any good until just now when I started to think about the days events.  I guess when you reach a rock bottom, the only way is up, so I'm trying to think positive that come tomorrow things will all fit into perspective.   Still not heard anything from Morrisons, although they should have received my letter last Friday.  Not really sure what sort of response I'll get but it has to be better than the response I got from Customer Services last week.  We'll see how it goes.   Spoke to Rob, but felt too miserable to say much.  Looks like an early night for me."

ndf,"an online journal sounds intriguing, if only to keep my thoughts in order. i have long ago given up writing in my journal due to the illegible scribble that is my long hand. the past few years would have made for some good reading and I will regret not having those thoughts to look back on. i suppose i have my memory but even that seems to be failing me in my old age or thru all the drama. drama isn't neccessarily negative but tonight i am wishing for a somewhat drama free past. tonight when i scan the postings of my name via the web, i come accross a memorial to him. someone in his High school class found out that he is dead and they are looking for stories in regards to their beloved fellow student. i sit here, at this desk and the air leaves my chest and isn't replaced for what seems like a great while. a connection to him. a connection to my soul. i miss him so much, i miss my husband, i miss nobles father. i miss sharing with him. laughing. i don't laugh so much anymore and i used to live for laughter. now when i do it seems empty and hollow. i feel fake when i am laughing. maybe the drugs will remedy that. maybe when i laugh again i will feel some connection. maybe this wonder drug will connect it all back in my brain again, but for now it seems all disconnected and although i have pretended that i have been on track for the past few years, i am a liar. my mantra has been ""it's OK"" well it fucking isn't ok, far from OK. i want to tell people that but when i do they run from me. i am always to be the STRONG woman. the strong LEADER. How imressed they all are by my resilliance. well guess what mother fuckers? it is fake. i am crumbling and you don't even know it or if you do, you don't care enough to say a thing. stay away and SUZY will pop back up like a wilted peace lily getting a much needed drink. i wish i could tell them that i am angry and that they too will understand my life when they watch their husbands die of cancer. watch as the man that you love dies while his baby grows in your belly. i was cheated. i was robbed and i have tried to make the best of it. i have waited for the best...it is alluding me. i just want some understanding, a strong shoulder to lay my head upon so that i can rest. i am tired of holding myself up. i am tired of running the show. i am exhausted and weary. where is my stamina in the form of a human?"

I have rediscovered why I don't stage manage any more. I am so bored watching this show. And I would feel bad about sitting there and reading. Grrrr. Well, only 4 more. And if one more actor comes to me with a brilliant idea, I am going to have to kill them. Maybe if they knew all there lines or all there songs or didn't goof things up every night, I would listen to them.

We never seem to spend more than a half an hour--tops together and theres never any conversation. I wish we could talk or see each other but maybe shes just too busy...Guess I'll just have to wait for that one day when I call shes home or she calls me to see her...that one day...somewhere down the road. I came home early tonight to do some make-up work and Im glad to say I at least got some done so hopefully I can pass grammer, I don't know about ICA though those essays seem to be amongst the missing. Well going back to my bed and the one thing I can always count on to be comforting...sleep."

I won't go through the details of what happened but I'm telling you it was hot!"

ndf,"Last night was not our typical Thursday night!  We started the night out with happy hour at Baby A's on Barton Springs Rd. Our friend had her 22nd birthday so we all hung out drinking their signature purple ""way too much everclear in them but we like them"" margaritas.  There is a known rule amungst my friends and I wish to share this with anyone who reads this...if you ever go to Baby A's for happy hour and you have 2 purples, go home or stop drinking!!!! We did neither.    You see, we had an urge...Lava Lounge is one of our favorite bars downtown for two reasons, 1) it's located on 7th street around the corner from Fuel so it's nice to get away from the 6th street crowd! (For those of you that are not familiar with Austin, TX, sixth street is a popular strip that has about 60 bars adjacent to each other.) The music at Lava Lounge is formatted to fit everyones liking.  If you don't like the song on now, the next one will make you happy. 2) Lava Lounge is the home for our Bartender of the Month 3 months in a row! (Bartnder of the Month is voted on by our users)Walk up to the bar and ask for Gary, tell him you want the Marcus and Jack shot! Red Bull/Jager shots will come your way! Enjoy...oh yeah...tell him that ATXNIGHTLIFE.COM sent you!  We did make our way down to the Dizzy Rooster where it just so happend that Dax from MTV's Punk'd was at the bar.  We talked to him for a bit, and he said that he was in town filming a movie with Greg Kinnear (I think that's how you spell his last name).  It's funny how when you see someone on TV you have a certain idea of that person, but once you meet them, they aren't exactly what you imagined.  I pictured Dax as the party guy that goes out and drinks the night away.   Party Guy: yes Drinker: no But we had fun anyway! He was a pretty cool kat and the ladies sure loved him.    When we finished our sixth street bar hop, we ended it right where we started...Lava Lounge.  *From here on out, this is here-say: we walked into the bar and the place was packed!  We walked up to the bar 5 minutes past ""1st last call"" and Gary started making us shots.  The night couldn't have been better, good times with good friends, and one hell of a cheap tab!  Oh...I forgot to mention one thing...I met a midget who was an ex-pornstar! (or so he claimed...didn't matter cause he was surrounded by a crowd of girls, so we talked to him.)  God love the nightlife!!!"
ndf,"HEY WHATSUP...i doubt anyone will ever ever read this...least on a regular basis...but who does? ya i just needed a place to put everything down on paper...or w/e this stuff is made out of... and also i made this for all those boring days in the summer where this just might cross your mind and then u can read it...so if u read it then awesome, this is just mostly me talking to whoever wants to hear aight...aight......so ya comment if u have any other enlightening comments u wanna make or if u just wanna make fun of me...Thanks...i appreciate it...o YA Jenilee thanks with the hard thought naming process...        So i guess ill start this whole thing by telling a funny story...ya it happened i guess 3 days ago and anyways i was at this grad. party @ the duffies and well it was pouring down rain of course and everyone and their cat was there. So i had to go and park half a mile down the road  and run to their house in the flood...and ya i know im dumb but i wore those really cheap old navy sandals and well lemme tell ya... you cant run in themm...especailly if theyre wet...ya basically im saying that i fell on the way there but i eventually got there and it was packed out... but the food was good and the people were cool so i had fun for the most part until i discovered the chips and hot sauce...IT WAS SOOO good...i loved it..it just set ur mouth on FIYYYAA  but not too much and ya it was goodddd. So you would probably think thats a good thing but i was chilln upSTAIRS and so i'd have to go up n down em to get more...well so i run outta chips and so i get up to go down for more and im headin down the stairs and i catch glance of this amazingly hott girl(not sayin who) and well i guess i lost focus for a second cuz my hand with the plate of hot sauce hit the side rail and i missd a step and ya the plate toppled all over the white carpeted stairs... and all over mrs. stark who was sitting on them for some reason?? so ya it was embarrasing...especially asking mrs duffie for something to clean it up with... mrs stark wasnt mad..PHEW and it ended up bein alrite besides the embarrassment...so basically the moral of the story is Never NEVER eat the hot sauce at those so called ""GRAD PARTIES"". just don't...its not worth the risk...the RUSH is only for a second...but the consequences they never go away...so DONT...Do...GRAD Hot SAuce...       THE MORE YOU KNOW..."

ndf,"they say the best things in life are free.  i am inclined to believe whoever ""they"" are, though it's more like i NEED to believe them.  i'm starting this blob as a means to chronicle my struggle with the green, i.e. marijuana, and to begin putting words and images to this struggle--and maybe find some like-minded folks out there who too find themselves slogging through life, highly functioning, gainfully employed, well liked and quite intelligent but with an insatiable love for pot.  it's a complicted process, to be sure. my relationship with this drug is the longest relationship i've had--just about 15 years now--and it's waxed and waned in it's intensity but it's always been there when i needed it, keeping me as distant and untouchable as i wanted or needed it too.  i've used it the way some use alcohol--as a means to loosen me up in crowds, or make life just that much more interesting.  i've used it to wake me up, to clean my house, to grocery shop, to plant a garden, walk the dog, surf the 'net, drive long distances.  what does a pot smoker look like?  there is no one face.  i am not a deadhead, i am not a fan of jam bands in particular, i have a master's degree in creative writing, i have held a directorship for five years, a committed relationship for seven, i am published, own my own home, my truck, my life. or maybe the latter is not correct. my life is owned by something else, and it's kind and green and comes in so many different and amazing strains.  how did i get here? is it worth the struggle to get out?  if i wasn't such a comparative (as in i am constantly comparing myself to others, holding up the mirror, measuring the lack) junkie, i wouldn't flail so much in the face of quitting, because i know so many others who seem to get along just fine with this particular substance, using it recreationally and not worrying about it.  i get angry.  nobody likes the word addict. it seems so mealy and ugly.  what does an addict look like?  does s/he look like me? would knowing make any difference? i know you're out there.  i know you hear me, you of the family of the green."

And to top it all off, my period is due tomorrow which cuts my tolerance in half.  I have been so exhausted the last couple of days, I'm not sure if there is something going around or if it just the 10 years of interupted sleep that is finally catching up with me.  I have no energy and all I want to do is eat.  I need to get out and do something.  Still mulling over the idea of a move to AL.  Sometimes the thought of starting over in a new place is very refreshing and at other times, terrifying.  Truth is though, I probably don't have the drive to move this whole family.  And I know that B is pretty happy right where we are, if he got a little better job we would probably be very comfortable, and wouldn't even be considering a move.  I've done so much work with tweaking his resume and getting it out there that every time he has an interview and it doesn't work out, it almost feels like a rejection of me.  Stupid I know, and he totally takes it in stride, but I am starting to get frustrated that people don't see his potential and qualifications.  Well, I should really get busy and get something done today, there is a ton of laundry to put away and maybe I'll bake something.  It is a gorgeous day out and not too hot yet, so it is great weather for baking."
ndf,Speech Communication  is a  GE  course of mine..and one of my favored subjects as well as hated..  I love it because of our  teacher..Mr. Elmer Rufo..a gay..and a funny man..I mean..woman..as he would like to be. He's directing a play called Antigone. Never heard of it's story but we are obliged to watch it..since it's essential part is a review of the play..nice prof..  I hate it on the other hand..because...of my classmates. They're kind of different from the other classmates I have in other subjects. It seems very hard to go and have a bond with them. They seem the hard type of people to get along with. But hey...there's nothing I can do anyway..so I'll just live it like that..

No, we don't get paid for it (we damn well should!) and there's no equipment to use or an office or shop to go to, but taking care of children is definitely a large responsibility! Especially if you choose to exclusively breastfeed...for 10 months...  Does ""he"" respect me as a mother, as a person he is involved with, and as a woman?!? At this moment, on this day, I truly question if the answer is yes..."

ndf,"Ok, so it's like 4 in the morning and I've laid in bed for 2 hours trying to go to sleep and it's just not working.  I decided to cruise some blogs and then thought oh yeah, I have that one I should work on. I've been thinking way too much tonight, probably why I can't sleep. Anyway to the point, reading blogs I began to think man there are some really damaged people out there. I wonder am I one of them..........do you ever realize, come to an ephipany, hey I'm a really screwed up person........or do you just think everyone else is and you're normal?"
ndf,"i believe that there are some things in our better half that only us can see. No matter how people insists that they know the person inside out, i'll shot my ten cents to prove them that they are wrong.  this is such a sleepy saturday. i woke up so early and i have to be in the office by 10am. it's ninoy aquino's day... definitely, a double-pay holiday =) it's my kuya ed's birthday. but none of those made this day a special one for me. i've been so screwed for the past few weeks. bad break-up, scary starting overs, the betrayal of friends.. whew! but those were swept away by this happiness im feeling right now. what feeling can overcome the joys of being in love? yeah, same old, same old... just an ordinary story... for YOU! but this is a whole new feeling for me.  i fell in love with this person wherein from the start, all eyebrows are raising, all rumors are spreading, all comments and objections are flying in the air. i'm scared. but what the heck! knowing myself, i love making my life fussy. im interested with risks. and god! I AM IN LOVE! that's the most important reason, isn't it? and so the story goes...  along the way of our relationship, all the negative notes i heard from my friends about my partner that made me real scared are all appeared to be the opposite. things i heard are way far different from what i've seen. and what do you expect from people around you? again, the raising of eyebrows...and worse, they betrayed me when i least expect it. at first, it really hurts... but now, who cares?! anyway my other friend told me that i should trust my instincts.  today, i woke up early with a big smile on my face. knowing that this person proved that even the most devil creature has good sides too =) but oh.. im not saying that my partner is such a demon. hahaha dont get me wrong. i love her for who she is. im happy... very happy..."

ndf,"I've heard about blogs quite a bit and finally decided to test the waters of putting one together.  I'll be curious to see if this changes my life any.  I'm sitting in my recently-painted TV room watching some show about ancient man-made things found off the island of Malta.  It's typical Science Channel stuff.  I love anything like that.  I'm also sitting in various chat rooms right now, but not really monitoring what is going on in them.  But if someone wants to chat me, that's cool.  I'll chat back -- maybe.  The TV room is now Ruby Red.  Or as a friend of mine called it -- ""Ho Red"".  It was a bitch to paint.  But I did it all myself.  It took one coat of primer and 4 coats of the red.  There is still minor color differentiation, but you can't really see it that much.  I'm probaby the only one that would notice them."

ndf,"I'm getting so frustrated with my dad. He's making me so mad. I sat up last night till about 1:00 because I was so mad. Well, our house is for sale. I guess they still want to think that I'm moving too. My parents are trying to make me feel bad for breaking the ""family"" up. Family my a$$. Yesterday I went to my moms house and played some music. There were so many people there. we had about 5 or 6 guitar players, 3 or 4 bass players, and 2 or 3 drummers. We think we may have a band formed though. Me, a guy named Matt who plays guitar, his brother who will play either bass or guitar, and Dean who will play whichever intrument Matt's brother doesn't play. Dean is awesome. He went to Juliard for four years playing bass but if you give him a flute, he would probly know how to play it. It's early and I need to go to band practice soon so I better stop writting."

ndf,"I saw Leif yesterday.  For those of you who don't know he used to be my old roommate and a good friend of mine until he tried to rip me off anyway he could with rent and bills.  He also lied to me every opportunity he got, and then he had the audacity to tell Ryan that I lie all the time about everything.  I really could care less if I ever see him again.        Anyway, I was walking through the mall with Ryan and her mom yesterday and he and his daughter were looking at purses.  I saw him and I tried to get away from him without him noticing me.  It didn't work.  ""Yeah, that's right, Adam.  You just keep on walking,"" he said.  ""Okay,"" I responded and I kept on walking.  He responded with, ""Shmuck!""  And then he saw Ryan and said, ""Hey, baby.  How are you?""  I guess he still likes her.  I have no idea.  I really hope that's the last time I see him but I doubt it is.  A few weeks ago Ryan and I were driving back to her house and when we got to her street he was driving past us.  We turned around to see if that was him, and he turned around and drove past us again.  We turned down another street to get back to her house.  He passed us again.  Each time he covered his face, and Jennifer (another former roommate of ours who is now dating Leif) covered her face so I guess we wouldn't recognize her.  We never saw him again that day, but is he stalking me now?  Was he just bored so he got his two kids and girlfriend in the car and set out to find me?  Will I ever be rid of this guy?    Last night, I got home and Belinda (my roommate for another month) was in the kitchen.  She was leaving to go stay at a friend's house for the night, but before she left she told me that my room smelled bad.  She blamed it on my shoes or trash in my trash can.  She told me I needed to get some candles or an air freshener.  This caused a fight.  It was our first fight since moving into the place last August.  The only thing that I smell in my room is the air freshener that she put into my room a month ago that smells horrible.  My shoes are brand new and therefore do not stink.  The only trash I have in my room is paper.  My room is the only room in the house that actually smells good.  The rest of the house smells like her sausage and Slim Jims.  Anyway, I cleaned my room last night and hopefully she'll be happy now.  I only have three more weeks left in this place and after that I won't have to deal with this anymore."

But I'm hoping that we get this block party going thats going to happend in a few weeks, well actually next month probably, but i really want this party to happend b/c I'm gonna be turning 16 soon and want to have a tight party lol!! Well my mom called radio stations to help us with the party and everything and hoping that goes well too. It would have been a lot cooler if i got my licenses on my b-day too, if only i had a car though, hehe. I would go on a small road trip with my friends and not come back untill 2 weeks later (yea right my parents would kill me). Anyway, hope that everyone has a tight Fourth Of July, peace out!"

But the ad agency where I work (www.adbiz.com) suddenly has more work coming in, and I've got two new projects on the go for freelance this week. One is search engine writing for a cosmetic surgeon's website. Another, an ad for building insurance. A lot more like this, and I'll be back in France in no time.  I've started on a couple more articles, about onsens and enkais in Japan and the glories of NS in the summer. But I have yet to finish one, since the paid stuff is taking up my time. That, and badminton! We started a club here in Gainesville, and we played for the first time two nights ago. It was fun. Some competitive people there, but for the most part, we just blissed out getting all sweaty (no a/c) and hitting the bird around.  Although it threw me for a loop when my French friend went to kiss me on the cheek instead of shaking hands after our first game. I got a little shy and forgot to do the second cheek. So we just resorted to the regular hand-shaking after that."

ndf,"France and the Allies celebrated last week end one of the most fantastic military operations ever made in the world. Never so much depended on so few courageous soldiers wo sacrified to free a continent they didn't know. I'm 26 and i knom i'm living in a free land thanks to brave young men who fought for what they believe to be right. I will always love this America but i can help thinking that today America is on the wrong way. America's grief is justified, America is right to launch attacks against a faceless ennemy who wants to burn the whole world but this fight can be boiled down to a fight between evil and good, to a crusade against barbarians, it will be dangerous and counterproductive. Europe knows how complex is the world, europe knows how high is the price of blood and Europe doesn't want to be part of the wrong war. The United States are our closest friends and friends don't have to agree on everything. On the contrary, i will be happy if my friends tell me that i'm about to make a huge mistakes, that i act like a fool. I will be very thankful and i will accept this lend hand... because i don't want to stumble and fall in the Depths"

Oh well, everyone comes on Sunday anyway. ---------------------------------- I also took an IQ test about 10 minutes ago, and it said my IQ is 133. I think that's pretty good, I'm not sure exactly.

I dunno that jes pisses me off he has no right to ask for any kind of compensation after that. He took the money out of me in physical pain as well as hospital bills and the pure fact that he could be owing me money a whole lot quicker with one call to the cops. Dennis sit back, realize how cool about this I've been and give me a motherfucking break. Im still paying goddamn court fees from before and I dont have a fucking job so just accept me being cool and what you did payment enough. Whatever s'bullshit.

You're afraid to tell people this, but sooner or later it gets out in a bad way, and you think you screwed up everything. And when you are in love is when you are sad the most.     urlLink   What Emotion Dominates you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    she came over today. i realized i missed spending afternoons with her. i guess its because i lost her for a while. maybe i needed that.  i have a motto:  paranoid bitches should go to hell.  because when you are, too many things go on in your mind. unnecessary stuff.   i am one of those bitches. ive been ignored. im being paranoid about it. its time to go to hell."

He only got down to the last string before he stopped and it was still alive and cleaning it's self like a cat. I was pretty disturbed by this so I begged him to finish the job and just put it out of it's misery. I know this one is in connection to the recent beheadings in the middle east."

I was like tired, because I had like stayed up till 3 am trying to fix my damn ghetto computer. I made something for them to eat, but one of them didn't want to eat. I got so pissed and I made her eat. She ate it and everything went fine. Then I decided to fix my computer and I tried installing another version of XP on it. It almost broke down. I was so totally freaked out! I mean god damn! Then Thomas had to call and I had to go over to Sloan's house cause he just got a multi tap. (like I cared if i he just got one!). Well I went anywayz and had a really lame time. I am not really good at video games, I mean fighting games. We then played an NBA game and I totally sucked at it. I suck at the real thing, what makes them think that I could play a fake version? When I got home, my computer was fixed and I was happy. But then I had to defrag it and I was pissed. Then I went to the upstairs computer and I started to type in my blog! I had to fix the internet connection first. While typing this, the TV said that Linkin Park has a new video coming out and it is one of my favorite songs. ""breaking the habit"" and there is a making the video at 6 pm tomorrow (i think) and I am totally psyched that they have a new video! So now i feel bored.  OMG it is a linkin park video and i am totally wanting to watch it, damn, my mom turnt it away! DARN!! Well, i dont like that vid much anyways. I have to defrag this computer now, S'later pplz!"
ndf,"Isn't it strange how well life is going perfect yuo never take time to thank God for everything that you have, but then the second you lose something you either blame it on God or beg him to give it back, or when you do have something you want u go to God and ask him to do it all for you. Isn't it strange how when u have alot of friends to talk to you dont care about the people who mean most to you, but then when you lose all your friends you try and turn back to the ones who care about you even though you ignored them and treated them like jerks. Isn't it strange that the things you seem to hate most in life are the things that will help your life, like doing math homework, or getting grounded for failing a science test that u didnt study for to begin with. Isn't it strange how sometimes your worst enemie becomes your best friend, and your best friends sometimes become your enemies. Isn't it strange how when someones so happy with the thing they have you start to get jealous insted of being happy for them, then start to want something just because someone else has it. Isn't this just all so strange?"

ndf,"Hi, I'm Tash and this is my random blog which I created for two reasons. One is because I was bored, two because I wanted a gmail account and three because I decided the world needed to hear the random Ponderings of a Nutcase. So thats me. The nutcase. I live in New Zealand in a house with a cat and a dog. And I like to be random. And my pet peeves are French keyboards, the sounds MSN makes and jingle singers. I mean who really puts on their CV, 'Ah yes, that's me. I sang in the Felix Catfood jingle.' ??? Also, I don't like Bush. At all. And I don't like Micheal Jackson because he has a dead nose and sings like a sick hippo. There are lots of things I do like though. I like melted mozerella, the number 666 - just a random thought but if there is an apocolypse, wouldn't it happen on 06/06/06? Just a random vibe - and I like redheads. I love shopping. Shoe shopping. But I hate French keyboards and porridge. I think that is enough randomness for now. More later. Tash P.S. If anyone has a gmail account they don't want well... lets just say I know a taker..."

I really don't want to say anything seeing as to how I've cost them over 14 thousand dollars in the past 5 weeks.  I figure that cutting the grass is the LEAST and is the very MOST I will do to make it up to them (yeah right).  How much money have you guys cost your parents?  I bet I beat you!  I really need to stop joking about this...it's starting to sound like I don't care, and I really really do.  I feel like shit.  I barely ate anything yesterday.  I had a footlong sub from Subway and some watermelon.  That watermelon was awesome.  I'm really ready for school to start back because I found out that if I don't have anything to occupy myself, I tend to bring on a lot of trouble."
ndf,"Started Drivers Ed. again today. I would of already had my permit if I had not gone on vacation to Florida when I was taking the class for school in Feb. but I have to admit, the trip was worth it. On the bright side, I only have to go for 15 more days. July 1st I should have my permit if all goes well. When I got home, sense I'm now offically on summer vacation, I did what I've been wanting to do for a long time, absolutly nothing. I just sat around watching T.V. (of course nothing good was on -_-) but it was a good day. Other than that, I didn't do anything today. Planning to go to my friend Micheal's house tomorrow but he might already have plans, we'll see what happens."
ndf,"why the hell can't I get a damn doctor or dentist appointment withing this century.  Is there this much of a shortage of doctors.  I have serious problems here (but not enough of an emergency to call an ambulance) and nobody can see me because they are all booked till november or some crap.    Now that I got that out... first entry in this log just so happened to be after calling multiple doctors and dentists to find that we seem to have a shortage of them.  Well, I gotta get back to work now... setting up this blog was my waiting on hold task... time for some real work."

ndf,"im kind of new to this blogging thing so what im gonna probabally do is explain what i do on a day o day basis. before i go on i do gotta tell you that i am in high school and may not spell things correctley or use proper english and sometimes thethings i may tell you about may sound kind of childish but the people i hang out with are open like this.  to start ou i wanna tell u  about this girl i like, im not gonna tell u her name but lets call her ms.n, about all year i have been seeing her in the hall but couldnt like ask her out or anything cuz i was with someone, so when i finally broke up with her i was like, hey now i can talk to her, so u know i started by saying wazzup or how are u doing. im kind of a shy guy and dont really talk to that many girls, not that im gay or n e thing, but im shy, so i told a couple of my friends and they like the loosers they are went and told her before i could, not that i was in a rush to tell her and all but they were like she was like she was flattered and all but that was it.  so my friend was like go up to her and talk to her so i was like ok i got it all planned out im a go up to her and be like ""wazzup u know i like u and all cuz i know all these people been tellin you and i wanted to know if i could get your numer and mabey i could call u some times"" so i had practiced it in front of the mirror and had it down pat and ready to do it.  so i went up to her and did it and do u beleive that she said no , well not so brief and short and blunt, but she was like, i dont really give my number out to that many people, so i was like thats cool so i left it at that."
ndf,"everytime i have a crush, i'm always hoping for something that might not come true. i always end up daydreaming about him, i can't concentrate on the things i'm doing. sometimes, i convience myself that the guy i like might like somebody else, but i still like him.  maybe the word  martyr  is next to my name. i'm always waiting for the right guy but i always falling with the wrong guy. a friend e-mailed me about what those the selection their mean, the question # 8 asked to choose a # between 1-10..i choose 8..and it says thare that's the number i will fall in love before i get married..that's so weird. ok, i admit it..i easily fall in love with a guy that is really sweet,nice, good-looking and accepts me for who i am.. gtg..i've got some work to do.."

ndf,"You wanna know why this girl looks how she looks?  Well this poor little girl was forced by me to talk with me  for more than an hour.  Hmm you wonder why I did this?  Well lets start with the background  Since Simon (a class mate of mine) invited us to a grill party, this became a tradition. The photo was taken at such a party and me being very drunk started  to talk to every girl telling her such great things like  ""You're the horniest in our gradates!"" or ""You can run but I'll  always find you""  Well for this not being embarassing enough I looked for a victim I can talk to for longer time, well there she was!  This time I was in love with a chubby cheeked girl named Karen. Luckily my ""conversation partner"" was the best friend of her. So the conversation was only about how Karen and I match together.  You can imagine that me being very drunk said things, which I had better not said.  Finally I can only say that I don't remember all the stuff I told her, but my opinion about relationships and what is important in such relationships were the best things I told her, because now everybody knows what a horny  guy I am with my 17 years.  Well this evening seemed to be a turning point of my imagination for a  relationship with Karen, because later she wanted to clear some things, between me and her. This resulted in a telephone conversation for about nearly two hours. The only thing I can conclude from this session is that she is an ecological cunt, who thinks that she is something better than others.  One reason, which lets me conclude so is that a friend of her told me that Good-naturedness was the only reason why she talked to me.  Well I didn't knew that every person, who talks to me is just good natured. I don't think that conversation is a thing of Good-naturedness, because if so the world will get egoistically and it will become a privilege to talk to someone else.  Sorry but here it seems that sombebody stayed too long in the broad sunlight. Maybe she planted too many patches, which is what she does right at the moment :D  This is it for now, I hope you enjoyed reading this and I hope I could give you a small view of my life.  Greetz"

I suppose its alright...quite professional looking. I applaud whoever makes these. But my new one will be the shit.   Anyway, I was having a good day today until 3rd period and I had english. We're supposed to be a democracy right? That is the whole point of our country, the American Dream. Well, why is school have such a FASCIST system? They tell us what we have to learn and force us to learn in no matter what. If we dont we are threatened with referrals for insubordination or possibly even suspended. What the fuck is this. I hate public school, alot of teachers just dont care about their students. I know if you're a public school kid you just cant possible fathom how much better a private school like Gilman is and I'm sorry if I offend you. I think Ill stop now...please feel free to leave comments. I'll read them."
ndf,"Well, sorry for not posting. Instead of telling about myself, I'll just update my profile. Learn about me there. --- Pretty uneventful week, except for yesterday. I got a haircut and saw Spider-Man 2. THAT MOVIE IS FREAKING AWESOME!!! If I had the time, I would have seen it again. But I am moving in about 2 weeks and I have tons of stuff to pack still. That and I am broke. I am owed $140 and have not gotten it yet. I thought I would have gotten it sooner so I spent all my money and now I have about $2 on me. Oh well, I might get the money this weekend. We shall see.   That's pretty much it for now. I will post again when it is convenient."

ndf,"now im different! i mean, im not one of those ""xanga"" people...i dont dislike xanga, but i just dont like it...im not sure why, but probably cos all my friends have a blog from xanga. and i think its kind of weird... sorry if you are using xanga, dude  well well well, i hope cc (my gooody friend) is doing a good job. Kelpie (another nicccce friend) is leaving soon and there is gonna be a good bye party for her, which is supposed to be a big surprise...but cc already told me that things went wrong from the start...well, good luck guys! im here in japan, and im nothing to do with the party...lol (well i am, cos i was part of the planning, but i cant go anyways)  aww i miss my cat...hes so cute, so cute, and so cute. i can eat him. i mean i cant but i want...no, i dont want to, but if i try i can. sorry i dont make sence. but thats how awfully cute he is...  noow i have to spend my money....for kelpie :) since i cant come to the party, im gonna buy lots of nice things, may be lots of CHEAP things so i can buy even more, and give them to her when im back in europe. but the problem is that im not really allowed to go out alone...and my bike doesnt come off the stupid chain...so its not really possible to go in town and spend the nice money...  -------------i think its enough. so. okay. bye bye"
ndf,"Yea, silence is the key. I try only to speak about job stuff. The rest of the time, may the silence rule the place. Why? Because I'm trying to forget her and the first step to forget a girl u have to see everyday is ignoring her. So I hardly say a word."

ndf,so my friend debbie does this and I thought that it could be good for me. Sometimes I feel like I have to be a certain way for certain people and I thinkt that I need some place that I can just be myself. With no one judging or telling me what to say or what not to say. Today the 3 year old was really cranky and all I wanted to do was go back to bed. It drives me nuts when the parents are here and just don't do anything. I mean what is the point? well I am going to go get some stuff ready.. yea later
ndf,"Yesterday while shooping for my husband, i am usually very nice and polite and try to use as much German as possible. But I always don't have the write words or i just don't know the language that well to come up with a solution to my conversation. Anyway I went to this store here called,""Budnikowsky"". It is smaller to our Rite Aides or Drug stores in the States. The only difference is they don't carry drugs. On the Apotheke pharmacys carry any such over the counter remedy's. My daughter had dropped her binki or pacifier while we were walking and so i had to get a replacement for her and the best to go for that was Budni. Kowing that they carried such items. After getting my stroller in the store and wading threw all the people i had found what i was looking for. I then heading for the line to check out. Since the store is crowed most of the time,even on Mondays, I had to push my way to get in line or other people would just get in front of you again with the no personal boudries issue. If you leave room for another person someone will think that it is meant for them and just cut in front of you no second thought. Well as i approached the counter of this young cashier, she of course never sported a smile to customers but instead basically looked up briefly and gave the look of NEXT! My turn! I said Hi! and she said Guten Tag, meaning Hello back. My total was 1,98 euros. I gave her 2. She then in turn was asking if i had any change but because I dont speak the language i didnt understand what she was saying to me. What kinda of change would she need for 1,98? Two was good enough. All she had to do was give me back two cents. But because i didnt understand what she was saying i did understand her body language which ended up in a huff and a puff from her. Like she was telling me you stupid idiot dont you understand and if you dont you dont belong in my line. Well of course after that gester and after dealing with my sick daughter all day shopping i had all I could take of the day and promptly recieved my change and replied to her, ""You know yo can eat shit!!"". From the look on her face i can tell she understood everything i said even in english. After that i felt great for the rest of the day. I find if you are nice to these workers they run all over you until you are nasty like them back and then they are your best friend.  Viki C."
ndf,"car shopping today went well. i'm really looking at two cars, the nissan spectra and the a saturn coupe. both have the basics that i want, sporty look, power everything, sunroof, standard transmission etc. the spectra has got more balls than the saturn but i think i'll get a better deal with the saturn. this is my first experiance buying a NEW car. soo many choices, i feel like a kid in a candy store..hehe  still no real resolution on the female issue. seems as though it get more complicated whichever way i go, so i think my plan is going to be to just ride out the storm and hope for a better days in the future. i know i know not a very creative solution but i honestly can't think of anything else.  on a different note i was thinking about the relationship my generation has with their work. my parents worked three jobs when they were younger and to this day i haven't know them to complain about it. they saw it as a chance to make money and as simply doing what you needed to do. it's strange that just one generation later we see people who can barely handle working one fulltime job and endlessly complain about how much they do. i really believe if we worked harder as a generation we would not only do better personally but do more for each other. not to get too religious but catholics believe that forgiveness/redemption is not based on faith alone but also on good deeds. maybe if we did more for each other on a regular basis we would all be better off, then again that's just my opinion..."

I helped him cos I felt that he was true to mi and was a worthy  friend  to help but that was only a point of view of mi of a guy so i'm not sure about others (mostly the gals), I also donnoe about his past about his relationships wif other galfriends so I did't made much comments about him on tat.

ndf,"Last Sunday I completed my first long run, 5 miles. Not bad. I followed the suggested training regimen this week, even the Friday cross-training session. My packet of training info suggested that “pool running” was, “…hands down the best cross-training activity for runners…”. I decided since I bought a swimsuit last fall, I would put it to good use at Yale's Olympic-sized pool.   The only person in the area who didn't think I was a complete idiot was the undergraduate student lifeguard, whom I informed of my intent to “pool run”. He was a member of the Yale swim team, and, “very familiar with pool running.” He proceeded to describe types of pool running exercises, and while trying to explain one in particular, asked me if I was familiar with water polo. I replied, “No, but I know how to play Marco Polo.” Unfortunately, my childhood days of Marco Polo training proved insufficient…   Referring to pool running, the article states that, “… it looks a little odd.” Well, they were right. All 15 or so people at the pool, including the children trying to play around in the lane next to me, thought I was a complete whack-job. To give you a better idea of what pool running looks like, think of a common dream you might have had or heard of - you know, the one where someone is chasing you and you're running but not going anywhere? It's like that, but add to your mental picture: 8 lanes of professional swimmers, 1 lane of 3 kids trying not to stare, a swim cap, goggles, and Melissa Bourgeois trying to “run” to the other end of the pool without drowning. That's pool running.   Although I looked like a total ass in the pool, I felt great afterwards, much unlike I feel today. It seems I have either mild food poisoning or a stomach virus – either way, I can't even think of food without wanting to vomit. Suffice it to say I will not make my 6 mile long run today, which I am very disappointed about. It's only going to make my 7 miler next week that much harder. I'm trying to get as much rest as possible today so I can try to make up the long run tomorrow. We'll see. Right now I'm going to head for the couch and a little comedy central…"
ndf,"so i'm back from my family vacation and it was alright...i guess the best thing about the whole trip was actually seeing my entire immediate family (divorced parents, my sister and her 2 children, my son and myself) together...family is a blessing and i'm grateful for it...i did get a chance to spend some time on the beach by myself...i'm glad that i called my main home girl who advised me to claim what i needed and that was some time without my son...being on the beach and standing in front of water and talking to god was very refreshing...i asked god to give me clarity with my relationship with ""him""  then things got interesting...i got an phone call from ""keys"" and he expressed to me that it would have been nice if i came to visit him and asked how i would have responded to advances he may have made...after all this time, i really do honor our friendship and would not want to cross any lines that cannot be reversed...plus, i must honor what ""he"" and i are experiencing now and must give the respect that i ask of him...right?"

I'm not in the mood to dwell on serious topics like this right now..so i'll be moving on to something a bit happier.  I'm going to a cottage tomorrow with a whole bunch of my friends. Its in Grand Bend, right on the main strip. I hope its fun. It will be...we always have fun together. I dunno though, for some reason im not really looking forward to it. Maybe its because I just started to like this guy Matt, and I dont want to leave and not be able to talk to him. I know its only for a few days, but im in that ""just srarting to like someone"" phase, and i like talking to him as much as possible. Oh well, the week will go by really fast, and Ill be back here, and able to talk to him as much as i want. Well, its been a pretty boring day...not much to talk about.

ndf,"let the anonymity begin.  i think we all have something we want to talk about, but that we can't quite bring ourselves to reveal to anyone we actually have to see face to face. i have an overwhelming feeling (regardless of its veracity) that no one will quite understand what i'm saying. but if you do, please share any insights you have with me. my views are not extreme or disturbing, just a challenge for me.  let's start with the introductions. i'm a 27-year old single female. this is NOT a solicitation for men to start asking me out. it's simply a fact. i love being single and being able to do whatever i desire with my life. i've recently returned to grad school and changed my career/life path extraordinarly. i've also moved to a new city where i have made some great friends (mostly male, as is the norm for me). i come from a christian household and still cling to my faith despite doubts and challenges. the big challenge currently is sex.  for better or for worse, i have a sex drive. currently, it's driving me mad. but i also have a moral code that keeps me from even entertaining the idea of casual sex. due to my odd combination of faith and life interests (drinking, smoking, crude jokes, liberal hippie crap, independent lifestyle, tolerance, tattoos, piercings, etc.) it is very difficult to find anyone who is compatable with me. and that's the beginning of the trouble...when i do someone who looks good on paper, i cannot get interested (even though i desparately need to release some pent-up sexual energy). i'm not looking for a solution, per se, but i am frustrated and venting. what am i looking for? HOPE.  so if you got it, send it my way. are you a christian man or woman who has found a great sexual and life partner despite not ""appearing"" to be the christian norm? i often consider giving in to a casual encounter, but i honestly don't think i could physically go through with it...and i'd certainly beat myself up afterward. not out of guilt, necessarily, but just cuz i know that's not what makes me happy.  life is good in so many ways, and hopefully through more of the posts i can open up more of who I am to myself (and to anyone who cares to read them). i am a very odd combination. and i like it :) but i think most people find me very confusing (probably think i'm a prude)...and they like it from about 10 feet away. goodnight moon."
ndf,"It's true, mobile phones are great devices.  I've had one since i was 13, plan of course, not shitty pre paid which Evan always complains about, and, I've always had a regular wage earning job to pay for my phone bill.  But why are phones so great? Because they are becoming more stable, smaller/bigger, better battery life and more reliable.  I change phones every now and again, having had the ever popular Nokia 3310 for 2.5 years, followed by a Sony Ericsson T610 for 8 months, an N-Gage (POS) for a month, a Nokia 7650 for a month (old, but top phone), and currently, have a brand spanking new Sony Ericsson K700 in my possession which I've had for the last week, not even out here yet. Take a look at my precious:  http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_ericsson_k700-692.php  New, small, super tankish battery life, and a whole load of features. And yes, I can control my mobile phone bill, but a phone is essential for me as I need to be picked up from all the places I go, unless otherwise catching public transport.  But, Evan is against the 90% or whatever it is of Australians that own and use a mobile phone."
ndf,"Sorry, I'm trying to figure out how to use this whole blogger thing. Well... if any of you want to see updates of what happens day-to-day then go to my xanga (misleadchild). I need to figure out how this works, when I do I'll post on my xanga that I figured it out.  urlLink"
ndf,"Well, this looks to be my first post on a blog ever...yes...er...have to try this again soon, bye bye."
ndf,This has been a difficult year. Friends have moved away; health has been poor; job satisfaction slim to none. But changes are brewing . . .  I quit my job of three years. I need to move on and give myself time to heal. The transition will be difficult (for me and for the organization) but it's long overdue.  Maybe I need an outlet.  Maybe I need to write.  Maybe I'll do it here.
ndf,"In this process of letting go, I am finding that the most courageous act I can to is to also  let in . Change is the only constant in life, but it never seems to get any easier to move beyond the attachments of my heart and head.   I find that sharing my stories is a part of my process of healing.  It provides release, but also accountability.  In a way, this log is a letter to my future self; a reminder; a chronicalling.    Taylor and I have broken up more times in the past 9 years than I can even begin to count, and in recent years those endings have been becoming more and more final, as we sought other loves and different paths.  But we always seemed to find our way back to each other again.   This time there is a sense of finality.  Despite our best efforts, we just can't seem to move beyond our struggles.  It is heartbreaking to think of leaving behind my best friend and all of the dreams we shared for our future, but it is also exciting to think of the possibilities life has in store for us.    I take solace in the small things...  Puddle jumping on my way to the corner market this morning Birds enjoying all of their new baths after the rains last night Kids in a single file line on their way to a field trip  I am seeking new adventures: meeting new people, exploring new places, new things.... Letting in and  taking in   the world with a new perspective, a lightness, an openess.   The past 3 years have brought a lot of loss and lessons.  I have had to mourn my grandparents for the second time as the dome was sold.  I had to let go of Taylor to be with Mark, who brought a lot of joy, but even more heartache, and then regret that I had hurt Taylor to pursue such a fruitless endeavor.   I have always tried to follow my heart at any given moment, and sometimes the choices that follow are painstakingly difficult.  I can't help but feel that some of those choices have contributed to these insurmountable trials between Taylor and I.  He moved on long ago.    And now I must begin to.    I have learned so much in the last few years; about love and life, and mostly about myself.   I live my life with the faith that everything happens just as it is meant to. I must trust the unfolding, let go, and let in."
ndf,"i've got a lot to do this end of the year, and its not all that fun.  looking forward to having time to play the guitar a lot.  Fix up my blues, get the band working like the complex machine we should be.  I hope we can end up playing the quest.  i am listening to muddy waters.  What a guy.  If being sad is that soulful, i think i'll give it a shot.  This is strange, i feel like the closer i get to summer a certain feeling of nostalgia for the future occurs, even though it hasnt happened yet. sorry if that didnt make sense.      and his count of magical items had diminished by one...

ndf,"Pretty uneventful week, but I am starting my own RPG  using RPG maker 2003. The title is Seal of the  Ancients: A Hero is Born. I am currently working on  the plot and characters and I have a good bit of  graphics for it. I will post news on it as I get more  done on it. I will also include screenshots and parts  of the story. Thats all that really happened. I also  have a lot of energy all of a sudden. I feel like  getting outside and doing all kinds of things. But  it's getting late so I'll do stuff tommorrow. I write  whenever I can/feel like it/have the time."
ndf,"Last week it all came to a head after months of holding it in,  I quit my job and this is what happened:  You know how little things can build up and you hold it inside  until you can't take it any more? Well thats what I did.   I came back last week at the end of the day and Jim started on  me about something that was of no big deal but I blew up and started  yelling at him and him at me and the next thing I know I quit.  I stormed out of the office and went home. It hit me what I had  just done about half way home.  I knew I was wrong in geting mad and quiting but what was done was done. I went home and told my wife and she didn't say a word."
ndf,"Languages are really an amazing thing. They can differ so much, or so little, and they open up so much about the world and culture that speaks them. Languages are so much deeper than many people give them credit for, but they are an essential part of the human experience. If we didn't have language, we wouldn't be human."
ndf,"My Japanese friends just got back from a visit to Toronto. They found the people there much more patient and easy to communicate with than here in Gainesville, FL. And Toronto is probably the most ""Americanized"" city in Canada. Another proof that Canadians are a more considerate breed.   But why is that all Canadians envy you when they find out you're in Florida? Most of them haven't lived here, that's why. Sure, 3x the sunshine is nice. No snow is good, too. But if you ask me, the most important thing about a place is the culture of the people. Eager Canadians who head south for the warm weather will gradually come to realize there's no place like home."
ndf,"It seems to be a very long day today. Feeling sleepy and stuff. :(   Knight Online's gonna start charging really soon. Don't know whether to pay or not to pay. Why do these online games have to charge? Can't they remain free throughout ur entire life? I would seriously love free P2P games.  Samsung phones are really getting the best of me. I seem to be bored of Samsung phones already. I do not know why. They are basically something like Nokia also. Same phone functions, different name only."
ndf,"Ok. Frusterated? Yes. Why? B/c this is like the third time I am trying to post someting on this site.   Blog. So, if you look at dictionary.com, you can see that Websters had already included a defintion for the word blog. I have only recently only heard the word blog. I can't believe it's already in the dictionary. Wonder if it will also be in printed dictionaries, or just an online one.   So, thanks to my ubergeek sis and some other friends who attend nerdrus lawschool, I am now aware of the relatively new phenom of blogging. Courtesy of Mac. I love my mac. Mac is to a PC as a Manolo Blahnik's are to Payless. That's just the way it is.   All right, going to see what happens with the ""blog."" It will turn out one of two ways. Either, I will continue to bore whatever readers somehow happen upon my site. This will be the result of intolerable lectures I will feel better spent in a stream of conciousness. Option 2 -- I get bored of blogging, and forget about it for a while. By the time I think I'd like to give it a go again, I have forgotten my username and password, and am SOL.   Stay tuned to see which way the cookie crumbles."
ndf,"Hey Levi thanks for helping me figure this whole thing out, mad props bud!   This is how I feel You don't know me, so dont talk about me! I know what happened, I was there and you weren't! He is saying that I keep calling and bugging him, but I'm not. You didn't here the things that he said to me and you don't know the way he made me feel. He was my good friend, He could tell me anything, problems with his girlfriend or school, I could also tell him anything, I thought that I could trust him. I was wrong. He told you lies so that way he could be cool and I would be a fool. So this is how I feel. Right now I'm not thinking about what we could have had, Because you are not worth it. Why would I want someone who tells lies? Why would I want someone that can't respect me? You might ask why I am saying all of this if I think your not worth it, But the truth is I don't know either,  I guess that's just how I feel! -Chelsea"
ndf,"Hopefully I don't become obsessed about entering info daily here...truth be told, there is nothing on TV. Saw an interesting personal license plate ""No Klu""...someone obviously not familiar with american culture. Well thats kind of on par with some restaurants in my neighborhood ""The Edibles"" and ""Veg Table"" (more wacky bad english interpretations to come). Ok, now I'm on a roll! Lets get into some little things that piss me off. In L.A. someone decided to memorialize freeways to dead cops and people of inerest. Now, I'm not insensitive to a cop being killed on the job, but do we really have to name a freeway after them? They chose there job, and knew the risk...I'm sorry. I'm sure I will not be allowed to get my street re-named after my dead cat! And the ""Rosa Parks Freeway""? Did I miss her bus ride on the 10 freeway when I was growing up? Now what WOULD be cool...commercial freeways. Taking the Tide freeway east to the Viagra interchange north to connect to the Budweiser freeway east...ahh, home at last."
ndf,"A letter of complain  Dear Ms Tang, I really must have to complain about the summer camp that organized by your company. I was one of the first students from my school to go to this camp. Expecting a relaxing camp, the camp was totally a disaster! There were many problems in the camp, such as there were holes on the tents, all the sport equipment was broken, foods were horrible and a very dirty beach.  On the first night of the camp, it rained. So we decided to stay in the tent to play some card games. However, there were holes on the tents! The rain dropped through the holes and made us all wet. Also, it made us unable to sleep and even so, some of my classmates had caught a cough after that night.  Finally the rain had stopped on the next day, therefore we all got out and wanted to enjoy some sports activities. When we got to the sport equitmenp room, we found that all the things were broken. We couldn't play football because the football had a hole and so do the basketball. We also couldn't play the tennis because we couldn't find the tennis ball. All the things there were like a mass and made the room just like a rubbish room. At that day, we did nothing until noon and all of us were bored.  Hoping for a delicious lunch, the food was awful. The food was badly cooked. For example the fish had bad smell and seemed that it had been cooked a long time ago. The soup was the most horrible dish. The color of the soup was black! We didn't want to eat them, but we were all hungery and there were no restaurants nearby, we had to eat them. In the afternoon, many of us felt sick and had a stomach-ache.   The advertisement of this camp said that there would be a beautiful beach near the camp site for us to swim. However, the beach was terrible too. The beach was full of cans, glass bottles, paper and so do the see. We all disappointed about the camp and we all thought that this was the worst camp that we even had.  I was totally not satisfied by the services that provided by your company and we are claiming the total cost that we spent on the camp which is totally five thousands six hundred dollars. If you don't give us the refund, we will take further action by sending complain to the consumer Council.  I'm looking forward to receiving your prompt reply.  Yours faithfully, K. Ng. K. Ng."
ndf,"Mom has really irritated me all day. She won't stay away from here computer long enough to pet me but 5 or 6 times. She forgot to put ice in my water bowl and then yelled at me when I tried to lick the ice in her cup. She forgot to leave the TV on when she left earlier so I had nothing to watch while she was gone.  And what really got my tail in a knot? Well Mom and Grandma sat here and watched some make fun of cats show right in front of me. As if I wasn't even in the room. I mean geez what do they think, I don't have feelings?  I think I will knead her arm extra hard tonight.  Meow!"
ndf,"Hello and blessed be to all! Well, this is the beginning of my new journal. I had one on AOL, but for personal reasons moved my writings of my escapades to BloggerLand. I've also had numerous physical journals and I've only recently started online journals. As you can see, I love to write. It is one of my greatest passions and sometimes I must write to feel better.  I'm also just as passionate about history, theater, and Paganism. So I guess you could call me a Pagan writer-actor-historian.   Lil' bit bout myself: My name's Brian and I'm 17, living in Hartford, CT. I go to Bulkeley High School and the Academy of the Arts, and I'm overall happy with that. I'm a senior now, and life doesn't seem any different. I guess it's because of my up bringing that I feel like that. You see, I live with my mother, stepfather, and three brothers and our family's pretty boring. For all you kids out there with no siblings, I HATE you. You are too lucky. Siblings-especially brothers-can be a pain in the arse. Trust me, I have three of them!!   A couple of things have made my existence a bit more bearable. Firstly, my faith. I am a proud and out-of-the-broom-closet Pagan who loves the Great Mother. I've been Pagan for five years, and my specialty is healing and the Tarot. I have more Pagan books than I don't know who, and for the most part they were worth the money. I'm also blessed with the gift of the arts. I have dabbled in just about all the arts: painting, photography, songwriting, puppetry, but my two favorites are theater and writing. Though I don't want to be a professional actor, I still at least want to be an  amateur  actor; amateurism deserves more dedication than a hobby, but not as much as a profession.  I just love the theater, but being a professional actor is too harsh a life for me. I want to be a history professor. It isn't as exciting as being an actor, but I love it nonetheless. It is also a very flexible career, and it'll allow me to write--my other passion.     I hope to one day be a published author, but right now I'm just writing. I usually never finish a story or elaborate an idea, but at least I'm writing it down. Eh? I write all kinds of shtuff, but short stories are my speciality. As I continue to write in my journal, I'll slip in a piece or two to entertain any and all.    Well, that's enough writing for now. Enjoy my escapades!!"

ndf,"Ok, so summer school officialy sucks. My sanity is seriously dwindling with each day. At the same time, I'm not so sure that I'm ready to leave college behind. Not a good situation to be in. Go Pistons!"
ndf,"So, it is Friday. I am at work hoping that I am successfully pretending to be working. I do hope it works. My current job is easy to spot. Just go to  urlLink Pravda.sk  and a lot of what you see is a result of my clicking and typing. Yes, you've guessed it right. I am an online journalist surfing the news agencies for the fresh news that I may together with my co-workers offer to the hungry Slovak online audience.   Today is one especially dull day as Fridays often are. So I watch the bubbles bubbling in my mineral water bottle on my desk. It is quite relaxing, but it makes me want to pee too often. That is the price you pay.  Fridays are often filled with expectations of the coming weekend, but not today. See the rason:  The forecast forecasts forbiddingly nasty stormy rainy ugly weather.   That would not worry me too much, but it has been so nice and hot during the working days when I just had to sit here and satisfy the hunger for the news of several thousands of people. Oh well, I should better be going... read you later."
ndf,"Through time all the conflict in society essentially boils down to either greed, power,  or a difference in opinions otherwise unresolvable. From the biggest wars to a fight on the playground it's always one of those 3 things. So you might be wondering what the hell that has to do with anything. My point out of that is that conflict is inevitable and necessary. I can't stand people who think everyone should just tolerate everything even if it conflicts with their own personal views. That's like telling me I should hold out my hands and let someone take a shit on them and like it. Do you have to agree with me, Hell No! Do I have to agree with you, Hell No! What if we just can't come to an agreement............then it's time for a fight! I do have to tell you something.........while you were picking daisys and doing drugs and watching TV.........I was working out, eating right and learning how to fight. So when the shit hits the fan and conflict is inevitable who's side would you rather be on?"
ndf,"Well, apparently, I'm back.       Went to see Grandad in hostpital, he's in the same bit of the same hospital as mum was (cancer wards at Mount Vernon). He seems alright. Yay!       Went to M ;S to get some shopping for Nan. Jenny got 2 hair product things (mousse + spray I believe), so I was allocated £2 by Paul. Now in possession of 2.25 litres of  Blackthorn . Definately got the better deal there, methinks. :D   After, visiting grandad, went to  Wagamama's . Good shit. Noodles and suchlike. Nummyness."
ndf,"There is a group of boys i had always en vious  some of them is in my class. Their releationship had been so close, u can always see them hanging out together during recess, after school anytime. Even if they quarrel they will patch back in a few days and their friendship will still be the same as before or even better. They had the kind of friendship that i always dream of but their friendship is being tested again and i think it is reaili bad this time. I hope here that they will get though this too as it wasn't easy to find friends that thinks alike."
ndf,"Tonight*  I was selfishly ditched for a pack of FM girls. I seriously thought that I had figured out who my true friends are, then I get ditched for someone like her. That's basically insane and it pisses me off a lot. I told Ashley about it and It's not like I can miss the game so I guess I'm going by myself. ::Gasp:: I never go anywhere by myself, so it'll be a learning experience. I got a letter from Eric today. :) The thought of him just makes me smile and giggle. I've been starting to wonder why people are starting crap about us, but then I think i've figured it out. Jealousy. I know Tiffany Engle wanted to jump his bones last week @ volleyball so that's probably where some of the stuff is coming from.   Friday¤  I have to pack for a long essential weekend with the girls. There's a party @ Samanthas then its off to the sleepover routine. I need to take a nap friday because heaven knows I'm always the first one out. Maybe not if I get to talk on the phone with Eric til odd hours of the morning. ::giggle:: So much fun.  Saturday Morning¤  We leave for Celina for a weekend full of 3 girls, a cabin, and probably no electricity. I will cradle my cell phone. I love to camp, don't get me wrong... but boredom kills. We'll be around Celina Saturday night so I was trying to plan something out w/ Angela to go to the bowling alley there or something. Eric said it was pretty cool... and eric knows everything. haha. I was just thinking... Eric hates FM.. and who ditched me today? FM kids.. And ditching Amy.. just IS NOT cool no matter what is going on. So I'll be gone all weekend w/ the girls. I will be home Sunday night probably. Then I have to live through another week till i get to see my baby. later on kids.. ¤Amy"
ndf,"So, I swear I meet someone everyday that is so profound, I dont think that I ever have the thoughts to equate to their greatness. I met this guy once who changed my life in 2 days of subbing for one of my classes. A free-lance actor, better yet, a free-lance thinker. I can see why people say that when you meet the right person you could run away with them and nothing would ever matter.  In the book Catch 22, they talk about running away. And they debate, that running away is bad, because your problems will eventually come back to haunt you, and the conclusion was that he wasnt running away, he was running to his problems, rather making his life more interesting with every second that he spends.  Sometimes, with all of my set ""life-plans"" I want to not forget, that I cant live in--what will happen in the future, but rather in this moment. I never want to be the girl who is uncontent with this moment, because I cant wait for the next moment.  Could that free-lance thinker help me run away. All i know is that, when I want a serious relationship and even think about marriage, I want to meet someone exactly like him. Who I can ""run away"" with, to solve my problems head on, and live in this moment."
ndf,"Wow, only uno more day at school, which is double geography (don't do anything anyway), double english (don't do anything anway), french (I personally don't do anything anyway), RE (don't do anything anyway) and games (meh...softball).   So not really a day at all! Yay!       Intresting incident walking to the stop de bus avec le Sharon - I swung my PE kit at her head. Now if she was normal, it would've flown over her head, and she would've just been scared of being hit in the head. Whereas Sharon, not being normal, held her phone in the way. So it pinged into the road! Ah-hah. Well, it was really funny at the time. Then I bought a lighter, and I made the flame big(ish), only it wouldn't go out, and scared my thumb.       Then saw Will. Exploded the lighter. Saw the retards that work in Budgens. Hehe. It's the law - only retards are allowed to work in Budgens.

ndf,"I was traumatized today.      It was horrible.       Mom let me outside to play. I was having a grand old time. I teased the hamsters in their cage. The little balls of fluff just hate it when I paw the bars. They puff up and jab at me. Little buggers have a heck of a bite when the catch ya though.      When that got boring I spent a little time hunting bugs, though I have be careful to stay away from the rock garden and the flowers that attract the best bugs.      After my belly was full I started my rounds and was on the far side of the house when I was suddenly soaked. Rain came out of nowhere and I just got drenched. I had to sit and cry at the back door screen for five whole minutes before mom let me in so I could dry off in my bed.      I am still a little damp. I am not sure I will recover anytime soon.      I heard mom say that it is supposed to rain all week. I think I will stay inside, no matter how much I crave a good crunchy bug."

A party in Deutsch I and I have to listen to speeches on controversial topics in World Studies, and I suppose I have to write a speech tonight so that I can give it tomorrow. I should get doing the research now, because it'll take awhile, but I have other, more pressing matters, like writing in my blog, vacuuming my room, changing my cat's litter, all that good stuff. And finding my remote. I was watching one of the newschannels, and the news guy was interviewing this woman on the recent phenomenon in America of organization, with shows like Clean Sweep, and stuff, and she was talking about how people spend a certain amount of time everyday looking for something when they could be doing something that they really want to do, and while she was saying that, I was desperately looking for my remote. It was ironic. I still need to find that remote."

ndf,"Paul, Riley and I had a nice weekend. Yesterday we went up to Bellevue to see Corey and Dan's new place. It is a big condo in the Renton Highlands. Her parents were over this way so we all went down to the Bellevue Arts and Crafts fair.   While there I completely mastered the art of breastfeeding Riley while walking with her in the sling. I love it! I don't even think anyone really knew what I was doing. Corey's dad even asked if she was sleeping.  So cool! I do need a new sling though. I think I am going to make one myself.   Today we all went to church. It was our seminarian, Kahn's, last day. So we went downstairs for doughnuts after mass. Then we came home and Riley was asleep so we did some marathon cleaning.   Robbin stopped by to say hi and reminded me of the heart fabric that she made Riley's curtains out of. (she gave me the excess). So I made Riley some cute pants. They are a little big and long now but she has a lot of room to grow into them."

Every time Im around her Its like metting her all over agian, I feel like a little first grader. Is that a good thing?"
ndf,"Stuff goes nuts as soon one gets mad.  As if somehow civility is erased from our brains and mindless matter comes out of our mouths.  Blows thrown at breakable things as if relief of someones frustration is inevitable.  Things twist as a tale changes and turns from moderate to worse.  My wife begged me to let her go her parents house,  while I shaked my head in disapproval.  So I said ""ill make you a deal, I let you go but you clean the house tomorrow.  And get everything ready to go...and I mean everything! including me! get my clothes ready."" As time progressed somehow my wife lost track of time.  Then the time came for me to get ready to go to work.  My stuff wasnt ready as we agreed.  I let my wife know that im about to leave and im not taking her to her moms house.  She gets mad and storms out of the room while screaming  "" I have RIGHTS!!""  me thinking to myself.. ""Fuck man... I have the right to enforce what we had agreed on.""  The arguments got worse as she decided to resolve to threats of what she wasnt gonna do anymore. Of course that incensed me beyond borders of sanity as I thought on my head ""hey its not my fault you took forever in getting ready!!"" We went off to work and she dropped me off.  When the time came for me to come out of work she wasnt outside waiting for me.  I asked around if anybody had a cell phone to call my wife, and apparently nobody did.  So I waited 20 minutes till the next batch of employees came out, and asked them for a cellphone.  My wife answered to my dismay! I asked ""why are you not picking me up!""  She said ""You usually dont come early home so I figured you were gonna take a long time to get out.""  That got me so angry that I almost hit the windshield of my car.  She said ""I have RIGHTS!"" Infuriated as I was I struck the windshield and cracked it."" I was disappointed, but oh well its my wifes fault!!.  Of course I left alot of details out since im so angry right now that its consuming me from within.  It burns me inside as my spirit of goodwill fades into unusefullness.  What a shitty day."

I'm kind of disapointed that Jaclyn was out of town this weekend. We were supposed to go bowling tonight but she had to go to El Dorado. I would have rather gone bowling than to Magic Springs. I think this chick at the church was stalking me. I was walking alone, thinking about stuff, and she saw me and left her friends to walk with me. I had not even met her before tonight but, it turns out she was one of my ex girlfriends best friends sister. How ironic? Oh well, she was pretty cool. Then when we got back to the church we watched t.v. Well, most everybody slept. Jenna tried but I kept her awake, he he he. Jenna and I finally got to talk, I'm glad I got that stuff off my chest. Thanks Jenna. Jaclyn would be proud of me today, I slept from 6:30 this morning to 3:00 this afternoon. I'm still really tired though so I think all I need to say has been said. L8r."
ndf,"I went over to my brother's yesterday evening to give him a demo of Knoppix. It was a CD which I got with my Dutch magazine PC-Active. The version is 3.3 His impression before putting the CD in was that Linux was overall much to difficult to learn, after all, he'd been using Windows since he has a PC - which is a fair few years now. When the KDE desktop appeared with working sound his face simply lit up. He didn't have to say anything, I could hear him think ""wow!"". We had a look through the main menu-structure and just ran a few programs - Mozilla, KMail, KStars, the Control Centre. He was simply impressed. I have to say, even from the CD, Knoppix is fast and reliable. He's now going to play around with the CD for a while and will probably get more enthousiastic as time goes by. In a couple of weeks (days?), I expect a request to make him a permament install on his hard-drive. He had just had a lot of virus-related problems and his windows-box had grind to a halt a couple of days ago. He was very interested in learning that with this operating system, no more of that would happen. He was also worried he wouldn't be able to do the things in Linux he did under Windows, but after showing him OpenOffice.org, this was no longer an issue.  Oh, by the way, there is a new version of Knoppix, 3.4 - read all about it on the  urlLink Knoppix website"

ndf,"I'm just tired of being in this constant state of flux. Nothing is ever enough and nothing is ever right. I want it all and I want it to be better than the last time. I don't really know why I am doing this, but, I suppose I just need to start opening up my life. I need to be ready for the next step, no matter what that is.  I feel so trite.  How did happiness and  enough  ever become a bad thing? When did I become conditioned to want and feel that want become ""need""? Again, it almost hurts that I'm so transparent. Yet, I say nothing. Ironic. I guess that transparent is the wrong word...More like childish, silly and empty. Nothing new to say, nothing new to share, just raw."

ndf,"Cameron woke up at 4:00 a.m. from a strange noise coming from the kitchen. She thought it must have been Mrs. Chives from upstairs doing something. Cameron is a cautious girl, so she got up to check it out, just in case. She grabbed her pepper spray from the drawer of her bedside table and slowly walked towards the kitchen door. She pushed the door half way open, quietly, and stuck her head inside. She looked around the kitchen, but didn't see anything. Being annoyed by the whole ordeal, she dragged herself back to bed. She almost fell asleep again, untill she heard someone humming at the end of the hallway, with a woman's voice. Cameron is also a very down-to-earth girl, so she tried to find a reasonable explenation for it... it's like a reflex. ""Maybe someone is lost or something..."" she said to herself in a trembling voice. The humming sound kept getting louder and more intence, and the room got a bit cold. Her bedroom door was half open, and the only thing that lit up the room a bit was the moonlight, shining through the window. She kept staring at the hallway and breathing heavily, listening to the humming sound. She thought of asking who it is, but she wasn't that bold. Out of the darkness from the hallway, she could see two bright red eyes... she just sat up on her bed and had her eyes wide open. She didn't know what to do, so she panicked. She closed her eyes tight and tried to convince herself that it was just a dream. As soon as she opened them, she saw a shadowy figure standing at the foot of her bed, with the bright red eyes. It whispered something to her, but she couldn't understand it, mostly because she was terrified and extremely anxious. It reached over to Cameron's face, and she could see it's hand in the moonlight, it was as white as snow. Before she could do anything, her window opened and someone jumped inside! The figure with the red eyes turned, facing the other person. It started hissing, and it vanished in thin air. Cameron couldn't believe her eyes!      Who is that someone who saved her?   Did you like my story so far??? If you want to find out who that person is and what that creature was doing there, read my next post!!! ;)"
ndf,"Hello and thank you for taking the time to visit my blog. To begin I am 27 years old (on 8/18/04) am I divorced father of three wonderful children whom I love with all my heart and soul. My oldest son Nick is soon to be 8 and his hobbies include looking for creepy crawlies just like every other boy you may know. Kassandra is the next in line she is daddies princess at 6yrs old she's pretty much like any other little girl bent on making boys fall before her feet while looking sweet and innocent. Then there's Tyler 4 the youngest of the group and the cohort to Nickolas anywhere nick goes so goes Tyler. As for dad well i'm into drawing fantasy art, golf, and reading the Holy Bible as I try to follow gods commands for my life. Now as I said I am a divorcee I have to mention the one woman that has come into my life and helped restore order to an otherwise stressful life Amber my fiancee as of 6/18/04 wedding planned for summer of 05. Amber is the spark in life that has opened my eyes to life after divorce she has brought to me what it's like to be truely happy in an otherwise dark world.I lOVE YOU AMBER AND KIDS"
ndf,"I don't entirely know why I've changed 'blogs'. I used to be at diaryland.com but decided to change, as things are starting afresh.   The summer's here. Gah. Lots of thoughts swirling in my head. Waiting for other friends to officially finish their colleges etc so that the summer can commence  big time . Well, almost, I hope.   After the summer I start life in performing arts school. I'll be studying Theatre and most likely English Literature. There is no way on earth I thought I'd be sat here a year ago, winning a place in Britain's only free performing arts school. Strange. This will probably become home to future posts in the summer, and when I start school.   Things are about to change."
ndf,"Okay, so I just spent $50.00 bucks on a optical mouse.  It was either that or spend the money on food or shoes.  The new pet is a Logitech MX510 optical mouse, it is a cool maroon color and if you want to buy into the sales pitch each color is unique with no two the same.  The performance spec's are what cinched the deal for me..i did not even know that they had performance specs.  I got 5.8 megapixel per second image processing, 800 DPI resolution, and the solar flare reductor units are top of the line from NASA.  So technically with all this going for me, my online gaming experience should now vastly improve as I fight for world domination with 13 year olds (yeah right).  The one, for real thing is I did find a article about the mouse in Maximum PC magazine.  It got thier trademark (kick ass award).  That has to be worth $50.00 bucks."
ndf,"In the year 2002, was my greatest regret ever. The only peson invoved and to be blamed is me. It was my fault that I did not I did not do well in my P.S.L.E. I was studying in Coral Primary school. There is where my problems started.      Firstly, I mixed around in the wrong group. I was new in Coral Primary as I had just transfered from Loyang Primary in the second month of 2000. In the beginning I thought it would be ""ok"", and the things I did were fun and I enjoyed it very much. I skipped the remedials I had every day to meet my friends in the car park. There I would spend hours to play with fire but I did not smoke. I did not pick up any bad habbits as I already knew they were to harm me. And when I went home I would tell my mum that i went for my remedials. I thought I would concentrate in my work as well as well as go out with my friends. But this did not happen. Instead I started avoiding studies. Soon, I started getting involved in more trouble and later on I started thinking that my friends were more important than my studies. When the time came, that was two years later in the year 2002, I wasen't ready. It was my P.S.L.E. It was now that I realised that my mistakes.        During my exams I went blank in my weakest subject, maths. The rest of the subjects were average. I started to panic as I knew I was going to get bad marks. In the end I did. I did very badly and got into a school I did not wnted, Siglap Secondary. At first I thought that I would do anything to get out, but as time passed, I became to know the school beter and realised it was a good place to learn in. But every where there will be ""this"" and ""thats"". There is no scholl that is perfect. Well, I was confused in what to do, I was lost but I knew that I had to adapt to it and strive to do my best. I was angry and dissapointed at myself on my mistake but I knew I had to let the past be the past. But not forget the past but learn from the mistakes. I learnt my mistakes and I know that I should not do it again. Now I have stuck this in my head that I should not mix around in the wrong company as the consequences would be unbearable and that I should pay attension in my studies. Now that I know the ""good"" and the ""bad"" and now I believe I can achieve my goal."
ndf,"Okay.. This is my first blog ever. I know i'm so not with the times. I'm like in the stone age. I'm so not a computer person so let's see how all this shit goes ay. Well i actually wrote some shit just then but yeah.. I did something which i have no idea what and yeah deleted all the crap i wrote..ahhh!! This always happens to me. I'm so born not to touch computers.. haha! Okay. It's Sat nite and guesse what Shermaine's doing?? Nothing!! Yeah it's a hell fucking moodless day for me today. Practically slept the whole day. I came home bout 1-ish from work last nite. I stayed late cuz we were all just hanging out and all. They wanted me to go over to one of their place's today, and yeah i didnt' go cuz i was sleeping and also i'm kinda afraid of getting close to any of them cuz they are my boss anyways and yeah i really don't want myself shining through too much cuz i might get fired. haha! But don't get it wrong.. I'm not a fake person infront of them at all. I'm just drawn-back a tiny bit. But yeah they're awesome people and we all get along real well so that's all good. Guesse what?? I might meet Chris tommoz. Well, we were meant to go on a road trip.. Road Trip!! But yeah I don't know.. things always get cancelled with us. But that's cool i understand i guesse.. I don't really know Chris as well as i wish i did but nah he's a sweetie. He's outgoing and he's hot!! ;) haha.. I don't think tomorrow will happen but we'll see how it goes. If not, I'd prob go to the city wit my friends from my old high school. Haven't seen them in agess!!! It's weird.. i thought i'd never lose contact with them but it's actually really hard cuz everyone's doing their own thing and yeah it's not easy. But yeah i will definitely make an effort to catch up with them every now and then. We got to! Okay, John Lennon's on telly and i wanna watch it."
ndf,"Wouldn't it be sad if from the time we were born we knew exactly where we would end up in life? I personally don't believe in fate, but it might just be because I don't want to think that I don't have control in the outcome and direction of my own personal life. I enjoy being able to think that if I wanted to, I could completely change everything, and nothing would be predetermined.  But at the same time I can't help but wonder if my life will end up the same way no matter what."

ndf,"I heard about a couple of jobs at work I applied for the other day. I didn't receive an interview. I'm pretty dissappointed about it, I thought my application was quite good... I was never expecting to get either of the jobs, there are people at work who definitely deserve them more than I but it is still a sensation not dissimiliar to a kick in the teeth. All my friends rallied around to make me feel better but of course when you feel like that there is very little someone can do to help. It's a matter of stewing for a few days and then getting over it, I am becoming a master this year it seems. I offered my application to my friends at work for there opinion, they all said it was pretty good, but I only got a truly honest opinion from one, my good friend anthony, he told me that while it was good, I used passive language which they warn you against, I really appreciate his honesty, you have to respect it. I think he might be one of those friends you meet rarely that you should try and hold on to for the rest of your life.. you can't waste a good friend. I actually feel the bunch of guys I've met in the last couple of years while working where I am, are the best I have ever made, they are not like some of the friends I had in high school who seem to use when appropriate and forget you at other times and I honestly don't think they ever thought about it, or the friends they are unwilling or just unable to share any emotions deeper than a bottle of beer with you.. at some point you must grow up.  I was told by Anthony the other day when he read this for the first time that adnd is an old acronym for Dungeons and Dragons dating back to 2nd Edition and that die-hards upon reading my first post would pick me up on it... and I have to say if that is so, then you really must start doing something more than dnd with your life, okay!

Managed to get my car cleaned and dried just as it started to rain, ah well...at least it's looking better than it was.  Btw, the text is a little bit too risque to publish on here, but it referred to the frolics of yesterday afternoon. *blushes*     Got someone else coming to see the house later this afternoon...a first-time lady buyer apparently.  Seems like the influx of Londoners coming into the sticks hasn't ceased as this is the fourth so far.  I just find it weird really that there have been ""so many"" of them...mustn't complain though if they're interested in buying the place.

ndf,"My opinion on peoples   faith   is   different  . I dont think that anyone can determine how much faith someone has, and I dont think that other people should   judge   someone elses faith. God is apart of   everyone's life   one way or another.   Mostly   everyone knows who God is and the principles behind Him. I think that the way that people   deny   Christ's name so easily is  wrong , but Im not them, so I cant make their decisions for them. But what I can do, is I can work my hardest to be a Godly   example   so that they can see what the Christian life is all about. Being a Christian   isnt   always   fun  . Yes, there are always the occansionally   disappointment   that we run into and from what I have heard, alot of people   blame God   for their   mishaps  . Well, as hard as this might sound, its all apart of God's   master plan  . God allows some misfortunes to happen, to   test   your level of faith that you might have in Him.   BUT  , know this, God will   never   test you with more than you can   handle  .  Beliving in  Christianity  or  Evolution . Either one that you believe in  requires   faith!   Faith- believing in something that you cannot see."

Well last night I drove home and as it was so sunny I decided to take some pictures of my building to show my Grandma when I next go home.  I rang my Grandma and my sister Sindy.  I have agreed to move in with my sister next year and her boyfriend Art, if I don’t they will have to move.  Their house is really nice, plenty big enough and it would be wonderful living in London.  Plus I think I will feel more ‘settled’ down there.  It would be good for Art too as he will be able to use my car.  I don’t have a job lined up but I have my long term plan sorted:  Temp/bar work and apply for proper jobs, if I don’t get proper job by January, apply for teacher training.  It’ll be fine…..  Last night I also worked on a website for work a little bit and then watched TV.  My house is a tip so tonight I think tonight I will do lots of cleaning and tidying.  I have an interview on Friday for which I should really be revising, but you know, tidying’s better than revising (ask any student!!)  Well today the sun came out again bright and hot.  It’s sad being stuck in an office on a day like this.  I’d love to be stretched out, outside with a book.  Ho hum.

Bring it On .."" but a little voice from my heart said,""are u serious about this?"" Well .. I dragged myself to Gym because I need to.  Thanks to my supportive girlfriend that said I could be able to do my all kinds of activities much faster from working out since it would stimulate both of your mind and body.  Well i think it's time for me to do my routinity, back to school in an hour and thanks God the Prof is not that boring.  O yeah .. forgot to mention about yesterday's activities .... it was a combo-day ! I did a lot of stuffs in only a single day ... i did practice of trying to imitate the solo of Dewa and Joe Satriani with my Fender Strato, I studied and worked on my homework (Finally! this is a rare thing to do), going to Gym (ran about almost 1 mile, lifted up some of machines, basketball and soccer), and called my GF =). At nite, my girlfriend threw out some matters that almost startled me ... I was surprised but on the other hand I said to myself, it;s really common to have those.   I tried to lessen her burdens, sometimes I do really want to remove all the burdens what she's got but I couldn't ... maybe I am also struggling with the same problem ...  Hopefully someday, the day when we 've matured enough would retrieve the solution. We often discussed many things and if we somewhat hurt one another's feeling, one of us standed up and said sorry. So the problem ended on that day.  Oh ... I need to prepare myself going to shcool, haven't taken a shower and breakfast ...  signed off"

ndf,"Well I think I know what my problem is. I'm not opinionated enough to own a blog. I'm totally indifferent about almost everything, so I can never think of anything to write.  Maybe I'll just write about what I did last night. Ben and I went to the park with his aunt, uncle, and cousins to watch a Tongan brass band play. We ate chicken from Sugarhouse Barbecue and it was so yummy. I don't know what their secret is, but their chicken tastes just like camping. Then the plan was to go back to the cousins' house to have brownies and ice cream and play Halo, so I asked to be dropped off at home because I didn't want to stay up all night. Plus I don't enjoy video games very often. Well they opted out of playing Halo because they wanted me to come have ice cream with them, so I went, even though I hate it when people change their plans for me. It makes me feel whimpy. So anyway, you might think that means we got home at a reasonable hour, but we still ended up staying there until midnight. I don't know how those guys (Ben's cousins/aunt/uncle) can stay up so late all of the time and still get up at 6:30 to go to work. It's hard for me! For some reason, as soon as I graduated from college, I turned into an old fart who has to go to bed on time. Totally lame.  Well it looks like I have a little bit of an opinion after all...at least about people changing their plans for me and going to bed on time. Who knew?"
ndf,"Today got nagg from mum again....if never get nagg the world will have earthquake.

ndf,"You know, I tried posting one of these twice in the last week and both times it didn't come up, so this will be the third time. If you are able to read this, then you know that it worked. if not... well blogger can fuck off and I'll go back to livejournal (or better yet start my own blog).  Anyway, tomorrow is the opening of insidepulse.com. It'll be nice to be able to read columns by my net god, Hyatte again. A week without him is like a week of not being able to jerk off. Passionless, boring, and all together unsatisfying. Now I can have a mental orgasm all over myself. Should be fun. Welcome back Cool Hy, you fucker.  Well, that is all I can think of. Now. If you'll excuse me, I plan to go stuff my face with Hostess Cupcakes. I can put a BOX away and I don't gain a pound, you bitches!!!!!!!  Reno"
ndf,urlLink    ME at School.  urlLink     This is me at school on the last day. On my next post I'll show the pics when some friends of mine go to Wendy's. Mmmmm Good.
ndf,Gah sittin at school Eric n I jes set this shit up jes checkin if it works...
ndf,"Let's try this again:)  Life is so wonderful, today I talked to my good friend Becky and she's here for a visit from Florida.  Lucky me!  We're going to get together on Monday night for a visit, and probably again Tuesday.  We've always had such a strong relationship, it doesn't matter how long between our visits they're always fun and she's so easy to be with.  She's a great MOM, and it's all she ever wanted was a family of her own.  Tonight another buddy is on his way to our home for a weekend visit, and tonight we're going out with friends.  Just trying to pack it all in before Mike and Courtney leave for AZ.  Every weekend is going to be full....full with family and friend time.  The biggest surprise is that today the weather actually cooperated, not gorgeous out but nicer than we had had lately."
ndf,"Ok...so I'm slowly getting this whole HTML crap. I've even got some links now. Hopefully I can figure out how to futher fancify my blog with some pics n' flashy stuff.  And by ""figure out"" I mean ask Beth. Frick! It's 2am and it's a work nite. I guess I'll hurl myself down the stairs so I don't have to go in tomorrow. Yea!!! No work!!!"
ndf,"Hello world!   Yes, well... umm... I've just started this journal, as you could probably tell, and I'm aiming to use it to record life as it is now for me. As for most journals, I haven't put this online to 'show it off' per say- I'm using Blogger because it's very accessible and so I can come back to memories and thoughts that I might well have forgotten in years to come. However, comments and everything are very welcome!   I hope that I'll be welcomed here well enough- I'm currently working on a layout of some kind that might come sooner or later... We'll have to wait and see!   Well, I suppose that first journal entries include a bit about the journaler, so I'll introduce myself, shall I? My name is Jennifer, but on the internet I go by the alias of Myth, I'm currently 16 and studying in 11th grade at a school in Brisbane, Australia. I'm more of a nerd than not, I guess you can say, but that's mainly because I need to study really hard to get where I want in life (in terms of a career) as I would like to become a physiotherapist, but I'm quite good at a variety of different things- I can write stories and poetry, draw to some extent and even defend myself, as I learn a martial art called  Ju Jitsu . My parents are separated, but I see them both equally, so it isn't that bad a deal, and I have two brothers- one twin brother and one half brother, who's currently six. He (the latter) is really cute, but he's also terribly annoying and (in m opinion) a little spoilt.   I like to RP (RolePlay), mainly the online kind, so you can often find me in the RP sections of forums, or MUSHing on sites like  Elendor , but most of my time is lately spent in study or at Ju Jitsu training, which is really very fun, despite all the bruises.   Well, that's about all I can think of at the moment, so I'll be off and I'll post sometime later! I plan to try a very different style of journal writing, so I'll see what I can come up with!"
ndf,"Where does one start?? I guess by telling a bit about who I am, where I have been and where I hope to go.  I live in Northern California in a little community called Yankee Hill. We are situated between the towns (cities??) of Chico and Oroville about 80 miles north of Sacramento. I live on 10 beautiful acres where I bring dogs I rescue from the pound (no sweet sounding titles like ""Animal Shelter"" here!!) and train them to work with people with disabilities.  One February 20th of 2004, we placed our programs first Service Dog to work with a young girl with Cerebral Palsy. It was a really exciting event and after following up on them for the past 3 months, they are doing really great.   I am now working with 3 other dogs. One is being trained to work as a the ears for a hard-of-hearing person who also seems to be picking up the tasks needed to assist someone in a wheelchair. Her name is Polly and we believe that she is a mix of German Shepherd and Yellow Lab.  Starr is a Black Lab mix and she is being trained to assist someone with a wheelchair. Her progress seems to be slower, but I am still hoping that she will pass the program. If not, we will find her a good home as a pet or possibly keep her to be our demonstration dog. The only real problem with her is that she is not real confident in big city environments. She is about 15 months old, so there is still time to help her overcome her issues.  Then we have Mocha, a Chocolate Lab. We chose her for a specific client who has a spinal condition that is making it progressively harder for him to walk on his own. Mocha is being trained to wear a harness with a handle that he can hang onto and offer him balance and stability. We have only been working with her for a couple months. She also has had some issues for us to help resolve, the most major is a fear of having either her ears or tail touched as if she was picked up by them at some time. The other is that she has had a hard time staying in one place when someone moves near her. Both of these things are being addressed and we are having great success with her developing more confidence in a variety of situations.  Well, that is a start. I'll stop here and see how this looks and pick it up again later this evening. TA TA"
ndf,"But there are a couple of things I've been thinking about.  Does it make me a bad person that I want to just quit my alumni group?  Here's the problem -- I'm the president of our chapter.  I have been for about a year and a half.  But it's not like I volunteered for it . . . or at least not without a bit of arm twisting from the ex-president.  And now I can't find anyone to arm twist myself.  And I want out!!  There's just not enough time in the day to dream up events, organize them, send out a mass email announcing them, reply to responses, etc.  Then I have to actually show up at the event -- early to get seats -- and talk to people.  Well, the talk to people part isn't horrible.  The showing up early is the one that always kills me.  I have to show up early enough to ensure enough seats for everyonee who's coming (half of which probably didn't RSVP), but late enough that I don't have to fight off the waitor for TOO long with promises of a coming party.  Uchhkk.  Let's see . . . what else.  Oh yeah -- I finally found a new apartment!  I'm pretty excited.  It's a one bedroom, so I'll be living by myself for the first time ever.  That's pretty nifty in some aspects . . . I can clean at my own pace (and only clean up after myself).  I can invite people over (or not) at my own discression.  I can decorate exactly as I like.  It'll be like heaven.  Except . . . I'm hoping I don't become a hermit.  Someone at work today joked that I'll be a cat lady.  I won't buy a cat -- I promise!!!  Hopefully it won't be so bad.  My current roommate will still be relatively close (she and her fiancee are moving in together).  My cousin will moving (with his wife) to a condo VERY close to my new place -- that'll be pretty nifty, cause I think we might be good friends -- we've never lived close enough to try before, but I've always enjoyed hanging out with him (and his wife) when I've gotten the chance.  Oh -- and I'll moving close to some friends-of-a-friend that I'm decently good friends with, too (and that I've always wanted to be better friends with).  So hopefully it'll all turn out well.  And it's a damn cute apartment  :-)"
ndf,Hey well today I am getting ready for my vacation I am leaving Friday for florida this will be the forth year in a row I have gone there and I have also noticed this month there will be like no one at our church because most of our members are either going on vacation or have already left well thats all for now I will right later if you would like to check out some other good websites then go to one of the following: http://jonkb1.blogspot.com/ http://www.notsomebodyelse.blogspot.com/ http://www.teamxcroations.blogspot.com/

ndf,"Ok, so I set this up to reply to my friend Derek's blog and now I feel compelled to write something. All right, that is a lie... this is the first page it popped up to after setting up my account (again in order to respond to Derek) and I'd hate to have an empty blog and make it seem like I have nothing to say.    Big news of the day: today is the day my condo goes on the market. Yup, after over a year in glorious Chelmsford, I have decided to pack up and move back down to the Boston area. With the exception of Derek, all my friends live walking distance to the T and I count the number of times people have driven up to visit me on one hand. Ok, maybe 2, but definitely no toes! I guess I bought the place hoping to settle down there in the near future with my then beau, but things change and you need to accept that and move on, right? Hey, I may even make a profit off of it. I would accept a $20,000 mistake ;-)"

ndf,"Well I finally got around to trying out this blogger- even though I've had the google toobar for ages, *and* was a loyal googler long before that.  Silly me.  I first tried to blog with a different blogger site, and To Tell You The Truth, I didn't like the feel.  Oh, it was simple enough, if awkward, but the 'home' page of the blogging site was so darn busy I felt lost there.     This place is so much better. I should have gone with what I knew was a tried and true service.  Anyways, this is my dumping ground.  Stuff I find on the internet that I must squawk about (good and bad), late night frustrations and nightmares, and the occasional proud parenting moment (or self flaggellation over same)-- all will be posted here so I can embarrass my family and bore strangers.  I hope you'll drop in occasionally."
ndf,"And so begins the life of my blog, a true understanding of what it is to be bloggish. Okay, so maybe I made that word up. I thought I would begin my disadvantageous interest in blogging for the first time. I have read many and participated in none. Creating this posting off of pure allurement of the idea has been quite interesting and (hopefully) stays that way. Today I create, and juxtapose the ideas of life and wonderment of a being, which whom, has a slightly higher interest in being more than most. With this, I bid you farewell until next time, for now I have work to do."
ndf,"Still haven't gotten very far in the planning and execution of the ""Get my Life in Order"" desire.  I just can't seem to take that next step that will get me where I want to be.  I still weigh the same.  My finances are just as bad.  And getting worse.  I feel drawn to write and to voice over work, but can't bring myself to act on that conviction.  I know what I need to do to make my life work, but am stuck at the same old place.  I want to be the person God created me to be more than anything else.  What do I have to lose right?  I don't like where I am, but it's familar, but I'll never realize my potential if I don't.  HELP!!!!!!!!!!"
ndf,"Hey, I feel like its been awhile, when in all relativety, my mind is always thinking and it feels like awhile, because things come and go in my head, and by the time, i get to this very ""subject"" of this post, I have been through many other subjects as well.  First off,   to get it off my mind, I just saw the movie ""little black book"" and ending said something like, life happens most, when you are planning for something that is approaching. So stop planning and live your life now. That totally goes against my life, because I have always been the planner, because then I think that I get what I want. But what if I didnt plan, and got what I needed the most, and secretly wanted the most too. But then if you dont plan at all, you could be a loser who doesnt do anything. Conflicting thoughts. I have always told myself not to plan so much, its just that it comes so naturally to me, to plan for college, plan why someone likes me, plan how i mangage my friends, money...everything. Maybe I will start by unplanning some of those things..and letting them come to me. One small thing at a time. I suppose.   we;ll talk soon. Caitlyn"
ndf,"My brother and I were at a mall yesterday with two of our closest friends, Carly and Jessica.  I realized something yesterday, no matter what has happened in our lives they have always been there through good and bad times.  I realized that whenever I need someone to talk to I have always been able to count on the twins to listen and to tell me their opinions.  They have always been at our house growing up, whenever school let out, they'd be over for sure. Its hard for me to think of days when they haven't been over at our house. The four of us have done practically everything together.   They are two of my true friends. I have very few friends that I could say that about.  Not many people know me as well as these gals. Now that we are getting older our lives will most likely be keeping us from seeing each other as much as we have in the past, but I know that no matter where we are we will be friends. They have meant so much to me in my life that I can't even explain to you in this one simple blog. I have tried my best to show you, but this is only a scratch of the surface of what these two mean to me. I just hope that I have been as good a friend to them as they both have been to me.  It is there birthday today and I just want to wish a happy birthday to two of the greatest people I know.  Happy 16th."
ndf,"Which I already knew, of course, but I am feeling pretty sorry for myself. Three and a half weeks ago I tore ligaments in my left knee, effectively curtailing most fun for the next several months. PMO!!! Anyway - the good news is that the bruising has now faded, the swelling is down, I can walk further than I could even a couple days ago. The bad news is that I am still wearing this silly brace and using a cane. The physiotherapist said I ""did a real number"" on my LCL and illotibial band (sp?) and can expect the healing process to take a while. It could have been worse right? I could have broken my leg or completely torn the LCL. It could have been my right leg and I wouldn't be able to drive.   So much for paddling this summer. At this point I still can't bend my knee far enough to get or out of a boat. I CAN still do weights though and I had a short somewhat successful trial on my indoor bike a couple days ago. I walked around the bloack today too - not exactly the 10km run I wished I was doing, but a few days ago I could only make it halfway around and today the whole loop was easy. Progress, progress.  My plan for tomorrow is to get up and ride my bike (indoors again) after I do my physio exercises."
ndf,"so first and foremost i have to give credit to nichole who brought me up to 2004 and introduced me to this whole blog thing. i have a feeling i am going to become an addict.   so i signed up for this and they asked me to fill out a profile and then proceeded to cut and paste whatever they wanted out of it. example, i wrote a whole paragraph about how i was so happy that they made the question ""name your favorite books"" because usually it just asks for one but then proceeds to ask for your favorite TV showS. i capitalize the S because they want it to be plural. as if you should be watching more TV and reading less. i guess it's easier and most people filling out these surveys are not interested in writing for hours about their favorite reads, but instead about what happened last night in nick and jessica. actually i could tell you because secretly kate and i watch it and then wonder what it would be like if MTV came and filmed us....i'll leaving wanting more only because my point of this is i am being censored in the wrong way. you see i promote reading and educating yourself, you know seeking the truth, finding your own path and they cut that shit out. what the f**k? oh i just realized this is correct, oh my bad this is the new interpretation of the first ammendment. sorry thanks for the correction. i forgot we are all suppose to be getting our news from FOX and nevermind the independent thinking it wears on the brain, let someone else do it for you. okay nevermind, just disregard what i just wrote and recommence status quo.  so already i love this blog thing except i don't think anyone is going to read it. but it's okay i already feel better, it's like free therapy...i mean someone may read it and laugh or think oh this poor girl, how pathetic...but whatever i can write about all my shit and if kate wants to catch up on what i am thinking (because she always says, ""i don't know what you are thinking"") she can log on and read instead of strong arming me into watching nick and jessica."
ndf,"I'm sitting here at 2:30 A.M. wondering . . . is it possible to fall in love with a place?  Is it possible to want to be somewhere so much that you would forsake everything . . . just to have a moment in that place?  I think that is what Chicago is to me, as corny as that may be.  I'm interviewing for jobs at the moment, and I can't sleep.  Part of me really wants the job, but another part wants to fly on a whim.  I know what I   should   do, but there is a great difference between what you should do and what you want to do.  I am so nervous right now--about the job, about the possibility of moving, about everything.  I'm literally at a time in my life when I am in serious upheaval.  It's a transition period, and I don't like it.  I wish I had a crystal ball that would tell me where I will be in five years, ten, twenty even.  Maybe then I would know the path that I am supposed to take.  But no one can tell you that, can they?  You can only do what you feel you should and hope that it is the right decision.  Jen"

Now I'll admit, it wasn't exacltly the star filled night of enjoyment that I hoped for but hey, you can't have everything. But I did, as I do every year, made my new years resolutions that night because for me, the 19th of august is my new year. I decided to have these as my resolutions:  1.Do a couple of pages of notes or one page of new writing everyday.  2.Actually start wearing the nice clothing that people buy for me, and even experiment with a colour that isn't black.  3.Socialise quite a bit more often.  What do you guys think?  What resolutions have you guys ever made?  Josh"
ndf,"One day this was bound to happen. So it is just as well that it is today May 21st 2004 that I open my very own blog. I hope I will enjoy it, and I hope you may all just as well. Keep your fingers crossed for me and my words. Soon you will know more about me than my email account knows, my personal page knows and my mobile phone knows. And that says something. So just keep your eyes on pavol.blogspot.com and you may be surprised."
ndf,"Wouldn't it be sad if from the time we were born we knew exactly where we would end up in life? I personally don't believe in fate, but it might just be because I don't want to think that I don't have control in the outcome and direction of my own personal life. I enjoy being able to think that if I wanted to, I could completely change everything, and nothing would be predetermined.  But at the same time I can't help but wonder if my life will end up the same way no matter what."

ndf,"My first blog.. Man I used to wonder what a blog really is and now am blogging  ;o)  ... I am techie from india (I know nowadays being a techie from India is very dangerous) slogging out ... enjoying myself...But have some serious doubts about certain new things that I am discovering...  Quality  is a wonderful sounding word and my initiation into Project Management exposed me to a world of  jargons, metrics, templates and of course complete non-sense . I know that I may be chided for writing that, but let me clarify. On the set I am a devotee (right word) of the world of mathematics which never ceases to amaze me and Statistics, cos its just wonderful. During one of the great training days, it was conveyed, Statistics shouldn't be employed to misrepresent the data and now I wonder if it is the whole process is to do so. Information is available very abundantly and I guess we have surplus than we can consume. I wonder if generation of information is the basis of quality. Which comes to my first question ? Does adhering to quality standards mean ""keep your common sense @ home and come"". I wonder if the purists of statistics are the ones to satisfy. Cmon.. I wonder what possible information can be derived out of one's coffee breaks, one's mails and definitely the winner, How many lines of code I can dish out ? wonder if they know that I can eternally keep on putting braces, new lines, comments, star, hashes etc and they all contribute to code. Yeah Yeah I know, we have tools that can take care of these, but is this an indicator of a person's ability... Wonder what good is the information for... Begs the second question.. I get the common answer.. information may be useful down the line.. Yes it may be and may not be.. Going by the theory of probability it is equi-probable... I guess quality is used to ensure that the product being manufactured is in accordance with the best-practices in the industry (for starters) and more importantly, you learn from your current process to refine the same.. I think refinement is the catch and I guess it can be done in more than one way than generate some junk metrics..Wonder how the process can be refined from measuring no. of lines dished out in a day... Look forward to people's views... Hey feel free to drop in and drop a line... Hope this blog goes a long way... Time to hit off..."
ndf,"The other day Jay and I went with a few of his friends to celebrate our birthdays.  Some of us had fun at On the Border.  Then we went to see Anchorman.  About the only part of the movie that I liked was the soundtrack.  My husband doesn't understand my sense of humor.  Yes of course there were parts of the movie that were funny, but other than that I didn't like it that much.  I am just not that big of Will Ferrell fan.  Big woop on seeing him chest exposed.  It looks like he permed his chest hair to get it that curly.  I would have rather seen the Terminal or Chronicles of Riddick. Ohhh Well.  A girl can dream."
ndf,"I awoke this morning in a foul mood.  Why??  I don't really know.  I had become a little testy on the phone with my girlfriend last night but not enough to justify it carrying over to the next day.  One thing I do know is it is setting the precedence for the rest of the day, which isn't really surprising as once I get in a foul mood it is extremely hard to pull myself up out of the trenches of self loathing and hatred.  I've been at work for the last 4 hours and have thus far accomplished nothing, at least a lot more nothing then what I usually accomplish while at work.  In recent times I have slipped from a model employee to the try to do as little as possible disgruntle employee, reason being my boss recently hired a new employee and our office is turning into a good ole boys club where I being of the opposite sex feel out of place.  I work at a university and have worked in the same department for the past four years, my official job title is Computer Support Assistant yet my responsibilities have grown much since I started gainful employment here.  Yet now I’m feeling under appreciated as the new guy is getting paid more than me and is perhaps destined, in the near future, for a pay rise, just to stick the knife in a little deeper.    You could argue that his job title carries more clout then mine as he is officially known as a Web Developer, yet I as a lowly old Computer Support Assistant should technically be paid less, yet it appears that I have moved from the illustrious realm of shit kicker to web developer over the years, yet I still kick the shit when ever someone is in.  Technically we should be on an equal playing field, yet this too doesn’t seem to be the case.  Because I have been here the longest I am given the added responsibility of maintaining our servers while my boss lays on a beach somewhere smelling of coconut oil and slowly burning flesh.   But alas it is not to be, I must suffer in silence, I know I’ve not been very silent.  I do however feel much better now after this little venture, perhaps my foul mood was simply due to pent up frustrations which have since subsided as a result of this writing.  I feel better now and perhaps well enough to do some real work."
ndf,"I'm mentally preparing myself for my journy into Western Psyche. I told myself that Monday, one week from the last time I went, I would return.  So I now wonder what this will be like now.  Seeing her again.  I did blow her off. But I have just given myself the time I needed to get my mind back in order. This one week crawled by.  Seemed like an eternity.  I woke up this morning.  A gagging noise, then a forced heave as I stared blankly at the ceiling.  Too scared to move.  Then a surryingoff and the patter of  little kitten feet.  I knew that my cat threw up on my damn bed. I slid my feet up, and boldly looked down.  Yes indeed, but not just a small pile, a stream across the whole quilt.  At least four feet long.  That was it.  I just got up. 6:30 AM.  Went downstairs and watched All in the Family recordings.  Damn funny show at times.    I am falling deeper and deeper in love with Sarah Vowell.  I learned a few days ago that she is an Athiest.  She is a Democrat.  She is my oasis in this world of unlogical happenings. She is so beautiful. I will marry her someday, I know it in the deepest parts of my soul. The sticky parts."
ndf,"Hoss is my bulldog (for anyone that sees this but doesn't know me), and he is a spoiled one at that. This how we have found him when we came home on several occasions. You can't see it in the picture, but there was a Corona on the railing and his daddy was grilling hamburgers for us...including him.  I wonder what he does that we don't see...maybe I don't want to know, eh?  Anyway, he does weigh at least 62 lbs here. He still thinks he's small enough to be a lap dog, and will climb up in my lap every time he gets tired just to prove it. Of course, at that point I am pinned and have to move a mountain to get up out of the chair. But he has more kisses than I can stand sometimes, and plenty left over for anyone that comes to visit.  I'm definitely a Bulldogger!"
ndf,"Almost everyone I know online is saying BLOG. What is it I ask and after reading a few from those I know, I learned that it’s an open journal; that almost everyone online can read. “But why, isn’t a journal supposed to be private?” I asked. Some say that they want their life to be an open book and others may say “well I don’t really post everything that happened.” Still, I am a bit off with this.  So in order to know more of this, I decided to make my own so I may experience and learn about this thing called blog. This will be something from what I do and I don’t know what will happen. Only time can tell."
ndf,Well today is Augest 14 and this is the first posting of my first blog ever and I will write alot everyday so check back every night for some reading if your bored! Well first let me tell you a bit about me and where I live... My name is Trevor Nederlof I'm 15 and I live in a town called Westport which is in connecticut. I have a younger brother (Andrew) who is 13 as well as a black lab (Chloe) who is 10. We just moved to a new house near a river which goes through our small sized town. I am a geek because I love computers but at the same time I have a strong love for sailing... every type of boat may it be 10-150 feet I have done it all and love every moment of it.                 Last night I saw Aliens Vs. Predator which was a great action movie and I recommend it to everyone. Then I woke up at 3am to watch my cousins boyfriend artor  row in the olympics on a 2 man boat. I was tired when I awoke at 8am I started to unpack my room and help my cousin Jake who works for my mom take alot of the boxes from our move to the dump in town. I met my best friend David Brenner  (Everyone calls him Brenner) in town and we rode on bikes back to my house where we watched Da Alie G Show which is the funniest show EVER. After Brenner left I basicly just played computer games while helping my aunt and grandmother with the boxes from the move. Well Pizza will be here soon so I should go...           Look forward everynight by 8pm est (1 am GMT) I will post on my blog and I hope you all share with others so they to can read my life lol. Until tomarrow enjoy life because you only live once :)
ndf,"So...I didn't lose any weight last week. This is not surprising, being that I had the most bizarre cravings, and thus binged a few times. I didn't gain weight, so I'm not going to complain too much...So still...we're at 233. I dunno what the hell is wrong with me, but I'm actually going to call a doctor. I've got to be hella sick or feel really damn bad to even consider such a thing. But I hurt, I've been up all night, and the shit has got to stop. Drugs...that's what I need.  Bucky. Hehe, what can I say besides that? I absolutely cannot believe the whirlwind of feeling and emotion that has come to me as a result of him. Last weekend was so, so wonderful. I miss him so much. I never, ever intended to fall in love or to let emotion get involved. I mean, how taboo is it to see a married man? However, when the said couple is poly....I mean, why not? He says he can love me and love Megan too, and that he isn't going anywhere. So I'm just going to have fun, enjoy the ride for as long as it lasts, and hopefully, learn from the experiences. Regardless, I love him. It's been a long time since I felt love for a man. It's hard to admit to myself, but I do want him, and to a certain extent, maybe I even think that I need him. There is some connection there that I can't put my finger on. I've no idea what it is...maybe a past life or something.  Anyway, onto the doctor callings I go."

Anyway, I had a realli good nite and i gona treasure it. :) Wednesday 30 June 04 03.00am"
ndf,"I started talkin to this awesome guy I had met on  plentyofish.com about  two weeks ago we would talk every night for at least 5 hours a night.  He seemed to be everything I wanted in a man and he had made  me believe that I was everything he wanted in a woman, we had shared pictures a lot of pictures so he new what I looked like and I new what he looked like, well this guy was just to good to be true just a wonderful man he would tell me he loved me and how he wanted a future with me. He decided that he had to come see me so after two weeks of talkin and getting to know eachother through conversation  he shows up on my door step at around 1 am on Saturday morning. I aswered the door and he was just as beautiful as his pictures but I could tell I wasn't everything he imagined id be. I still had a day and a half with this guy and I new he didn't like me the way he said he did because of the way I looked can you imagine the heartache of rejection when its slapped in your face?Well he ended up staying the whole time and we had a nice time, we took my girls to see a movie and he came to my mothers house for dinner and what not! We did sleep together but I feel like he did it out of pity for me. It just hurts to be rejected by someone who tells you they love you and how beautiful you are,I told him how scared I was to meet him cause I didn't want to disappoint him but he said ""what do you think I'm a shallow person? I think your beautiful and I want to be with you"". So now here I am 2 days later not one phone call from him and a broken heart to deal with!"

ndf,"Wow, yep I havent written in here in like two weeks atleast, but I'm not gonna try to put a shitload of stuff in here. I got my senior pictures back yesterday, and they're actually pretty good. Or atleast like 4 of em are... I'm hoping that I'll still be able to get professional ones, even though I don't really need them haha it's just fun to have your picture taken man.  I've still got to read this god-awful book for English ...Heart of Darkness... one kid put it very nicely:     ""This is one of the most poorly and confusingly done novels ever written. With such an interesting plot, I was amazed at how utterly boring and clouded the novel became, the only reason this novel is still in print is because english teachers get hard-ons through mental masturbation trying to analyze this overly ambiguous work."""
ndf,"Well, I've never done a ""blog"" before so you'll have to grade me on a curve.  Today was another fun visit to the dentist.  Turns out, that tooth #27 (yes, it's that specific) needed a root canal.  To really be able to focus on that particular tooth, my dentist found it neccesary to use a dental dam.  All I could think of was sex ed. in high school talking about dental dams for oral sex.  If anyone I was with pulled out a dental dam, I wouldn't be able to run away fast enough.  My day was quite uneventful otherwise. Other news:  I am missing someone that is very important in my life. Recently, I had to ""restrict"" a friendship with someone I care deeply about because her fiance isn't such a big fan of me.  It really sucks but I know that things will work out for the best and that nothing is impossible :) Until next time, God bless and good night."
ndf,"Today, i got english result and i fail lah. got a scolded by my mum . dun wish to write anymore ."
ndf,"Right now, I'm in a room with someone. A very goodlooking guy with a nice body to match his face. He's sleeping and I can't do anything about it. Oh well, that's life."

ndf,"This is dedicated to my uncle, who died on duty at the age of 29, doing police work...       The Day I Cried   ------------------------------------            “Those that I fight I do not hate,        Those that I guard I do not love;”  - (An Irish Airman Foresees His Death, W.B. Yeats)      It was all white in the room,    The corpse in his winding sheet,    My aunt in a new white sari,    Staring into the silence where he had gone.    I could hear the leaves rustle outside the window, But I didn’t cry.      She had gone crazy, my mom whispered,    Between her sobs, “She is just 25, the poor girl”    I just continued to look down,    At the mosaic floor, not registering a word.    I could hear the white saris softly flapping, But I couldn’t cry.      My cousin sister came to me,    Dressed in her prettiest frock for the occasion.    She was five, did she understand?    I took her out to buy her chocolate.    I could hear the neighbors’ shushing as we went by, But I still didn’t cry.      On my way back in the train,    Three passengers were discussing the police,    “All corrupt sons of bitches – they deserve to die”    I remembered you, uncle, so proud of your uniform.    I could still hear my aunt screaming as nani lit your pyre, That’s when I cried.    --V."
ndf,"After  the NDP,we went for our very late dinner....At the stadium there was free face painting, of course i went for the face painting...but i didn't paint on my face lah,i paint on my arm.There was free food but the ice-cream is relly expensive luckily my mum didn.t buy or not she will have to spend lots of money on it. We got 9 free goodie bags but we actually suposse to have 7 only but my mum took 2 extra bags so thats why we have 9 bags but luckily she gave some of tha bags to her friends...I like the FIREWORKS the best during th celebration,i just love fireworks. When walking back to our parking lot at BOON KENG MARKET,there was lots of people i nearly fell on the drain but luckily my sister get hold of me...FUH! We finally reached home at 11pm. It was tiring but all of us were happy.."
ndf,"so this weekend, my husband and i are heading to oklahoma so he can scuba in a lake it should be interesting. I will be watching from the land.  he is going to be a ""body"" for scuba people to ""find"" as part of a search and rescue class.  He used to scuba dive a lot in the past - he swears he saw a shark while diving in Hawaii, though couldn't take a picture of it underwater- guess he was too freaked out or something.  we'll see how it goes."
ndf,"Yeah, so today I wasted sitting around doing nothing, but wishing that I could do other things. I should stop sitting around not doing anything about it, but I don't know. Maybe this right now is just pms I don't know haha. I wish that whole deal with Brendan never happened. I really liked him alot, and as much as we all say this, he was different. He is different, I swear it. I was so so upset when he said we couldn't be together, but I didn't tell him. maybe I should have. I didn't want to put more on his shoulders though, so maybe i did the right thing? Either way, now for some reason he's upset, though he doesn't tel me anything anymore. so I don't know, maybe him and amanda got in a fight. Maybe his dads being stupid. Oh well. Moving on..  Justin pissed me off today, well kind of. Originally i was going to take a day off of work on the 12th to go to ozzfest with him. Now he was whinning about a hurt ankle, I told him take some painkillers get a brace and lets go. The he made the excuse of his mom was being dumb about it. He's just a talker i think, but then again I am too. I try not to be, but its just how things go sometimes I guess. I need to work on that.  I feel so sick right now, all because of the stupid period. Rawr guys should have to go through this. Then again I don't have to worry about boners or blue balls or any of that guy stuff. So I guess its all good.  Another 3rd of July that I won't be doing anything for. Darn. Oh well next year should be good, maybe charles, his friend and i will all end up throwing a party. If that actually happens where I'd move in with him. Who knows, I've got plenty of time to plan anyways.  I hate stupid drama. Especially people who just start it cause they want something to talk about and look cool with. so so stupid. Then again I don't know. maybe i do to..I hope not hah. Oh well.  blah I'm going to go take a shower and figure out something to do hopefully.  End"
ndf,"During the last week of March 2004, two friends and I were on a road trip to New Orleans for spring break. The three of us fell for a police trap and were arrested in Stone County, Mississippi. My two friends were charged with misdemeanors for possession of marijuana and I was charged with a felony for possession of a controlled substance. I took the wrap for the six hits of acid we had in the car because the two of them had recently discovered they were going to have a baby. If I hadn't taken the blame, all three of us would have been charged with felonies and the two of them would be in much more trouble now than I am.  Flash forward to today...  I am 23 years old. I am a college graduate (Bachelors in Communication  ; Art). I am employed by my father (who spent $4,800 to bail me out of jail). I work as a detailer, graphic designer, and a networking technician. On the weekends I work for an entertainment company as a disc jockey. I have a $3,000 credit card debt, a $17,000 student loan debt, and a $4,800 debt to my parents. One day, within the next year or two, I will have to go to court for the felony. Right now, I barely make enough money to pay my bills and some how I have to save for lawyer fees. Any ideas grounded in reality on how to handle this situation?"
ndf,"Who else loves the rain?, i know I do. And today it rained all day.  I got a chance to walk around barefoot in the woods in the rain.  I am at peace... However, tomorrow I have to get a brain scan... That ought to be a blast! nnnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooootttttttttttttt. Last time I did that they made me hold my breath whenever the scanner went over me.  And the tube was really cold, yecch.  I hope all goes well, I really would rather not hear that I need some sort of surgery.  But if I do have surgery there is a pro, I get HOSPITAL SOCKS!!!!  Those are so nice, they have the little sticky pads on the bottom, and they are ever so warm.  The con of the situation is having to wear a gown.  I always imagined having to wear one, and waking up after anesthesia with a face drawn on my butt secretly, damn doctors..... I'm off te finish me book. g'night"
ndf,"Have You Ever Noticed That Every Couple Of Years Of So, You Notice You Really Never Cared About Something. For Me, The First Thing Was The Friends Televisoin Show On The WB.  I Know It Sounds Funny, But I Almost Felt As Though I Was Growing Too Old Too Quickly. I Still Feel The Same Way. When I Was Younger, It Was Completly Different.  I Wished I Could Gett Magically Older, Or Taller So I Could Do The Things That The Older Kids Got To Do.  Now I Think About It, It Was Never Really That big Of A Deal Like I Made It Out To Be.     I'm Soo Not Ready For Highschool.  Everyone Else, It Seems, Are All Excitd, But I'm Scared. I Don't Even Know Why, Really, It's Not That I'm Afraid I'll ""Get My Ass Kicked,"" As My Sister Says, I Think It's More About After Highschool.

ndf,"Hi pplz!  I just started this blog thing and I have to learn how to use it. Today is a school free day.  It is boring, but some friends are coming over and I have no idea why...I want to go swimming. Last weekend, I went to Callaway Gardens (which was boring), the mall (stayed the whole frikin day, my feet hurted a lot!), Asian Square (got a fan with calligraphy written on it), the movies (saw Troy), I made a Dir en Grey CD, washed my aunts car (got paid $10), and tasted a Latte from Dunkin Donuts for the first time, those damn lattes are strong! I wanted a Donut! But I was broke. Damn. Hope today will go fine..."
ndf,"ahhh, finally I've got a day off today from the joke I spend 60 hours a week at called work. I'm in the process of sending out resumes...again...  I really hate that I can't seem to find anything more than a dead end job. Finding a career isn't what I want either...but I need something that pays well enough for me to be able to live. Maybe I should just join a band that needs a good guitarist and cash in...but the problem is I like a lot of what's out there, but I certaniy don't want to play it...lol. It's too much like selling your soul to me.   I'm so stuborn...but it's got to happen on my terms in order for me to be able to live with myself...lol. It helps though that I'm going ahead in the right direction, even if it feels like it's taking forever.  That said, tonight I'm fixed on making some magic happen...I don't even know how yet..all I know is I'm going into the studio and it's going to come through.    Someday it's going to be to a point where I'm going to not be able to justify the waste of time my job is...and I'm going to be consumed by this thing we call music...I just hope by that point I've at least got a band together so I can play it...lol..."
ndf,This is my first entry at blogger.com ever. I don't know what to say. Hi Nikole.
ndf,"Hola!!! Guten tag!!! Hi!! Bonjour!!! Thix our first blog! Sorry, we are virgins!! We decided to get a blog becuse my friend Vampta said it would be fun ky-and she said that we are mire likely to get busness as mail brides? For americans men?    We are austrian twins and we want to go to america for marage. Our english is ok, I think!! Sorry, this is Reginka, just now! My sister is in the john,tee hee-i think my english is getting better!!! We know somebody, from London, his name is Peter and we are staying with him just now in London and he helps us with our english though Minka finds it hard or 'ard (Peter) to understand and I do not understand much better. Peter says this cite should help improve our english so we can go out more!! Stop us that does not!!!    English men are so cool. They funny and make us laugh. There accents please me lots!! We at university study the English but I think we are not doing well! We do not bother, we want to go to america and they are speaking different english there!!! It sounds like fun!!     this is MinkA. What shall you like to know about us,you leave us a note und we will tell you of us. In London the life is much different than in Austria. we have lived in a little villge there and there was little life of the night. We sneek to big village to have the fun good, we did with much men. They are liking twi ns. Many of the men are saying we are being there dream fuck. I don't know. Heer the men are more quiet but of equal heatness. We are liking them. I am less good than my sister at the english, but I am also much more flexible, I am told. We have the big hope to meet the men American so we can be to America going and engage in marryage with them. Peter has good friend to us and he is also quite sexual.

We go now, by, by xxxxxxxxxxxxxxoooooooooxxxxxxxxxxxx"
ndf,"God!! If I could go back in time I would go to a sperm bank instead of having to deal with a dumb$$ baby daddy! well at one point he was my husband but now he has the title of baby daddy if I could call him that! Some men are so worthless that they make some women turn lesbians! I have tried in every way to deal with him and nothing! I tried been nice, getting angry and basically not giving a f***! and nothing! I get no emotion from him but some how everything is my fault! and I guess he is right, cause its my fault I got involved with him sorry a$$! The only thing that upsets me now is that my son is growning up with out a dad! Financially we don't need him cause I have a good job, but a child always need his two parents and when one is out, well there is only soo much the other parent can do. And sad to say that I know I'm not the only women dealing with a sorry baby daddy and the thing is that he isn't hurting me but he is hurting someone he created and has his same blood, his SON!! Maybe us as women are more connected with our emotions and I couldn't picture not seeing my son for months and men just go on with their life without a care about it! Clubbing and living the single life when we have to stay home and be responsible mothers and take care of our kids with double responsibilities cause while they are out creating more babies! All I know is that I'm doing the best I can and my son will know that I gave him everything he needed...and he will also know that his dad choose not to participate in his life....and as for his dad, well---- PAYBACK IS A B****!!!! ONE DAY HE WILL GET HIS!"
ndf,"Well for someone with an abundance of thoughts spilling out of her head, I'm having difficulty committing to writing them down. Maybe it's the heat, as we usually experience a much shorter summer . It's not as green and lush here as in previous summers. This global warming isn't just talk.      People are coming and going in my household. My youngest son Kevin has just returned from his week long summer camp. I was abit horrified to find that he had certainly packed along a visually controversial book for a christian based camp. I'm glad they didn't find it in his possession. They might've freaked out just looking at it, (Diablo, legacy of blood). He's almost fourteen and plays Diablo on the computer all the time. It looks like a skeletal grim reaper on the cover of it. Ahh, the joys of a young teenage boy. The sounds of his drumkit pounding on a summer's day, with our windows open for the neighbourhood to enjoy. The young teenage 'friend that is a girl' that comes to call, all giggles and cute.      My 'middle child', Kimberly, now twenty and working hard is two weeks away from flying back east to start her third year of university in Toronto. The anguish she'll experience to leave her boyfriend behind, once again. Been there, done that, but what does a Mom know. I think she's got it made, with her girlfriend in a great apartment downtown Toronto. Two girls going to school and experiencing life in a big city. Wish I had that opportunity at that age. What's the rush for commitment? I don't know too many young guys with a game plan at twenty. And that is alright, so they take abit longer to figure it out. Why botch them up forcing them to make decisions concerning women at such a young age? But I am the Mom, what do I know about such things. Hmmm.      I have one more 'child'. At this age, my least stressful one. Trevor, he's twenty-two. He's working full time, does apprenticeship training six weeks out of the year, he's doing OK, not too much to worry about there. He's a happy guy. His PIA days were when he was about 14- 16. He's got a very nice girlfriend, keeps him in line.      Well maybe I'll stop there for today.My real stresses are in the toothful tales of working in my dental office. I'll save that for another day...."
ndf,"SUMMER SUCKS!  I know, I know...*my* opinion. My computer's not working right, so I can't use my MSN messenger and Yahoo barely works. Therefore, I haven't been able to talk to the majority of my friends this summer. Phones are always busy or they're not home. Or, like my best friend, Jimmy, too busy with his girlfriend to talk to me... Not to mention that I've been working alot lately. I got my permit last Friday, so I've been driving alot lately, lol, which is fun, damn near gave my mom a heart attack on several occasions. LOL. Well, I'll post again later."
ndf,"Sometimes I have a crazy notion that runs through my head.  It's actually more like a recurring question that puzzles me at odd times and places but usually when I see some otherwise taken for granted ingenious invention.  For example, it happened this past Sunday as I sat in an Emergency Room waiting area (a friend had been bitten by a dog...) as I watched the automatic sliding glass doors.  What a wonderful and convenient invention.  A sensor detects your presence and opens the door.  Then it hit me...What would Benjamin Franklin think of that?   I think of Ben and what he would think quite often when I hear the telephone ring, see airplanes in the sky or cars on the road.  Just the idea of electricity (that covers lights, the radio, television, motion pictures...The list is endless), the concept of the internal combustion engine, the physics of flight...  Just think of how much fun it would be to tool around with Ben showing him all the things we've manage to create.  Can you imagine explaining how man has walked on the moon?  How would he react to hearing that we have a satellite circling, capturing data, recording it and reporting back to Earth from the planet Saturn?  We have come so far and have so much.  Ben would be very impressed with everything...   That's usually when another of my recurring thoughts hits me.  He'd be impressed with all the gadgets and inventions but eventually he'd see what kind of society we've become.  He'd be appalled by our lack of education in light of all the technological marvels.  Sure, it took a smart person somewhere to figure out the concepts of the new technology...But look what we've given up in return.  For all our efforts we have people that can't read and write...People that don't have or use their imaginations...People that can't think for themselves...People that are happiest doing no more than mindlessly doing nothing.  Our Great Society has become stupid, ill mannered, uncaring and lazy.  It's a shame really.  And I'm certain that Ben wouldn't like it..."
ndf,"Ok...This gonna be a long story. There were a couple in the XXX school. They were both secondary 2 at that time. They loved each others deeply. The girl shall be named Yi. The boy shall be named Le. They would sms each others telling how much they love each others everyday. They will greet each other morning and bla bla bla~  Yi does not treat Le very well but Le love her deeply. He would shower her with presents occasionally. On Le birthday , Yi does not give any Le any birthday presents. Le was upset at that time. He heard from Yi's friend that she will be giving Le presents but in the end it was just for air. Le was very understanding. He thought that Yi might be having some cash flow problems as both of them are teenagers. On that day , although Yi had nothing for Le , he was still happy when his good friends help him celebrated and others wishing him.  Since then , Yi's friends will to say to Le that Yi is not treating him as her stead. But Le didn't mind at all. Le is still a happy boy with her.  Things start to crack. Le was calling her friends and asking why Yi didn't treat him so good like other couple do. Soon , more and more people were joining in the conference. Some encourage Le to break with Yi. On that night , Le break with Yi.  Yi was very upset as she don't know why Le break with her. Le was upset at that time too. So he decided to join gang to ease his suffering. Le still love Yi that time but just don't have guts to patch with her.  When Yi birthday was coming , Le decided to go to city hall saint andrew church to pick some ' love seeds ' and put it into a bottle and give to Yi on her birthday. On Yi birthday , he wrote some notes telling Yi how much he still love her and he wanted to patch with Yi. He stuff the notes into the bottle of ' love seeds ' and told Yi's friend to give it to her as he got no guts to give.  Despite how hard Le pick the seeds , Yi refuse to patch with Le and she had stead with another guy call Yuan.         After around 1 year , when they were both secondary 3 in the same class. Le got news that Yuan break with Yi. Yuan and Yi were together for 9 months. Le wanted to patch with Yi.  To be continued..."
ndf,Hello~ Welcome to my blog! I have a way interesting life so tune in later when I actually post something!
ndf,"Well, welcome to my blog, we'll see if this lasts long or not. I've just been sitting in my house in the dark all by myself today and thought if I did this maybe someone would care what I thought. If you recognize the title congratulations to you, you've probably got alot better idea of who I am then most. I've done things like this before and have been told I'm ""fucking hillarious"" so we'll see. Today I'm not feeling very comical just feeling alone and bored. Anyway that's about it for now if you want to know more, just ask."
ndf,"OMG! Today was like so incredibly great! Abie came home with me from school to go and see Awkward Romance performs. (They are like the greatest Christian band, ever! ROCK ON!) Well all I have to say about this afternoon before church is that I’m gonna need to start wearing chapstick like all the time now . . . ::naughty grins:: I don’t like chapstick, but I think it’s worth it . . . Did I mention that I love Abie, yet? No? Well I did now. The concert was great and all, but I think her and me would have had a better time, if we had stayed home instead . . . oh well . . ."
ndf,"I mean, I *heart* marching band!  That reminds me of the cadaver book I read and it posed the thought of what if humanity still thought the spiritual center of the body was the liver.  It would be like ""I *liver sign* marching band!""."
ndf,"i just bought a home hiv test kit from drugstore.com.  actually two.  and a bottle of wet platinum (that's stuff's yummy.  makes any session of self-love feel like you're 14 again...  but maybe that's not a good thing.  hm...)  of course, i didn't really NEED two tests nor the lube, but man i'm a sucker for bargains and i saved a whopping three cents for spending fifteen times more than i intended to.  i'm a bargain shopping stud.  the package arrived yesterday at work but i didn't want to prepare my blood sample in a shared bathroom stall.  so i thought i'd do it after a rigorous game of bowling.  and you know how much bowling gets the heart pumping and the body ready for blood sample extraction!  you basically have to prick your finger on these little plastic apparati.  of course, i was too afraid of getting pricked, so i couldn't get enough blood out of my middle finger from the shallow wound i created.  so instead, i doubled the pain by additionally having to prick my ring finger to get enough blood to fill this circle on the sample collection card.  okay, okay.  it really wasn't that bad.  i've learned to type with eight fingers quite rapidly.  no, really.  it's a lot better than getting blood taken out of your arm.  that's for sure.  the last time they did that, the nurse bruised my arm and it hurt to masturbate.  i knew i should have given the nurse my left arm...  but i'm really one big fuck up.  i just got tested a month ago.  but since then, i fucked this guy bareback and then got hit by a flu that came out of nowhere.  and this guy i screwed apparently is allergic to latex and doesn't always have safer sex with his partners.  and did i mention i already have a boyfriend?  i can deal with fucking up my own life, but when i start affecting other people's lives, i totally feel like shit and deserve more than just a couple of pin pricks on two fingers.  i can't even be straight about it.  here i am recounting my home test kit experience with witty embellishments to hide the fact that i'm a complete failure.  i can't bargain shop, i can't prick a finger, i'm a cheat, and i can't even honestly post an anonymous blog.  but at least i saved three cents.  and got free shipping."
ndf,"i really dunno wad is wrong with me... normally i am rather heartless with no feelings or wad so ever... if the person offends or make me unhappy i usually wun bother and my usual respond will be    wadever       or       screw you    ... but now i am plagued by the worst feeling ever...    jealousy     ...    and i hate it... haiz got to remind myself not to let this ""thing"" take over me... haiz.... blah blah blah..."
ndf,"Someone finally told Dest how they really felt other than me, that makes me so incredibly happy! I’m not sure who said it, but Lydia had something to add to it. She said to Dest, “You’re a sweet girl, you just need to shut your fucking mouth!” Garrett, I’m sorry that I’m saying all this, but this is how I really feel. Dest made me sooo damn mad today; she was talking about how she hates when people talk bad about other people behind their bavks, but she was doing the same damn thing to Michelle. And Michelle is the last damn person I would stand up for, but Dest pissed me off sooo fucking bad! All I hate to say when I walked into the RamPage office was HYPOCRITE and Dod so completely agreed with me. I know I’m a hypocrite, but if I ever get as bad as Dest I hope someone tells me or knocks the hell out of me, one or the other!"
ndf,"Well tonight things finally came to a collapse. Erika has finally decided she can't try and hold on to what we have had going for over 3 years. After a long talk on the phone, and her broken down in tears, many kind words exchanged back and forth, a little bit of laughter now and then, but mostly silence, trying to decide what to say. She has decided to stick with Troy because he is there for her, since i live 8 hours away. My heart was broken, after 3 years of keeping it going. I will cherish the last time i saw her, only 3 weeks ago, driving 8 hours leaving at 1 in the morning on a spur of the moment to go see her because my parents were out of town. Spending a whole day, and night with her was the most amazing thing i have ever experienced. After cuddeling all night, and falling asleep, we woke up early in the morning, and both started getting closer. Eventually, we ended up making sweet love for the first time which is the most amazing thing i have ever experienced with her. Only a few hours later i had to go home. Then, tonight, i found out that the big pit i was feeling in my stomach the other night was true. This past weekend she went and did it with Troy....I cant explain how i felt. I know they were dating but i was shocked. We talked some more, trying to work things out, but you know it doesnt work out that great. Both said a few things we shouldnt. She wanted to try and get rid of our emotions for each other, she said all her stuff, then i asked her if she really wanted me to say how i felt, and she said yes. After a long time of me talking, she was shocked of how much i really felt for her because this was truely the first time i was able to tell her i dreamed, and wanted to marry her someday. But, i was too late. She is with troy for the past couple months, if only i could have told her sooner my true feelings, but i didnt; now i am too late to care for her, she said its over forever. Hopefully i will still be able to talk to her. Night ended with a long silence, i could hear her crying in the background, a long silence, and the line goes dead. I am dieing, and really need to talk to her, call once, twice, 5 times, 7 times, 4 voicemails later, i give up, give one last call to tell her sweet dreams and have a good day at school. Then i head to the gym to try and work off some of what this night has brought. I have decided to write down the Soap Opra we have had for the past 3 years......"
ndf,"i think i have a fairly violent and destructive nature, the other day i saw a work line of ants crossing this little path in my garden, you know all in a little line carrying leaves and other small pieces of debris to there nest.   so i decided- without conscious control or empirical decision making- to follow the line and find this magical nest of ants and well, to destroy them. its not as if im a child still so there was no real explorative adventure kiddy stuff, just the pleasure of destroying their city.  so i went to the garage- found a high pressure vacuum suction hose attachment and pressurised some diesel fuel into there home, i was quite surprised as about a gallon went in, along with a flaming book of matches- and i threw a bible in just for good measure- good kindling really, nice thin pages. anyway so this massive jet of fire shoots out and almost cooks me, and the most satisfying part was that NO ants came back out, i let the ones working in the chain across the path live just so they could go and tell the other colonies what had happened.  i was quite disturbed by the enjoyment i got out of the whole thing, but well the world is full of wierdo's that do a lot more worse stuff, so im ok, right?"
ndf,"i might have to go to the hospital and get the evil stupid injection on my arm....its not nice....:( i know its gonna break like three of my arms and the pain wont leave till i eat off all the arms...no, im not making sence.   yea and ive done pretty much nothing during the two weeks in japan, although i was going to have the best summer holiday ever, its the most boring summer holiday ive ever spent. its hot, it stinks. its hot, it sucks. its hot, it boers me. so its not nice.  i think im forgeting my english and its also not gooooood cuz i have to go back to school at the end of august and im supposed to be able to speak english like mad and get good grades on the work i do in english....oh well, ill say to my mom that i want to move to ESL so i can be with those stupid freaks from japan who think they are good at english and i actually can kill both of them...oops. the topic has kinda changed and i cant be bothered to look back and think what i was talking about."
ndf,"i will start to go away     i want to say i am a free man now. i don't want to hurt anyone. specially not her coz i have hurt her a million times. as it is, i don't know if i am, i guess i am. but she's getting by. her pride and probably her resolve to make things work for her is getting her by. though i know deep inside she's hurting. because of me.  i know how i can make her really happy. but i just cannot do it now. most especially now that i have to clear out certain issues about myself.  i am contented to see her happy, no matter how contrived it is. i know she's not, deep inside she's not. but something tells me she's on her way there. she can make things work for herself. so i believe i am ready to leave her now for good. maybe slowly, i will drift away. and never bother her.  we'll finally have our separate lives. maybe once in a while i will check on her. i hope i can let her be. let her find her own peace. i will leave her for good."
ndf,"I was sitting at dinner with a few of my friends, and the conversation turned (as it often does) to the war in Iraq. WWI, WWII, Vietnam? It was always the young men who were sent out to fight. Young men like me.  I don't want to fight. I don't want to die.  Has the world lost its senses?"

ndf,"Its fun to the max, this whole writing on the computer thing. This way I don't have to freak out about my messy handwriting! Seeing as this is my first post, I am not going to take the time to voice opinions, share thoughts, examine beliefs, view ideas, yeah, you get the picture? The reason for that is because I am, well, first of all tired and second, I am...well, tired! There you go...I am just about having fun in the Lord and not having this whole pious, reverent aura about me, all the time. My God is one of crazy...in a sense. Hey now! Not crazy like...Terminator/Governor crazy, but a sense of him being just crazy for us and us being wild for him!    Shoot, I just voiced an opinion..."
ndf,Today started like anyother monday. I woke up crabby becuse I didnt get to sleep until about12:00. I know that doesnt seem late but I need about 9 hours of sleep in order to be in a good mood. When I got to school my I heard an announcement that we had to meet in the gym at fourth period to listen to our new vice principal ramble on and on about all the new rules. Then when I got to seventh period my class got in an argument with our teacher about how to organize our binders. After I got home I did my homework and then BBQed some hamburgers for dinner. Now I'm starting a blog for the first time.
ndf,"Starting sunday. I can't remember what i did but i guess it wasn't to important. Monday I Started going through my clothes and shoes to get rid of them. I have to send half of my clothes to my mom cuz i will be going to wyoming this week. and i don't wanna take all of my stuff, cuz i got to much. trust me. but other than that, i went to the store with my grandpa to get food then later that night, we went to wolly world (walmart) to get stuff for the pool cuz it's dirty. then today i started packing the stuff i will be bringing to wyoming. And now i am really bored so i guess i will end this here. well i will write another day, hopefully soon.    ~littlebear200~"
ndf,"Christ. This weekend kinda epitomised what my summer will be like. I don't think B wants to know me any longer, after no pickups and four calls... I don't think I'm on the top of peoples lists right now. When the others get on their school break, they're off to Poland which shall leave me here, back to square one. But, so I hope, when they return a real summer shall commence. [I can only keep my fingers crossed so much]. V gets back from work this evening, but I doubt I'll be seeing him if he gets back in the early hours. I guess next week will be spent in a coffee shop, drinking soft drinks and a cigarette in one hand - as per...  I don't know why I have such  great expectations of the Summer. I think it all stems from the Green days - when I was Mr. Popular. Well, so it seemed. Then that faded out and I was left with another lot of people...now im just hoping that doesn't fade out. I don't think it will.  But, there is a new prospect ahead of me, a'course. New school, new people, new faces, new opportunites blah x 3. Things are going to be new, and, perhaps my past will fade out, but there's something ahead afterwards. How mnelodramatic. Today, I shall do nothing. Its 2:25 pm and im in my duvet undressed at the pc. Dad's currently at the Tour de France in a smaller championship - we all pray he doesn't fall off a mountain. lol.   ...I had the sudden urge yesterday to watch willow. I must buy it.  P"
ndf,"Here I am trying to download anime all night in this government computer. Somehow I end up losing 4 download that night. These computer is slow and it takes like an hour each. You know how much time jts wasted trying to fix this problem. The whole time I was thinking only if I have my own computers. While I am mad at these computer something horrorable was happening out side the camp. 20 mile south of here is the town of Najaf. Those crazy people was acting up all week, threaten to blow up oil line and stuff. So the US marine when down their and kill 300 militia. They got us here alerted of possible counter attack. The trouble they case us just made me want to go down their to joint the fight. I just hate wearing body armor to walk around the camp."
ndf,"ANGEL        I don’t think much about it anymore, but there was a time I couldn’t get it out of my head.     It was a day I didn’t think I would survive, the metropolis of intuition that was vacuumed in my mind was endless.  I wanted to get it out and fast.  I hate myself when I am so inconsistent and incoherent.  I am in a state that cannot be reversed or understood.  I can’t remedy it.     Sex was never as good with her as it was in my mind.     There is nothing like cotton t-shirt sheets.     I feel creative but can’t understand why.  It’s been months since I have written.     The sunlight wakes me again, and I want to die.     I hear Massive Attack in my head…..the soft ambient noise in my mind that seems to always be there.  Angel, Angel, Angel.  I love that girls voice."
ndf,"I came to work today, checked my e-mail and there sitting in my inbox was an e-mail.  An e-mail from someone I went to High School with.  Someone I haven't spoken to in about 8 years.  I got that kind of panicky feeling before opening it. I always expect the worst.  Was she going to tell me about some unexpected tragedy that had befallen her or a mutual friend or even worse relate how wonderful her life has been since graduating.  Of course, it was the latter.  She's married, has a house, baby on the way, and has a great job.  Oh my Gawd, I can't breathe....  How can I compete with that? I'm still figuring out what to do with my life and right now I'm not even close.  I have a boyfriend and we've been together almost 4 years but we have no definite plans of getting married. And kids?  That isn't even a thought.  We are in escrow now for a house but every day feels like we are periously close to losing it due to my bad credit.   Since I was born every step of the way has be measured out.  1.  Graduate High School.  Okay, Check. 2. Graduate College. Mmmm, Check. 3. Get a job. Alright, Check. Alright, now what?  I did all that sooo..... I'm waiting........... what's the next step?   MarriageHouseChildDivorceRetirementDeath.   Great can't wait."

ndf,"I was at a wedding in NH this past weekend, and I can't help but wonder how many more weddings I will attend before I myself get married. I'm not dating anyone currently, but this getting married thing seems to be catching on like wild fire. Not that I am opposed to it. In fact, when I was in my last major relationship, I was pushing for it myself. But why? Did I think he was the one? Well, it did cross my mind, but I just saw him for the first time since we broke up on Sunday (after the Sat. wedding) and it is amazing to see how far we both are from that now. Does it make sense to get married when you don't know what you yourself want out of life? I'm starting to realize that the answer to that last question is 'no.' So, I don't think I am going to go looking for a husband any time soon, since I need to figure out my own path first.... but I must say, it is difficult to sit there by yourself and witness all the couples planning their weddings knowing how far off you might be. That must be a girl thing though!"
ndf,"In a few weeks I'm going to Minnesota. I love going there bc everybody loves me. They are family after all. So, this time I'm staying there for another week after the family leaves bc I have all that money. I'll edit this later. I'm too lazy. Love, Chloe"

ndf,"Today was an intresting day to say the least. Sometimes I wonder way the hell things are the way they are. I try to be a nice person but when you are nice, people will run the hell all over you. Today I had to turn in my best friend for getting a traffic ticket and giving the officer my name instead of hers. Did I just call her my best friend?........ With friends like that i'm set for life huh?. Well I bet she wont do it again. I guess I can cross her name off my Christmas list.    On another note my son had a good day in school today. I couldn't be more proud. I was so worried when he started school but I think that he will do fine.    As for my love life, thats not doing fine at all. I am intrested in someone but I just don't think he sees it, or me for that matter. I've done everything possible to get him to notice me.   Don't get me wrong we talk quite often but there is always people around. Hell maybe he just isn't intrested. I could see that as the problem. I'll keep hoping. I have nothing better to do........."

ndf,"Hello!  This is my first post on blogspot and the first day of school. My language arts teacher told us about blogspot and how we all might make one. So I decided to go ahead and get use to it.  I never liked the first day of school because everything is messed up. I didn't even know what bus I was suppose to get on. This morning they told me something completly different than what I was told this afternoon. Most of my teachers are nice, which is a good thing of course.  I finally met my neighbor today! She's a junior and I've already met her brothers. They're all really nice. But now I dont have to ride the bus alone, so, it's all good!  I can't wait until FCA (fellowship of christian athletes) starts again. It's always an amazing experience and it's awesome because you're worshipping in school!  I will try to remember to post on this everyday. I will post some artwork once i find out how."
ndf,"Im Tessa. Im 16 years old. My little boy Ian is now 11 1/2 months. Everyday I look at him and am just amazed by how big he's getting. my life has changed so much since I had him. I mean who could believe that just over 2 years ago I was on my way to being in the ""popular crowd"". I was Miss Suzy High School. I hated it and I hated me. Prentending that I loved cheer. Don't get me wrong cheer is great just not for me. I don't have the patcience or the determination to give up that much time to one lousy sport.   I hated pretending that I loved hanging out with my boyfriend. I gave up all my friends for him. I loved him but I definitly missed my friends. Critter was so controlling. Always telling me who, what, where, and when. He let all his friends just walk all over me.    But that's changed. I got pregnant at the young age of 14. Critter didn't want to believe it. I was making it up supposedly to get him not to break up with me. Ya right! I loved him but I'm not that pathetic. I was too scared to tell my parents. So I waited until I was 5 1/2 months along. Too far along to keep hiding it. I don't think I've ever seen my parents so mad. They were convinced that I couldn't handle a baby so I'd give him up to my parents. My mom can't have any more children and she's always wanted another. But i knew differant, I knew i could handle a baby. I fought over every little thing with them. I was so stupid about the true rights for teen parents. I believe my parents when they said that I had to do with that baby what they wanted me to. So I let them talk me into giving Ian my stepdad's last name. Ian Matthew Kubitza. Everyday since they talked me into it I've regreted it more than you can imagine.    One thing that I was right about was that I could handle a baby. I'm the one who deals with temper tantrums, dirty diapers and late nights.  Don't get me wrong, without my mom I never could have made it this far. My mom watches Ian when I go to school and when I work. I still go to school full time and I'm going to start nursing next year through a program in my HS. I can't wait. I also have a part time job now. Granted it isn't the best but hey it's something!    My life is definitly better. I don't hate myself or my group any more. I do the things in school that I want not what looks cool."
ndf,"Hello all. This is my blog. Instead of use it as just a play-by-play of my how my day went, I'll probably use it as a place to dump my opinions. This is my little corner of the internet, so to speak. And I'll use it to show the world my superiority. Because no matter what you say, I'm better than all of you.  *cough* Anyway....  So, yeah, I hope you all enjoy reading this. If you don't, oh well, it's obviously all your fault.  Well, I'll cya next post."
ndf,"So here I sit at work. Only three more hours left, I guess that's not so bad. It's over time so that makes it even better.    This online Blog idea was very clever. The user interface is very easy to use. I like it.    So when is it too soon to say I love you to someone? Or is there even a time limit on feelings and emotions. I don't think there is. I use to. I use to never believe in love at first sight. But just because you don't believe in something, doesn't mean it's not there. It's amazing how I use to think when someone would say, ""Oh you'll know when you've found the person you want to spend the rest of your life with."" I'd think to myself, how can that possibly be? How can you possibly know that just after meeting someone. Use to think it was all just movie talk, hollywood glamour to sell movies and merchandise. But I believe it now. I think deep down in my heart I had always wanted to believe it, but never wanted to get my hopes up for fear of being let down.    An Ex of mine use to get so aggrivated with me during our break up, cause he kept asking me if I see him in my future. I kept telling him I don't know. Because well, I don't. He kept asking if I had hopes for us to be together again, and I said, No. I don't have hopes for anything. Never have. It's better to have never hoped for anything, then to have been let down by those false hopes. But is it better to have loved and lost, then to have never loved? Going through the break up, I began thinking it's better to have never loved. But in recent events, I couldn't change my mind quick enough. I would rather have loved, and lost. The joy of being with that one person, and sharing moments and experiences that would never be the same, is priceless.    Well there is quite alot there to read. hehe I guess I should probably get some work done."

The mind has a thousand eyes, and the heart but one; yet the light of a whole life dies when it's love is done."

hello"
ff,"Did I do the right thing?
Hello,reddit.First of all,I want to begin this by saying that English isn't my first language,so please do forgive me if I make mistakes here and there.
Let's get straight to the point: I'm in highschool,10th grade.I've known my ''best friend'' since 1st grade.Y'know,it was that kind of nice,pleasant friendship,I was always there for her,she was always there for me,even travelling togheter,laughing with tears,told me many times that I'm her only ''true friend'' etc etc... and everything seemed to be alright...until she got a boyfriend. 
She started to ignore,even get mad me me as to why I don't text it first..well,why does it matter so much who texts first? Seems like a childish thinking in my opinion.I told her that I can't be the only person that talks in this friendship,so she told me she'll text me first.She never did,but I saw it coming anyway.
I realized that for her, it did not matter whether I am next to her or not.She is  so apathetic,almost to the point where it hurted me.But I decided to let go,focus more on myself,study more,read more,invest in my own hobbies and so on,so forth.As I was doing these,I started learning more things about myself,discovering things I didn't know about until now.And all of these happened,because I decided to leave her.She noticed this behaviour of mine and actually started talking to me,but it wouldn't matter anyway because it was an endless cycle.All she sees now is her boyfriend,I think the only reason she goes to school is just to see him,nothing else.
As I look back at our past [which is,kind of,sorta tragic and I don't want to into detail],I realized that I was the only one who truly cared.I always cried for her,I wonder if she cried for me,at least once?She blocked on me on our social medias for the stupidest reasons [She thought I was annoyed because she was talking too much about her boyfriend] and somehow I was but I didn't want to show it..but what did she accomplish by blocking me for almost a month,anyway? Couldn't she talk to me about it,at least? I told her in the most sincere way that I missed her very much through that period of time and even started worrying,crying in the middle of the night.Her response was short and dry,as usual.
I got fed up,starting to blame myself because I always accepted all of her bullshit.I broke our friendship,leaving her confused and perhaps angry at me. [I just started ignoring her and she noticed this].
Did I do the right thing? We haven't talked for almost 3-4 weeks."
ff,"I have never met or know what my real father looked like. That changed this week. Also I found out I have two more sisters.
So, my wife's family is really into ancestry and tracing lineage all the way back they can. Because of this, my wife really wanted to do 23andme and, being the good husband I try to be, I got her kits as a gift. Fast forward to Monday, the day I got my reports back. I'm scrolling through, ooo'ing and aww'ing at the things I didn't know, and then I go to their DNA relative section. Now, my wife had a few 3rd or 4th cousins who did the kit as well. Not me. I had one half sister listed. I was immediately stunned, because I only knew my real father's name and this girl had his last name. After sending a few messages, we find out that, yes in fact, she is my other half-sister (I have a half-brother and two other half-sisters)! Not only that, but I have two other half-sisters! 

My whole world was turned upside down this week. Prior to this, I had no interest in finding or knowing my real father. But, after seeing his picture for the first time and seeing how my sisters revere him. I am considering it. ON TOP OF THAT, this whole turn of events is like a Lifetime movie plot. Sadly he was in a car accident last week and was in critical condition. Even if I wanted to reach out, I don't think now is a good time. 

So, for now, I'm getting to know my new-found sisters and I'm very excited. We all want to meet up at some point!"
ff,"My mom wants to see me... naked?
Whew, so my parents moved to America from Korea and had my sister and I. They still stick to their homeland culture and tradition, but I've become accustomed to how things are done in America. Where kids have privacy and all.
My mom has been pestering me to see me naked. She says it's to size me to buy bras, but I don't think so.
She invades my personal privacy a lot, like butt slapping and I sometimes catch her staring at my privates. She comments on if I'm wearing a bra or not and I find it kind of creepy. I get that it may be normal in Korean culture, but I've asked her to stop since I feel uncomfortable. She said no, simply because she gave birth to me.
Whenever I'm changing, she barges into my room barely even a second after knocking and stares at me when I'm semi naked. I asked her for some privacy, after all, I'm almost 13, but she rejects it.
My mom made plans to go to a public bathhouse, but I told her I don't want to. She wants to drag me out and ""rub all the dead skin cells off my back"" but I feel like she only wants to see me naked.
She recently got breast implants and keeps bragging about how she increased in size, and how she's regaining her youth. I'm happy that she is, but now I feel like she's shaming me for being flat. Hello? I'm 12. She tells me about how much bigger she was in comparison to other girls back then, then shows my sister her cleavage. I asked my mom if breasts define a woman, you know how she replied? Yes. If you want to fit in, yes. If you want to be able to wear todays modern clothes, yes. If you want to attract men, yes. I honestly LIKE being flat, but my mom says I'll change my mind. I respect the fact that I may, but I'm still sort of annoyed.
I think she just wants to see me naked. Not as a parent, but as an inspector. I don't know if it's exactly normal in Asian culture, but I feel extremely uncomfortable. Any advice? Sorry if I sounded sorta whiney.
(Also, she sneaks into my room at night when she thinks I'm sleeping without a bra)"
ff,"My mom showed heavy favoritism to sister, and i deeply resent both of them.
So, i'm 20. I’m a pretty happy, go lucky person, but whenever i think back to my childhood i instantly get depressed and cannot function. This has been haunting me for years, and i'd love to get it out in the open. But, i would like it if someone could read this and tell me, if i have legit reason to be upset about this, or if i'm overreacting?


So, in my first 6 years, i was a normal, happy kid. I had a warm, happy family. My parents were just normal, i was a little spoiled, but when your the first born, that's kind of a given, right?


But that all changed when i was 5, my mom announced she was pregnant. with another baby. At first, i was happy, i knew what was happening, since i saw it on tv before. Mom still had time for me, of course that all changed when i was 6. I was in 1st grade when she was born. Until she was born, my parents spent literally all their time with me.


Here is when the bs started. .


So, to start was her actual birth itself. It was a saturday, mom went into labor. I was in my bedroom, playing a video game. Then, during the middle of my game, i heard tires squealing, i looked out my window and saw the family car speeding off. They forgot me, i at first thought they were rushing to the corner store, since mom had some bizarre cravings, mostly for their pizza. But hours went by, i started to worry, and after almost 6 HOURS, someone came to the house to get me (my grandmother). I was kind of peeved, but my dad promised to get me ice cream, so all was settled.


So, next was the sleeping arrangement. Every night, i slept right between my parents. I never slept alone, they tried to ween me, but i wasn't particularly fond of my bed. I liked sleeping with them, because it was warm, and i've always had this ""thing"", where i have to run my fingers through someone's hair before sleeping, i kind of grew out of it, forcefully.


How? Well, i never got to share a bed with mom again, me and my dad were regulated to the guest room. Mostly because i didn't sleep alone (i never started until i was about 12). Every night after that, my mom took my sister into my spot, she said she'd come get me to come in her bed after my sister fell asleep, but guess what? She never did. Not once did i sleep with mom ever again.


We later moved in with my grandma, who only had 2 rooms. I slept with mom and sis every night, and she always pryed and forced herself between me and mom.


Come to think of it, mom never really had time for me any more, i had to start taking the bus to school. since she had no babysitter, plus dad worked.


I kind of always prefered mom, to my dad. She was a lot more fun, and creative. She made me a marble box out of popsicle sticks once. But, she kind of pawned me off on my dad after the devil child was born.


Sadly, when i was 7, my parents divorced and me, my sister, and my mom lived with my grandma.


Now, when i was 9, i had gotten involved in 4-h. I had a talent for writing and giving speeches. So, it was a big deal for me. I was the best in my class, and even made it to county competition. One of only 5 kids in my school. It was my proudest moment, since i always sucked at sports.


So, we got to the place, there were 50 people listening to me give my speech, i had my little suit, and was very proud of myself. I practiced hours a day, i wanted to go to state as well. And as soon as i get to the podium, guess who starts crying. Loud enough that everyone can hear it. My sister. So, mom had to take her out. She never saw my speech. I gave it, but i just couldn't do it right, i was on the verge of crying myself from what happened. I was too upset that she was missing it, i got a ""Participant"" ribbon, my big moment was ruined. I was gonna do it again next year, but when i wrote my speech, i had no enthusiasm for the project, and it lacked the ""zing"" the previous one had, so i didn't advance very far. I honestly didn't care anymore, mom asked about it, I told her my sister would probably ruin it.


She started growing up, and became an even more entitled little tyrant. Here we start on her as a tween. She just got so much worse.


First of all, mom really only paid attention to her. She never came in my room to come visit, at all. That's a general example, here is a more specific list.


First of all, there was one time that my pants had a hole, the pocket ripped and my wallet fell out, and I never noticed until the next day. She found it, and instead of returning it, she took $100 out of it, then returned it the next day. Worst of all, she told mom to promise not to tell me that she took it, she bought a cell phone with it. I didn't even find out until almost 10 years later.


Anytime I would try to spend time with mom, she'd always come in. I never got alone time with my mom, without her rearing her head. That was if I even got to spend time with her at all. She'd promise to spend time with me, but I’d either wait forever, and I’d be too tired to do anything. Or, she'd never show up at all.


One time, it was about 8, I asked if she wanted to play Tetris. She said she'd love to, in a few minutes. So, I loaded up Tetris, paused it and waited. Keep in mind, I couldn't really do anything else. It was nearly 2 and a half hours. She never showed, so I went to bed, I could hardly hold my eyes open. She finally did show, she got mad and said ""I thought you wanted to play?"" But, I told her ""I couldn't wait forever.""


Her excuse was that she had to wait for my sister to go to bed, because I’d get mad if she came to play too. Instead of saying ""No, I want some quality time with my son"", she just waited till absurd hours of the night, knowing I’d be too tired to play.


That was how it was any time I wanted to play with mom.


Minor story, I got a bop it toy for Christmas. She asked to borrow it and take it to school, she had to write her name on it so if it got lost, the school would know who it belonged too. She never gave it back, and about 2 weeks, her and mom were playing with it, I asked if I could have it back, and she said it was hers. I never saw it again.


One time, she broke my tv. She got the day off from school, faking being sick (I’ll get to that in a moment). While at school, she lounged around my room all day, and somehow broke my tv. I have no clue how, but it's just when I got home it was broken. She never got yelled at or punished whatsoever.


The time I got the flu. All night I had been chilled, shivering, and sick. I felt awful, I told my grandma, and she let me take the day off and would take to the doctor's office that day.


That morning, I got yelled at, accused for playing hooky. I got took to the doctor, and guess what? I was diagnosed with the flu. Mom changed her tone, and acted nice and as if she was worried the whole time. I got guilted for needing to miss a week. Then the next day, guess who got the flu? My sister.


So, she got tested. Guess what, no flu. She acted sick all morning, but as soon as mom told her she could miss school, 2 hours later, she was riding her bike and doing cart wheels in the yard. No yelling, no punishment


One time she threw my 80's, rare wrestling figures into a muddy ditch, ruining the paint job. Nothing.


There was one birthday, she got $100, my birthday came, only 75.


You know, around this time I started to watch lots of anime. I pretended I was in their worlds, it always brought me happiness. I tried to get my mom interested, but she never did. Then, one weekend, I asked her to play Mario with me, like the good old days. But, my sister showed up, with a Dragon Ball Z DVD, battle of gods movie. She asked if I wanted to watch it, I said no because I’ve seen that movie 10 times already. Mom got mad at me, and watched it with her. For 5 years I’ve been begging her to watch it with me, but she never could. I sat and watched it with them, because she said if I did, she'd play with me. She sat through the whole movie with her. So, after waiting over an hour for her to play with me. She finally showed, played one level, and went to bed because she was too tired. We'd play in the morning she said, that morning never came.


Then, my graduation. Around this time, she moved in with our dad. They all came to my graduation, but she mostly talked to her the whole time, begging her to come visit.


Also, funnily enough, I never got told congratulations or anything for graduation. She never posted how proud she was of me on Facebook, or anything. But, that same year, my sister made the honor roll. I never heard the end of it.


So, recently, last year I got an injury. and that brought on a whole slew of crap.


Most of these involve me wanting privacy for my problems and her showing up when not wanted.


First, was physical therapy. She just had to come, without even asking me, mom said yes. I told her no, I didn't want her to go. We had a huge fight, and we didn't go.


Then, was a checkup. I didn't want her to come, but she did anyway. There was no reason for her to go, they just sat in the lobby. This was a very personal thing, and I wanted as few people there as possible.


I remember mom wheeled me in, (I was in a wheelchair), and sis said she'd wait in our car. Nope, guess who walked in. Mom largely ignored me at my own appointment. Therapy and Doctor's appointments were the only time we really got together.


Then, another time I asked her to play a game with me. She actually did, then in 5 minutes, guess who called out. My sister, mom just disappeared, and never came back, so I just turned it off.


And finally, the most recent example. I actually planned on moving out. I needed a 10-dollar box. I begged and asked for weeks, and it took seemingly forever to buy me that box, but my sister asked for a 300-dollar dress, and she got it bought for her in less than a day."
ff,"Why did my sister commit suicide on October 28th, 2017, three months ago today?
She was beautiful.  She was successful in business.  She gave the ultimate wisdom and advice.  She knew what love was.  She traveled the globe.  She gave back.  She was selfless.  Why did she do it?  How was she able to jump from so high up?"

ff,"Should I have kids?
Here’s why I’m asking:
My mother has an undiagnosed mental illness, of that I am certain. My best guess is either bipolar or borderline personality disorder. Growing up with her was difficult and she never got the help she needed. My brother and I suffered greatly as a result. The scariest thing is when I occasionally find, or think I find, her mental illness in myself.. certain tendencies to obsess, feel abandonment that isn’t real and lashing out because of it, etc. When that happens I just feel so disgusting and shameful. In those moments I wish that she wasn’t my mom and that I wasn’t her son, or that I could permanently swap heads with someone else.

I think about all this as my fiancé and I talk about having kids. Both of us are ready and we want to be parents so very badly, though I haven’t brought up my fears to her. I worry often about passing on that illness to our children. My fiancé doesn’t deserve that, she shouldn’t have to face those hard challenges. I love her so much and the thought of doing that to her kills me inside. I feel so much shame around wanting to be a parent because of this that I wonder if I should be one at all, or rather, a biological one.  It’s something I’ve never really thought about before now and I don’t know what to do. Please help"
ff,"What is a functional family?
I know what a dysfunctional family is and I have plenty of experiences from my formative years to share with y’all but, I am not going to regale you with a “woe is me” diatribe.  That’s not my objective today.

My objective is to seek positive experiences to better understand the foundational attributes of a functional family.  I believe, in fact, I know these families exist based on my South American experiences from an entire society but, what about North America? Families are families no matter the country you live in but, is the lack of family attributes / cohesion as a collective whole uniquely North American for many of us but, not all? 

In short, let’s dig in to uncover some of these positive family attributes in my next post and I look forward to reading your responses."

ff,"How do I get over a friendship?
Hi all,
I have gotten over people in the past... but having trouble here.  The problem is that they treat all their other friends so good - but not me.  So, it just hurts even more to get over this (I am the one ending the friendship because of how they treat me).  I think I could get over it, if they were just a jerk or a bad friend - but they're not.  They're just a bad friend to me.  Any advice would be so helpful just to read and know maybe I'm not alone with the kind of pain."
ff,"I know I'm overreacting but I need to vent
So there is this girl I've been friends with for three years. Right now she is almost done with college but I still have to take some courses so we don't see each other that often. That's why she told me two weeks ago we should meet up. I told her to pick out the day which suit her best. She said Monday and I agreed. Turns out my mum needed money so I have almost nothing on me and because of that I told her I could hang out but couldn't go to the restaurant she said we should try. She replied that she ""couldn't make it tomorrow"" (today) and I thought wth?! you said Monday? It was you the one who said Monday not me... Anyway she said let's meet up on Wednesday and I said ok but tbh I don't feel like going out whatsoever. She was sorry because, and I quote, ""I thought we were going to meet today"" and I'm like dafuq. She, all of a sudden, forgot about it?! Does it make any sense? I guess she made plans with other people or whatever but fuck it, don't say one thing and then act like you didn't even say anything. I know I'm overreacting here but I'm so fucking tired of people and their ""you're my best friend"" and ""I love you, I care about you"" shit. The thing is I guess I'm pretty pissed off because I've always struggled to make friends but even when I have they don't give a shit. I'm so tired. Honestly, fuck everyone."
ff,"Susceptible Younger Sibling
I have a sexually active younger sibling who severely lacks proper sex education. She will not confide in me, our parents or any family for that matter (she’s afraid that my extended family and myself will snitch to our highly-religious parents, who are against premarital sex), but casually revealed her ""activities” to our hairdresser who felt uneasy by what she had heard. With that said, the hairdresser informed me of what was said, fearing that my sister may be in danger of herself. 

Situation: 

My sister's partaking in sexual relations with her boyfriends (yes, boyfriends since they change every few weeks) WITHOUT protection. She has very low self-esteem, and goes for guys with “nothing going for them” (i.e. no job, no education, drug-dealing/taking, etc.). But what triggered my hairdresser (whose primary concern is SAFE sex) to contact me was the fact that her current boyfriend is uncircumcised, does not use protection and has convinced my sister that “pulling out” is safe sex—revealing their lack of adequate sex education. Furthermore, my sister has complained (to me/our parents) of yeast infections and UTI’s, checking in-and-out of the clinic on several occasions, but casually dismisses it as wearing too-tight skinny jeans. And while my mother is comfortably in-denial and takes everything my sister says for face value, my father and I have had our suspicions about what may really be going on for awhile now.

Some background information:

- Sister comes from an upper income family 
- Youngest of 3, very spoiled
- Fast-tailed, boy-obsessed, hates being single
- (Barely) of legal age (technically “grown”, but not independent, so she lives with our parents who expects her to live by their rules until she moves out).
- Was brought up Christian
- Strong preference for men from poverty-stricken/rougher backgrounds and engage in illegal activities (I suspect she thinks it’s edgy?)
- Has a job, but devotes every last penny either uber-ing/lyft-ing to be with her (job-less) boyfriends or loaning them money
- Loving immediate/extended family
- Very manipulative, yet extremely impressionable when it comes to guys
- Current boyfriend is from overseas, deals/does cocaine (and pressures her to join in), jobless, without education, ill-tempered, manipulative and violent. Also his parents are entirely against their relationship due to her being of a different race/ethnicity than him. 
- Previous boyfriend was also ill-tempered, manipulative and violent, but also physically/verbally abusive, dealt weed, had no job/HS drop-out and made a “runaway” attempt with my sister which was prevented after I “snitched” to my parents (hence the reason she no longer confides in me, but I felt it was necessary given the severity of the situation). Cops were even involved. 

My parents have attempted to send her to a prestigious out-of-state college to get her mind off of guys and focus on her studies, however she shows very little interest in education, let alone bettering herself in any form or fashion. She “lives in the now” and has a very blinkered outlook on life.

With everything said, I would like advice on how to handle the situation (i.e. what to do with the information). Should I relay it to our parents and risk “rattling” on my hairdresser (i.e. the source/proof in which my parents will ask for)? Should I mind my business and risk my sister catching something more severe/getting pregnant/etc.? Not to mention her current boyfriend's gang/violent/drug-related background could potentially put our family at risk (she's revealed our location/faces via social media and casual talk--entirely against our wishes) should they ever break up or anything of the sort (we had to place a restraining order on her last violent boyfriend). I have a very strong conscience and do not believe that I could live with myself should the latter happen. 

Sorry for the novel, but I wanted to expound as much as possible to give an accurate reporting of the situation at hand. I have always been over-protective over family (my little sister especially), and it breaks my heart to see her follow such a destructive path. Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.

Thank you."

ff,"Is My Friend A Bad Friend?
I have a friend. When I moved to a foreign country, I went to a school and met this friend. We have been quite close but after I moved back to my country, we’ve only been communicating through texts. She has been a helpful friend but I don’t know if she is a good friend or a bad friend. 

There were many occasions when I wondered if I should break friends with her, but I always told myself that she didn’t mean to ever hurt me and I kept on trying my best to act like nothing was wrong and acted friendly. But I srsly can’t hold it in and I wanna know if I’m just being sensitive.. 

These are some of the things she does that makes me wonder if we should break friends..

1.We use eachother’s selfies as our profile pics and I always use the best selfies of hers or at least what I think are the best looking ones. And I sent her a video if me singing with my other friend and she took a screenshot in the middle of the video and used it as her profile pic and My mouth was wide open and my eyes were scrunched up and it really looked horrible and when I asked her to change it, she asked what I meant and that it didnt look bad. 

Sure she couldve been being nice and I could’ve been acting emotional but I really didn’t like other people who I didn’t even know seeing a photo like this so I pleaded her to change it but I tried to keep the joking and friendly mood. However then she said “Funny. U wouldn’t wanna see the other screenshot I took.” And we both didn’t say anything. And she didn’t change it. 

2.The way she texts me depends on her mood. If she isn’t feeling friendly, she barely answers my texts and replies with short answers and doesn’t laugh at anything funny I have to say.

 I wondered if I could also be acting like that at times but I looked back at our conversations and ai never let my mood change the way I replied to her, and I honestly didn’t even speak in an unfriendly way when she said something rude to me or something that made me feel offended.

3.She doesn’t act like she cares for what I have to say. Whenever something bad happens to me and I tell her, she just gives a small reaction and talks about something else.

4.She ignores my texts. There was once a time when she saw my texts and didnt reply. I asked why she didn’t reply and she saw it but ignored it. I thought that maybe she had something important going on so I just kept on texting her every few hours like nothing was wrong cuz I don’t exactly like showing others when I feel hurt. 

She read my texts and ignored me for two whole days and finally texted me back as if nothing had happened. She didn’t apologize for not replying nor did she give an explanation. She just texted me about something else she wanted to say. There were lots of cases like this.

5.She acts like she has the worst life. I go through alot of stress each day cuz I have had family troubles and sometimes had been bullied. I have also often had suicidal thoughts. 

However whenever I tell her about things that are stressing me out, she points out that her life is worse. I understand that she has her own troubles but I really dont like the way she underestimates my life and doesn’t care for it.

6.She once cyber bullied me. When I left her school and left the country, we had a small fight and she told her friends about the bad things I had once said, not mentioning her faults. She then invited me to a group chat with lots of people and they all fought against me, calling me fat,ugly,short,stupid,and dumb. They also made racial comments and insulted my mom. 

After a year passed, I texted her. I can’t believe I did it, but I said that I WAS SORRY. And she said that she forgave me and now we’re talking like friends again. 

But whenever I bring up a little detail from the past, she gets mad and says that I am blaming her for the past and makes me feel guilty for something I shouldn’t be guilty about.

7.She thinks that she is perfectly innocent. I’m not saying shes a totally horrible person, she can be a good friend at times, but I gotta admit that at times she can be horrid.. 
And whenever something bad happens to her, she says that she doesn’t get what she did to deserve it and that she is getting mistreated. 

If you think about it that way, I feel like I also deserve this, considering Im not a saint or an angel. But whenever my friend says that she didnt do anything bad to deserve some bad things that happened to her, I can’t help but feel disappointed at the fact that she doesn’t realize  how much she hurted me

What should I do..? Am I just being sensitive..?"
ff,"im lost without her but I don't know what to do
So me and my best friend of about 7 years stopped talking and being friends essentially, around a year ago. We had been fighting a bit before and it kind of led up to this.

So what kind of started it off was the fact she got a new boyfriend who was and I swear still is, the biggest jerk of all time. I can see now that it probably wasn't my place to tell her that but I was only looking out for her and she used to appreciate advice like that from me in the past. 

Then she started pretty much ditching me for him and taking his side and telling him things that were private and I felt like she was slowly kicking me out and replacing me. And I told her that, but she didn't see it because she had her new guy and it was kind of like she didn't care because she had someone there for her.

She also lost a couple other friends before this happened pretty much due to the same reasons so I didn't feel that bad at first because I was kind of like you know ""she did this to herself, she made this choice"". But now, I really miss her and I hate that we stopped being friends because I kind of need her.

Im not sure what to do. She did actually text me about a month after we stopped talking and was like ""hey, I know we don't talk anymore but I wanted to see how you are going"" and I actually ignored it because I was angry and didn't care but now I kind of see it was a bitch move. And I don't know how to text her or talk again because its awkward and she's still with this guy and I'm pretty sure he hates me and I juts don't know how to handle it. But I really want to make this right again.

Any help would be really appreciated :)"
ff,"My husband is not my best friend. Friends jealous of friends.
My husband isn’t my best friend and that’s ok. In fact, it’s more than ok. Yes, he is my friend but our connection is deeper than that. We are building our lives as one. Sharing our day to day, filling them with constant support and security. I love my husband deeply but we are also different people. He plays video games and I do arts and crafts. He watches war movies and I go to brunch. I value my friendships & consider them a priority in a different light than the priority my spousal relationship takes. Because of our many differences, I take and make the time to build on my friendships. If their partners are their best friends, I am truly so happy for them. What a beautiful thing to find.

  However, I tend to notice that those are the friends that often get jealous of my other friendships or the plans I make with others. I hope that I make it clear how much they mean to me because that is all I can do. I don’t have a live-in best friend. I don’t spend all of my hours or all of my days with my partner. I have different people in my life for different reasons. I love them all. I think my biggest insecurity/worry is that feeling that I’m sometimes expected to put my life, needs or other friendships on hold while those with “partner bffs” hang out with their bffs. Not everyone can understand, so I have to teach myself to let go of the guilt. Truthfully though I just reaaaaallly wish my friends with bff partners could understand so they’d stop getting jealous. They want me to be and still call me their best friend but they already have one. We were “best friends” till they found their partners and I harbor zero resentment for that, all I want is happiness for all of us. Sure you can have more than one best friend, but I simply don’t take their priority anymore.  But so I have to move on, ya know? I keep in touch and try to maintain our friendship but when I get closer to a different friend it angers them in a way. If I make plans for a trip with a different friend I am ridden with guilt. Do I just tell myself to get over it? I’m doing my best? I know there’s nothing but love on my part. So it’s not truly my problem, right? (Easier said than done with that mindset though)

TLDR: my friends boyfriends/fiancés are their best friends. They get jealous of me getting close with or making plans with other friends while theyhangs with their bff partners. Not my fault right?"
ff,"{Experience} Angry Sibling
I have a sister who will tell you she's the most laid-back of us all, but the truth is her anger will zoom from zero to 10 in the blink of an eye.  When we converse she will criticize or take exception with something I've said and I have to gently remind her that I'm only telling her how I *feel*; I'm not disagreeing with her opinion, or whatever.

Thing is, it's getting more and more difficult to talk with her as it seems as though *ANYTHING* sets her off these days!  And while I've nothing at all against Bill Burr - I actually think he's hilarous! - talking to her is like trying to talk back to one of his on-stage rants, understand?!  Because he's ranting to be funny, but she actually means what she says.

I love this sister, and am closer to her than many of the five sisters I have, but I'm beginning to point this out to her because I don't think she realizes the way she sounds.  Almost everything is said in a confrontational or defensive tone of voice!?!?!  And I just don't understand *WHY?*  Should I suggest therapy?  Anti-depressants, or anti-psychotics?  A shrink?"

ff,"My Father and Step-Mother sound like they will be getting a divorce.
I have three half siblings whom I'm relatively close to, two of them are teenagers and still under their parents' care. Anyways long story short it's my father's consumption of alcohol that's causing the damage. He does well for awhile then doesn't and it's been going on like this for years. Unfortunately my father and I aren't that close. It almost feels like we're walking acquaintances inside the same home when we have dinner together as a family. He seems distant to everyone in our family as well, it can be hard for him to open up. I think my father is really depressed, but he refuses to see a therapist or anything like that.  He may be going through some sort of (late) midlife crises right now. He still works his job and apparently brings home enough money to support his family. My step-mother took me aside and looked worried about her situation. She expressed that she may need to get legal help, and is concerned about protecting her children. At this point, I'm going to try and open up to my Dad and just point blank ask him what's going on with his life? He's about to lose his wife of 25+ years and hit a hard rock bottom. I hate to see him do this as he's been a pretty good Dad overall, and always provided for his family... at least keeping our heads above water financially. Any thoughts about how to approach alcohol use and possibly getting a stubborn old man to seek help? I know it's gotta be on his terms and everything, but I don't know what else to do. Thanks!"
ff,"Weird Dreams
So I have this issue I keep dreaming about sexual relations with my Sister in Law. Trust me when I say I love my wife and actually consider her sister to be a good friend and almost like a sister. Although these last couple of dreams I've  dreamt my Sister in law naked or us doing things and I feel weird when I wake up after. Now yes she is an attractive woman but I don't see her that way at all. Does this make me a bad Husband or is there some scientific thing behind this???? Please help cause I can't even talk to her sister without feeling weird or remembering her naked. Also which I've never seen her naked at all in case that becomes a question."
ff,"How does it feel to have an abnormal next of kin?
I have a brother who people call ""retarded"". But actually he's not. Just family - the one voluntarily has patience with him understand that. 
When I was a kid, I only thought he had some illusions about life because he had always talking about unreal things. We were watching TV and the editors were discussing some news, instead of listening and talking about related topics (as normal people do) he started to shout that they were stupid and made up his own story that us all knew it told no true information. If it's your family's case, maybe your parents would try to talk to him or do something, but mine did nothing. When I argued with him over such false information, my parents even stopped me and said ""Why do you have to argue with your poor brother?"" I thought they would never tell him what's wrong and what's right. 
At age of 10, once he told me to pack things up 'cause we would go for a trip with my mom's friends, I had no doubt and did exactly what he had said. Of course, one day later I found out he lied. At that moment, he looked at me with his wicked eyes and laughed. That's the moment I realized he's such an attention seeker, he's selfish and just wanted the world to turn around himself. Since then, my parents never listen to me as I say he's not a fool, he's slippery even. And others saying I was blessed because all the bad luck on his place so I could live, study and be the only child that parents could be proud of. 
He's been living an easy life 'cause people are working their asses off out there but he just needs to call mom and things will be done. And none would want to resent him making mistakes 'cause ""he's retarded, just leave him"" they say. I envy him. Should I be stupid in order to be noticed by my parents?"
ff,"not invited to friends party, yet others who barely know her were?
so, i wasn't invited to my close friend's party, yet i've known her for 3-4 years. countless people who don't talk to her were invited and so she can't use the excuse of that she had 'limited room/invitations.' also she mentioned to one of my friends, who was invited, that she had sent me an invitation (via text) yet I didn't respond. when it seems as if the text didn't 'go through.' but the fishy thing is that she even made a groupchat. how could a text not go through and how could she forget to add me to a groupchat? 
I'm just upset and I'm not sure what I did wrong.
I don't want to confront her because either she'll get upset, or she'll just say 'it was a mistake.' yet somehow i don't believe it was and I want to know what I did wrong."
ff,"Mom treats me like a stray cat and siblings like gold
My younger brother and sister are 10/11 years younger than I am. We have an older brother but he no longer speaks to our mother and has t for about 5 years. I’m an adult now and I fully support myself and have since I was 18. As soon as I graduated high school and child support stopped, I was tossed out of my moms with nothing but garbage bags filled with my clothes. I was told I had to live with father even tho my mother had just bought a house with her husband and my youngest siblings. My stepfather never like me and always kept me separate from their family. They would go to dinner every Friday night and I had to stay home bc he would flip out and many other mean things. To my step dad, I was a stray cat who didn’t belong near his children. My mother never stuck up for me and stayed with him until I was in my mid 20s when he cheated on her and left her. I was raised dysfunctional but bc of that I long for a close, supportive family. Once he was out of the picture, I was able to create relationships with my sister and brother. My siblings are now in their late teens and I’m 26. I’ve struggled immensely on my own I had no choice. I could have 3 dollars to my name and my mother wiuld take it from me for coffee etc. if she picked anything up for me I had to give her the money ASAP. Soon as child support stopped, legit the day I graduated i had to live with my dad and mother gave me only garbage bags with clothes.  good. Anything that had been mine was now my sisters (bedroom set, jewelry stand, American girl dolls list goes on. Now years later, my mother makes sure my brother and sister have everything and anything the very best of. Designer everything, newest clothes shoes, technology. When it comes to me, my mother doesn’t do anything at all. If she buys the coffee I am to give her to $2 but reversed she would die if I asked for the money back for he coffee. Now foremost, I’m fully aware I am an adult and can support myself. It has nothing to do with what my mother does for siblings it’s how she treats me compared to her treatment of siblings. For instance, I asked to use sisters perfumes that smelled good and was told no it’s her expensive kind. I’m not to use anything of my brother or sisters actually. My brother s d sister themselves do not care about this stuff it’s just my mom. When cleaning my face, my younger brother is allowed to use my sisters face cream or anything really bc well they are siblings. But i am not allowed to use the very same thing. If my mother is getting rid of things she will charge me full price. If she orders pizza and I eat a couple pieces I have to pay her half the money. Point I’m getting at is that she treats me like im not good enough to use my sister expensive designer perfume or face wash etc. she can buy the best of the best for them but charges me if I need anything. Holidays she spends thousands on them and if she does anything for me she only gives me gift she receives for free for spending so much as PINK etc .im not expecting to be equal. Again I’m an adult and can buy myself things but she can’t spend even $25 on a gas card or something lol I should add that it is expected of me to get her and siblings expensive gifts for their bdays and Xmas. Moms bday is in January if I happen to be broke and can only afford a $25 dunkin card, my bday in February she will get me something small or a $5 dunkin card. If I can’t afford a gift, she makes damn sure my bday co es and goes without her buying bday gift. Immature or not I’m very hurt by this. I was always a good kid, never in trouble, finished high school, went to some college and never asked for hand outs. Why am I not worth two small sprays of designer perfume??"

Getting to Know a Stranger! 
A Human Thesis w/ a Photography Minor

Getting to Know a Stranger is a human project looking to get to know someones life by giving an hour (I always encourage it to go longer) to Getting to Know Stranger that other wise I would have never met. There is no monetary exchange only one of friendship and kindness. I would like to document our meeting with a few candid photos only if you are comfortable, if not, a conversation does the trick! 

Getting to Know a Stranger is all inclusive and strives to get to know all walks of life. I welcome all ages, gender identities, races, religious views, economic status.…. you know every type of Human! 

I know that in my own life I have felt extremely alone and isolated in my own mind many times, and have felt that there is NO one who understands what I am going through. What I started to notice was through my own travels and tribulations I have noticed one thing, we are all a lot a alike, and most of the time share a more relatable story then anyone in my inner circle. In todays technology the human interaction is becoming less and less human and more and more digitized. Screen watching instead of people watching, direct messaging instead of a hand written letter are methods of detachment driving a wedge between our true selves and the human being sitting across from us.

So how do I make a change in my own life toward fighting this black hole of being digitally programmed, force fed fear, and made too wallow in my insecurities. Get out there and meet people of walks of life and commit an hour of my time each day to an individual who could use a human interaction. 

A little about me!      
My name is Aaron Bistrin I am a 28 year old guy from Santa Cruz California, a beautiful place to grow up. However it wasn't always easy growing, Santa Cruz can be a tricky place to navigate as youth and I found myself in quite a bit of trouble very young. 
This continued into my early 20’s and after a series of life changing events I started to make some serious changes in my life. As one positive lead to another, I found myself opening a restaurant in my home town at the age of 25. Fast forward a few years and I have found myself out of the restaurant industry and creating an alternative marketing company with my best friend. This is where I found my love for photography and content creation. My passion for human interaction and learning about people has been inherit nature since I was a child. I feel when meeting strangers our filters are down, there are no pre programmed family/community paradigms, is this not the best opportunity to be your true self? So what better than combine my two passions of photography and human interaction into a Human Thesis with a Photography Minor. Getting to Know a Stranger. 

If you or someone you know could use a kind interaction by Getting to Know a Stranger, please comment below or shoot me an email at abistrin@yahoo.com. All meeting are private unless the consent from both people is given. This is a project of human kindness. Hope to meet you soon!

Much love!

ff,"My Best Friend Feels More Like My Daughter
I love my best friend like family and if anything were to happen to her, you can know I'd be there in an instant. But I feel awful admitting that I really don't like spending time with her anymore.

We're both in our late twenties and I'm sort of the only family she has since she severed ties with her parents (a choice I completely agree was for the best). We've been best friends for the past decade and I've seen her through some really difficult times.

She's faced a lot of struggles, mostly stemming from the terrible relationship she had with her family and the financial burden separating from them put on her life. Unfortunately, many of those struggles are ongoing and have really dominated our friendship. We spend more time talking about her problems than we do hanging out.

I've gotten up at 3:00am to talk with her on the phone because she had a nightmare and she's scared. I've left my job early to go help her because she left hers early in tears. Days that are supposed to be fun (a movie, a game night, making dinner together) end up with me supporting her because she's upset about something, and suddenly the whole evening is gone. I don't want to exaggerate, but I'd say 70% of the times I see her I have to go into ""support mode.""

And unfortunately, I've realized that I don't enjoy her as a friend and I honestly don't think I ever will again. The dynamic of our friendship has changed and it's never going to be what it was. Don't get me wrong, I care deeply for her and want to be there for her if she needs me, but the fact of that matter is I've found myself not reaching out to her anymore because it's just not a pleasant experience. When we do hang out, it's not because I want to; it's because I feel that's what she needs. She's a burden. She's a burden I bear willingly. But she's a burden.

I don't know what to do. I really wish there were an easy way to say ""I don't like you anymore, so please don't be hurt that I don't reach out, but god you don't know how much I care about you."""
ff,"Brother rage attack my grandmother
My brother is prone to rage attacks. Him and I had that classic ""brother love"" growing up. Anyways this isn't about me it's about my grandmother. 

So my grandma from my mom's side came from out of the country to live with us for a couple months (my brother and I still live with our mom). To help with housework and see our family. 

She is the one of the sweetest ladies out there. Typical caring loving person, very sensitive and full of love & happiness. Now my brother comes into the equation... he's had his rage bursts with me  and I've learned to deal with it as well as my mother. They say how you treat your mom is how you treat your wife. 
Honestly, he's so disrespectful to my mom at times it makes me vehement. What can I do come in and save the day (when I have done in the past it only made things worse). 

Anyways, I thought I knew my brother well and knew he wouldn't dare yell at my grandma. OMG boy was I wrong he crossed that line. A rage attack came at my grandma with yelling and this time I did intervene. 

After things settled I consoled my grandma she was shocked, sad, unable to believe he was like this. So I told her the truth he has always been like this and I feel just as much pain as she felt becuase seeing her distraught was one of the most depressing things I have ever witnessed. She wants to leave and go back although I can tell she is worried for me & my mom. 

Hate to break the news baba but ya he's a fucking entitled narcisstic pieces of shit on the planet. I understand when guys  blow steam with other guys but seriously to your own mother and grandmother. I think it's completely unacceptable and disrespectful. 

Note: our dad is not involved because he doesnt live with us or see us often

I left a lot of details however, you understand the picture. 


Question: He will not change, I think as a family we should distance ourselves from him carefully. Yes or No?"
ff,"Best friend drifting away?
I've debated whether to post this or not for ages. My best friend is like my sister and has been there for me through really hard times, and I've been there for her. We're similar in so many ways, run a small blog together and I love her to bits. On new years eve she was set up with a guy and they've been dating ever since. Since their first date, we hardly talk. She doesn't even want to talk about him much, and when she does she talks about quitting her job for him, and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. They go out drinking a lot, almost every night, it seems like he spoils her and she's told me she's really happy. 
But at the same time her anxiety is still bad. She's lost her ambition to travel, adventure and take up new hobbies. She doesn't contribute to the blog anymore but says she still wants to carry it on (our domain doesn't expire until July). I feel like I've lost my best friend, but I'm mostly scared that she's already lost herself because of a guy and I just don't know what to do. I've stopped chasing her for plans because she's always busy now (we used to meet up weekly), and stopped messaging because there won't be a reply. She checks up on me every now and then and I haven't been doing well at all, but I don't want the few times we talk to be negative and depressing. I just feel so clueless right now and I miss her. Any advice?"

ff,"How do you tell your kids to handle weird adults?
When I was 14, my best friend's mom started accusing me of smoking. I'd been best friends with her daughter since we were in 1st grade and I was over their house all the time. But for some reason when I was 14, she started asking. And she very low key but repeatedly accused me of smoking for about 2 more years. I had always been a straight A kid, top of my class, and a ""good"" kid. I had tried one cigarette when I was 13, had HATED it, and never tried another. I wasn't around anyone who smoked, no friends, no peers, no family members (immediate or extended) smoked, so there's no chance I smelled like smoke. But friend's mom persisted, and told me that she thought that I smoked because she found cigarette butts at the end of their driveway. Because obviously that couldn't have been from anyone else right?

Now in hindsight, her behavior was absolutely bizarre. As a teen, I accepted it as, she's an adult, and while I questioned her and vigorously fought back whenever she'd say something, it never occurred to me to get a sane adult involved. I'm hoping to install in my kid that they should tell me stuff like that if it ever happens. While nothing truly bad happened in my case, the lady was off her rocker, and I'm lucky nothing else happened.

How did people with older kids do that? Like I know my parents gave me the ""if people are making you uncomfortable, talk to us"" speech but this never made me upset, I just got angry and baffled at first, but then it kind of became this joke among all our friends and we just laughed at her. In hindsight, this could have ended very poorly for me had the mom escalated."

Okay so this past 5 months have been overwhelming. I’ve had a lot of major things happen. I got married in October and over the past year I’ve been connecting with my father and half brothers (who I just consider brotthers) and that whole side off the family. My dads never been apart of my life. I saw him probably about 4 times out of my 26 years on earth. The last time until this past week I saw my dad was when I was 10 so 16 years ago. That was also the last time I ever flew on a plane. I decided to fly down about two weeks ago for a week and I had such a good time connecting with my brothers and my oldest brothers wife and my nephew and grandparents and everyone! I loved the idea of everyone together closely and always at each others houses and I got along so well with my brothers and it was really nice. My brother and sister in law decide to that they’re going to move back to Florida where my dad and dads family is and they all really want me to move there. They love the idea of us getting close as a family and setting traditions and spending holidays together. Honestly I love that idea. My problem is my mother raised me, she’s always been there for me. She has nobody other than me. She doesn’t even have a car I drive her places. My grandmother who is also soo important to me she’s my second mother she’s been in a nursing home for 10 years and she’s confused a lot but still not that confused. The thought of leaving them makes me want to cry and I feel like I couldn’t. My mom would feel so betrayed and angry at me. She’s already feeling a little hurt because I’m getting closer with my dad that family. Which is wrong but she has a lot of issues of her own. The thought of leaving my grandma I could never. :( I just don’t know what to do. I’ve never left NY my husband also has his father here and his father would hate me if I brought “his son” away. My husband acts like he dose not care but ofcose he must. I just don’t know what to do I feel so stuck like if I even considered moving I’d feel so selfish and horrible. I couldn’t leave my mom and I feel like she wouldn’t come with me she’d be so angry that I was “choosing my father who did nothing for me and his family who ignored me” over staying near her. Idk this is probably all too soon also but I just want to form good relationships with my brothers and nephew and soon to be niece. And my dad. I don’t want my life to pass away and miss it all. Ever since I came back from visiting them for a week my mom has been giving me such a guilt trip about spending my money to go visit them or how she feels used and it’s crazy to me. Idk what to do But this is for sure a rant. Thanks for listening forever did."
ff,"I feel like I am annoying my friend.
I have noticed recently that I have been texting my friend a lot and I’m the one to always start the conversation.  The thing is, I am usually the shy one and they are the outgoing one.  Since they don’t start conversations, I feel like I am annoying them or bothering them.  What do you guys think?  Has something like this happened to you?"
ff,"Is she toxic or am I reading too much into it...rant warning
So to nutshell my relationship with her is that we met at our last job and hang out a lot. It's still a fairly new friendship but I'm noticing some things that are starting to get to me. I'm unemployed now and she has a awesome new job.

So first thing I noticed was she didn't used to be the one to call me   but then when she needs a ride somewhere then she wants to chat and will try to segway the ride request in. If she made a habit out of calling any other time then I wouldn't stress it. It just makes me feel used when ""I just want to check on you"" turns to ""I need a ride"". 

Which brings me to the other issue. When she does call me it's the most disrespectful phone etiquette I have ever seen. After she knows she is going to get a ride she stays on the call(must be out of guilt or not wanting to make it seem like it's the only thing she wants.) but while she's on the phone she does not pay attention to me. Like she'll make active listening sounds that don't match up, like uh huh and a giggle when I just told her that I might need to give my cats up. Without telling me or warning or any sort of hint she'll just start talking to someone else around her like I'm not even on the other end. Worst yet almost always these calls are while she is at work and is just bored. On my end I'm distraction free and at the most filling out a job applications or pacing and I dunno I feel like if you are going to call your friend you should acknowledge they are on the other line and not just background noise while you browse the internet. 

Which brings me to her job. Her job to me is the most ideal job I could think of and I already know that but she brags about to the point that I'm getting really bitter. She keeps telling me about how many hours she's getting and during one of those phone calls even worked out how much she was expecting to make on her next check(unprompted). And she's so excited about 3 week paid vacation she is getting, and her health benefits and tuition reimbursement so she's going to take some classes on company dime. I mean I expressed how happy I was for her but she brings it up enough that I just wonder if she likes hurting me. 

Then there is her and her boyfriend. There is a whole thing about her and her psycho ex who even though made her feel afraid for her life, she still loves and talks to. WHILE WITH HER BOYFRIEND. I don't think she cheats on her boyfriend but I don't understand that whole deal that seems like an issue for another reddit thread all together. But yeh she does brag about how much sex she has with her boyfriend and how much they love each other. Which brings me to this next issue that I couldn't even wrap my head around.

So I brought her home from work the other night and we were hanging out at my apartment. At some point she realizes that she forgot her keys back at work. This was after her work closed for the day. So I don't see the big deal I offer up ""well when your boyfriend picks you up then he can let you in."" But she doesn't seem to be hooking to that and is like ""I'm going to check the bus scheduled and just because I'm curious I'll check uber prices."" I'm really confused at this point. 

Essentially, her plan was to just go to her boyfriends work and hang out there till he finishes closing. Keep in mind we are neighbors, he doesn't have to go out of his way more than one street over and he has picked her up from my place before. Now he works about 30mins away so it would be a hell of a trek to drop her off there and make way back while it's dark and rainy and I don't know the area at all. At some point the brother of her boyfriend calls and says they can go hangout while she's locked out and she doesn't even ask me if I want to join or anything just leaves as if she had just been waiting at the busstop that whole time. 

She reassures me that she does like hanging out and I think we do have fun when she is hanging out. So I really don't want to cut her out of my life as I tend to do. It's just tonight seemed to be the worst.

So she calls me up and tells me that her boyfriend is off of work so she won't need a ride and she thought that we could all hangout. Since we were going to meet up with some more friends.

Welp, the other friends canceled and it was just us 3. We had some dinner and then her boyfriend suggested we go see a movie. I was already dressed and ready so why the hell not. I'm pretty sure she agreed(it's honestly hard to tell sometimes with her.) We got there and the movie me and her boyfriend were wanting to see was already playing. And she was being indecisive but eventually agreed to go. So me and him are hurrying to get to our seats while she just takes her time shuffling along. We already missed the first 15minutes. We had just had dinner but she wanted to stop at the concession and she just didn't seem interested at all about being there.

So we watch the movie and about midway she leaves, I assume to go to the bathroom but shes gone for about 15minutes and I'm just sitting there thinking ""she wants us or one of us to go check on her"" but I wanted to watch the movie and I didn't feel like putting up with her drama. 

Afterwards she passive aggressively sits at her seat through the entire credits. Which didn't have mid credit or end credit footage. So I ask her whats wrong, and she's like I just felt a wave of depression and just wanted to go home and didn't know why I was even here or watching this movie and I felt forced into the whole thing. WHICH CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. If any one was forced it was me, she called me for that night out and I feel she is trying to make herself out to be a victim in it. 

I don't want to end this with her, because I like her and her friends which I only know through her so it would mean cutting all of them out. It's just I keep seeing how selfish she can be. I don't know if this friendship can be saved or worth saving."
ff,"Fear of leaving
Tl;dr; Sob story. I think i don’t love my mother as much as i should.

I am looking to leave to Australia with my Australian husband.  I have a small family and I am very close to my dad’s side. 

I don’t feel like i have much ties to Canada except for my dad, his wife and my grandmother. I also have a young niece on my mother’s side (me and my brothers don’t have the same father). 

I’m scared of missing out on my niece growing up.

I’m scared my grandmother will get sick and i won’t be there fast enough.

I’m scared of the same thing for my dad. He’s still in a very good shape but i’m his only child.

Most of all, it makes me realise that i won’t really miss my mother. I love her but i am not close to her in any way and we don’t really get along. And i know she will make a big deal about me leaving even though we’ve never had a real relationship. 

I feel bad about this. Anyone else in that kind of boat? Loving one of your parents less?"
ff,"Ending a friendship (This post is insanely long FYI)
I have a mate [17M, nearly 18] whose currently in a relationship with a girl [just turned 16] that he is completely infatuated by. He buys her stuff constantly, despite his financial situation (more on that later) and does lots of other things (also more on that later).

This friend of mine completely revolves his life around this one girl. He once told me he would do anything for her and that he would kill himself if they broke up (he's also depressed, which I think he should fix before even being in a relationship but it's too late now) he also said he would feel 100% responsible if she were to kill herself (she's not depressed. It was hypothetical. When I told him it wouldn't be his fault as everyone is responsible for their own actions, I simply received a ""shut up"". There have been many incident like this where I've truth bombed him and he's stuck his head in the sand and might as well be saying ""lalala I can't hear you!""

Unfortunately for my mate, these feelings don't appear to be reciprocated. He buys her gifts all the time, even though his mum can barely afford fuel due to her unemployment and the fact she's a single mum. He bought her a bath bomb and perfume and other stuff for her birthday (would be upwards of $50 (Australian dollars btw if that's even a concern) from a family that sometimes has $0 in their bank account when he didn't even get anyone else (including me) a gift for our birthdays. The girl doesn't even seem phased by his financial situation or his depression. If she cared, wouldn't she ask to not have gifts to help him out?. Not to mention that she hasn't bought A THING for my mate. In real life they seem like a stable couple but it's much worse. 

The mate also purposely neglects invites from his mates (including me) for her. We invited him to see Star Wars: The Last Jedi and he messaged her about how he didn't really want to go (me and a mate broke into his Snapchat account. His iPad charger is broken and he can't afford another one so he gave us username and password to Snapchat so we could do his streaks which apparently matter. Also this is another testiment to his financial situation. Can't afford a cheapo third party cord for his iPad)

We looked through his messages and pretty much he's sending ""almost nudes"" thankfully with consent and a thotty dog filter picture (even though he would call anyone else that did it a thot to fit in) he also constantly asked to call on discord to which she replied only with ""sorry"" or ""can't"". No explanation whatsoever. Her friends are also incredibly irresponsible (thankfully he sees through that)

When my mate is talking to me or anyone else. All we get is a bombardment  ""what if she doesn't like me"" and other relationship jargon. I don't care but I have to pretend to. He cannot talk about anything else ever. It's just relationship this relationship that. I'm sick of it.

When he was at a very dark time in his life, me and 3 of my mates (2 girls including the girlfriend and one guy) made a group chat to talk about how we help him. We all talked very in depth except for the girlfriend. My mate asked her ""what do you think of all this were talking about (we went very in depth into his situation) to which her response was ""I don't know"" after saying NOTHING. 

I'm sick of his ignorance. I'm sick of him neglecting me and the other lads. I'm sick of it all. He even tried to seize control from his girlfriend. She went to hi five me and he said ""why are you bringing him over here"" in an incredibly annoyed tone"" 

I know I'm only the ""when Chloe isn't present talk to him isntead"" guy. He doesn't care. 

How do I cut him out of my life whilst causing the least ruccus possible?
(I have 2 other friends who have identical opinions so if you offered advice I'd be able to tell them too)

If you have anything I need to clarify please ask and I will do so. I typed all this on a phone so it's kinda hard. 

Thankyou very much to those who read and answer."
ff,"I moved 2,000 miles away for college six years ago. Parents have never visited
I'm unsure how to feel.  I moved to the other side of the country (USA) six years ago because I was accepted to a wonderful school in California.  My parents aren't too wealthy but are firmly middle class.  I could not afford to trac back home because I was barely living paycheck to paycheck until recently.  I paid for everything myself - textbooks, housing, transportation.  Of course, they helped out a bit as holiday gifts, but I've never received a care package or any extra aid.  

I am graduating next month and feel a bit sad that my parents aren't even sure they want to come for my graduation or party (that I'm paying for myself!).  My mom said she's busy with work and has to coordinate a lot.  She always says ""maybe next summer we'll make a trip out there!""  I'm the first person in my family to graduate college and it's kinda sad that nobody in my family cares to recognize how hard it was to do this on my own.  

I last called my dad in mid-December for his birthday.  I wanted to see how long it would take him to actually call me.  It's been three months and I've not heard a word from him.  

I was thinking about going back home this summer for a month, but am starting to question whether I should or not.  I love my life here and wish they cared enough to see it.  They have no clue what I do for work, what my degree is in, or where exactly I live.  It's been six years!  My mom just bought a house so I know she's at least had some money for a $300 plane ticket.  

What should I do?  Visit this summer and pretend everything is fine?  Wait it out and see how long it takes one of them to call me?  Should I beg them to come to my graduation/party (I've already asked several times). I feel so awkward making up excuses for them all the time (my friends often ask when my family is coming to visit). 

Thanks!"
ff,"Uneasy family members
I have had a rough and lonely childhood, in fact i do not want to remember my childhood. There used to be daily fights in the house between my mom and dad. My mom used to talk rudely then and talks rudely even now. She behaves differently outside the house and is a complete different person inside the house, behaves as though we are a burden for her. My dad is no angel either, he is arrogant and adamant, impatient and often has anger control problems, never felt close to him when a child and even now. Never felt any love towards my parent, I always had thoughts about running away from them. To add fuel to the fire my Father's mother will try to instigate any fight on any trivial matter between my mom and dad,I stayed all along with her throughout my childhood but I always thought of her as a monster. She never allowed me or my brother to ever mingle with other children freely and we didn't have many friends. I feel suffocated between my family and want to move away from them shift to another place and be independent. I have finished my graduation and still stay with my family but i feel they sap my energy and I am always negative and depressed staying with them. Criticism is a big part of our family, you are not spared if you make even a minute mistake. Appreciation word is not in my family's dictionary. On top of that my family is conservative and my mom is very very conservative in the bad sense. She will criticize other girls and women for wearing slightly short or tight clothes, but if someone wears the same clothes in our family she will applaude it. My father too judges women based on the clothes they wear and how they look, he doesn't spare men either calling them names based on their physical features. I am tired with this outlook and want to leave the house as soon as possible.There is no room for opinion in my family, especially my father who does not want to listen to anybody else and has fought with me on several occasions. He does not spare me insulting in front of other people. I don't feel easy staying along with them and at the same time feel guilty for depending financially on them. I have always felt hate for them in my heart and mind. Though they have provided me with all the facilities they have not provided understanding and love...they never understood me.What should I do?"

What I mean is- if I don't start a conversation, there will be no conversation. If there's a lull in the conversation, I've got to fill it or the conversation ends there. If I make plans with my friends (Usually to play a game, watch a movie, something like that) there's a 90% chance they'll forget, or just lose interest, or ignore it.

ff,"Accidentally kissing my friend after a party, what did i fuck up
So there's this situation that happened once a week or two ago that kind of made my pretty-close-but-not-best friend dude friend feel...distant? I'm not sure but it coincides with the event and theres this subtle awkward ""accidentally"" distant attitude i feel coming from him, though I apologized for the kiss the very same day by text, that happened the morning after i slept in his bed at his party (we were 5 friends chatting in his bedroom until 6 am and the others left but we fell asleep spooning. madeout when we woke up. He has a girlfriend whos super jelly and absolutely doesnt want him to mess around, even tho he cheated on her a few weeks ago without telling. I have a boyfriend of 2 years that i love as well but we have a history of cheating on eachother and not knowing how to end this. 
POINT IS, i really wanna have sex with my friend right here. Once or whatever, i don't really care, but i want my hots to go away and while hes only generically attractive, with very bland taste in women (im bisexual af and i don't understand most straight men tastes alright) , hes really more than that and has some kinks i share. Plus, everyone has had some sort of relationship or hookup with eachother in the past in our friend group, and him and I are the only pair that hasn't, so thats kind of anpther thing that makes the idea awkward. Not bright. I don't know what to feel about this.
I slept in his bed again last night after an intimate party with our friends because the guest room was busy. At some point I was pretty sleepy and felt his hand on my panties (i didnt have pants on because its uncomfortable), but he was well asleep. I gradually felt a tingling growing round there and it slightly woke me up, and after some time he was starting to give me hand stuff, leaned in to kiss me, and then - maybe it was because i didnt bring my toothbrush and had bad breath, i hope not for the love of god, a few seconds after that he removed his hand from what i literally had been dreaming -fuck my life for making me that horny, grabbed my boob a little and then got his hand back to him and fell asleep. I dont know why he stopped, and thats the most awlward thing : what could that mean? If we had full on sex we could both agree it was wanted but a mistake, and reveal sexual tension between us. But right now it looks like i dont really attract him at all, but he still likes some intimacy, just not with me. Is that your analysis as well? What do you guys read in this? 
Im well known for liking girls and have  short jaw length cherry red hair. A very cute face but Basically not your typical bombshell. Maybe that's what differences me from other girls he would dig having sex with? 
Otherwise...im just lost. I have no way of finding out if hes attracted to me in the slighest at the moment , and if we're not meant to bang, i really feel like we lost this kinda vibe in the past months where he would randomly text me every few days and have long, intimate convos about feelings and things happening in our lives, even if were not best friends, we got along well. (We dont really hang out alone together though, that might have happened once or twice only) I really hope i wont lose this definitely from those two awkward, unwanted situations(?) , it would really suck cause I really like him as a friend."
ff,"Ending a 6 year friendship over her husband


I [24F] am not sure how I feel about my friend’s behavior [28F] and I’m considering ending our friendship because of it. A little backstory, I’ve known her almost 7 years. We met through our boyfriends (they’re our exes now) and we used to do double dates and a lot of couple-y activities like roller skating or sleepovers and things like that. She and I stayed friends despite the break-ups with our boyfriends at the time. But our friendship has been a little rocky because of her busy schedule. She usually works 40-60 hours in any given week and she even lived in another city for 18 months so I didn’t always get to see her or hang out as much as I would have liked. But we’ve kept in touch through social media. I’ve always expressed a desire to hang out more, like doing road trips or daycations or local activities like concerts but she’s either too busy or financially strapped to do it. So typically we either see each other on our birthdays and that’s about it.

The problem I’m having is that she’s married to this guy she met 4 years ago and I’ve been single for  5 years. I have a FWB [25M] who I’ve been in a “situationship” with for 18 months. I kept that a secret from her because it’s not a real relationship and I’m not sure if it’ll ever become one. She’s met him recently through a fluke of bumping into each other while he and I were out at a store. Ever since she became aware of his existence, she’s been pressuring me to plan “double dates” like going to the drive-ins to see the new Star Wars Movie or coming over to their house for Redbox movies and dinner. I already told her that’s not really the type of relationship that I have. I’ve mentioned the idea of all 4 of us hanging out to him casually to see if he’d be interested but he doesn’t want to do it.  When I told her that I rather she and I just go to the movies together or girls’ night over at my place, she said she can’t because she wants to spend time with her husband when she’s not busy working. I feel like she’s not really going to spend time with me unless I give in and do “couples” activities.

I just feel like she and I are in such different places in our lives and have different values when it comes to friendship that it'd be better to end it now than to continue trying to spend time with someone who doesn't seem to want to do things just the two of us. Is it wrong of me not to want to be friends because of this?"
ff,"Girl friend pregnant (lgbt)
I m a girl My girlfriend is pregnant with a male friend we used as a sperm donor. She did this 1 month after starting dating me but I stayed with her because i like her and I do like kids but now I have no feelings about this. She keeps saying I m not happy to have a baby but I m not having a baby, her and her friend are so no I m not happy, but I m not not happy. When the baby is born of course i will love and treat it like it s mine. But am I wrong for not being excited saying I m having a baby when in reality I m just the step parent."
ff,"Is it me?
Hello. This is my first time posting here. 

  So the other day one of my friends texted me, saying I think she's dumb and that she demands respect (this is a month after I just hung out with her; everything seemed fine). She then accused me of insulting her and the school she goes to. I insisted that she took what I said out of context (for example she said I think her major is easy. I never said this, I said it wasn't math focused. Plus she herself said she is having an easy time). She constantly asks me if I think she is intelligent and I always tell her she's smart in her own way like everyone is. Anyway, I said sorry and have a good holiday but she didn't reciprocate and just told me to watch what I say and not to tell anyone she said this.

  This isn't the first time this kind of thing happened. One person I know just hates me (quote:""*** hates you and everything about you. He just does."") and I have no idea why. Sometimes he's cool, other times he ignores me (he has pointed out that I'm light skinned black and he's dark so apparently I'm treated better; eveb if that's true I am not responsible for that). Another person hated me for reasons unbeknownst to me (excluded me from group chats and gatherings, made this known to others) and now I'm told they love me (largely made up with this person but I never knew why they hated me to begin with). I'm extremely confused by all of this. 

  Now I'm a guy who was known as the smart, quiet kid in school with a lot of knowledge. Occasionally I'll let people know my opinions and they'll get a kick out of it. However, I really made it a point to be polite to people even when I disagreed with them or didn't like them. Most people I know say I'm genuinely kind or polite even to the point of being boring.I go out of my way to refrain from cracking mean jokes or speaking bluntly because I know it'll offend people. I try to balance the thoughts in my head and the words I speak (isn't this normal?). Most people at my current school say I'm very nice and friendly. Am I doing something wrong or are people just being bad/weird to me? 

TL;DR: I tend to get people who hate me and I don't know why; most people say I'm a kind and logical person."
ff,"(New York) Who's in the wrong here?
I'm a little upset over a disagreement with one of my best friends that occurred in late August and has resulted in us not speaking or hanging out since. We're in college and we were out together at a party. We were talking to some random guys, and I left because I saw my ex and was talking to him. My friend texted me asking where I was and I told her I was talking to him. She told me to go to her and I said okay, and asked if he could come. Then she just said i'll just go home see you later. I was like, no don't leave alone I'll come with you without him. But she kept refusing my offer and ignored my calls when i tried to find her. When she got home she complained to my other friend that I ditched her and made her walk home alone, when I offered to go to her and tried to get to her before she left. Since then she said she was taking time for herself whatever that means and literally hasn't contacted me since. I have tried apologizing numerous times and being normal but she isn't really having any of it, and says she isn't mad at me. We haven't spoken in around 2 months now and I'm really upset because I didn't feel like I did anything wrong for one of my best friends to hold some sort of weird grudge and I miss her.

ff,does anyone want to hear the story about the first ever 'beef' between my friend and i?
ff,"In an awkward situation with my best friend. She wants me to tell how I feel towards her - how should I?
I’ve been friends with her for 3 years. She’s a lovely person and I really like her, but there were some occasions where I felt weird around her. 

She apparently sensed it and recently asked me what’s wrong between us, telling I should tell her if there’s something. 

Some of the things I’m thinking of telling her are:

- she often kind of invites herself when she learns I hang out with my friends and invites other people (that I don’t know well) as well without asking me when I organise something (picnic, trip etc.) 

- she’s a nice person and means well, but she sometimes says things that hurt my feelings. For example, she said she couldn’t wait to move into a new flat with her bf or how he’s like in bed when I was having a difficult time after a breakup, and she often assumes I’m broke and I feel sort of belittled. 

- she tells my rather personal stuff to her other friends, like gossip

I could list several things, but I’m not sure if I should be upfront, as she has social anxieties and I don’t want her to feel bad or scared in social situations. Or are there nicer ways to put them? 

Also, I should probably mention that I have a small circle of friends, and she’s basically been my only friend that I get to see regularly, I’ve been really good friends with a girl (B) that I met partly through her for the past few months. I enjoy hanging out with her (A), and we text each other all the time, but I’m not sure how she (A) feels about this.

He was attempting to run from the cops and he hit a telephone pole and he died. Im assuming he was DUI or picking up drugs. I’m not one bit surprised. In fact, I’m surprised he lived this long. 

He was given every resource and opportunity in the world and he fucked every single one of them up for the past 50+ years. He was one of those people who were better off just in jail so they can’t do harm to themselves, others, and the community. 

I cringed every time I saw him around. I couldn’t understand for the life of me why people put up with his shit and enable him. The same people who put up with him were the same ones who would complain and complain about him. My mom didn’t want my younger siblings around him.. we wouldn’t put it past him to do stuff to kids. 

I was so sick of hearing what Kenny did or tried to do. I feel absolutely horrible for my great grandfather who is 85 and is ALWAYS the one to clean up his mess. 

I feel bad for my great grandfather in the sense he has to burry his son and once again, clean up the mess that he has left. I may be the only person to not see this as a “loss”.

Luckily, the paramedics came in time and he was able to survive through surgery. He's on medication now and all of his tests have come through positive, but he is still overweight. He's 61 and I realize he's not getting any younger. My mother and I have been trying to get him to eat healthier and stop drinking so much, he drinks chardonnay every night and a lot of it a week.

He says he works too much and that we are just ganging up on him. Psychologically I believe he's just so stubborn that he won't ever admit to actually being unhealthy and doing something about it. He's tried to workout but he never makes much progress.
 I want my dad to live for as long as possible, but he's just so incredibly stubborn and toxic about it that eventually i'm afraid he's not going to last much longer, we are both incredibly frustrated.

My husband and I have been married since August 2016. I am now pregnant due in April.

They assume that we will be going on vacation this year too, the baby would be 4 months old I DONT WANT TO GO. FYI, his dad is great and hands off and his mom is very opinionated and gives too much advice but she means well and has been nothing but good to me. 

Reasons I don't want to go

1. We have lived with them for the past 5 months, I need a vacation from THEM. I am used to my own space and being able to retreat, I no longer really have that.

2. It will be a 4 hr car ride with a four month old. It may not be that big a deal but other than the car ride, I just rather be home and comfortable and not in another state staring at a beach for 7 days that I don't even want to be at.

3. My husband's older sister has gone out of her way to make me feel excluded in the past and said borderline mean comments. We made some headway last year but I barely tolerate her and avoid her and really don't want to be stressed out for 7 days because of it plus taking care of My baby. Everyone else doesn't see this, or sees her aggressive behavior as assertive.

4. I don't even know why I've gone the last 3 years as by the 3rd day I am drained. I am trying to better listen to myself instead of forcing myself to endureeat something I don't have to

ff,"Group of friends exclude one person and I’m now stuck I between...
So I have a group of about 13 friends, some of us have been friends most of our lives and others have joined over the past 10 years. 

One friend I’ve always be closest to went though a tough time recently and it was decided by some of the louder group members that she shouldn’t be part of the group anymore as she wasn’t making any effort and she was being a drama queen! (She definitely was not and they were all being extremely judgemental without knowing her full story) I totally disagreed with them and confronted them about it. The loud ones argued back and the others stayed quiet and a few then spoke to me privately later and said they agreed with me. There are a few that I will never again consider a friend going forward!

My dilemma is that there are still a good few in the group I enjoy spending time with and would like to remain friends with and I am also friends with the excluded friend! I feel that I either have to leave the friendship group or remain in it and stay quiet about how awfully they treated my friend and put up with the nasty few! Either way I feel awful. 

I don’t really know the purpose of this post but I don’t really have any other friends so if I break away from this group I wouldn’t have any left apart from the other excluded friend. I’m not sure they really are my friends anymore as they haven’t been there for me recently so I suspect I’d be next on the chopping block anyway."

Im 25 and have lived within an hour of my family my whole life. I work for the family business, so Ive seen my dad and brother every day for the last 6 years. I believe it causes me extra stress and when I mess up at work it feels twice as bad. Have any of you been in a similar situation?"
ff,"I have a close friend who is problematic, but not towards me
A couple of years ago, I had a falling out with one of my friends and during this time, I fell back on this girl in my class, who I will call Blue. We got close in only a few months, and eventually, this will be the only time we will ever be in the same class. It was just the two of us. I'm in one of her classes now and my friends still associate me as her best or one of her closest friends. It's not a particularly good association (doesn't reflect on me though, just her).

A lot of people don't like her, especially the people I'm friends with now. I haven't been around for a while (I moved down to Brighton for a bit of time) and I haven't seen her either, but I know that she doesn't have a lot of friends. I've been hearing stories and past anecdotes about her that really troubled me, so I'd like to have some advice.

This one girl (who would never lie about something like this because she's so sweet, probably still hasn't gone through puberty) said that Blue once pit her up against the teachers and made her cry because she was so stressed and she didn't understand the situation. Blue has a kind of controlling personality and will not be open-minded to other people's ideas and input. An idea of close friend of my close friend, Yellow, was swept by as Blue simply dismissed it, and just wrote what she wanted to do in a group project. Yellow is also quiet, VERY passive and formerly a good friend of Blue and to some point, even I, so when I heard this happening to Yellow, I was really shocked that Blue could even do something like that.

She will also guilt-trip you and self-deprecate herself. She will tell you that everyone hates her and that she's really bad at a subject she does really well in. It's annoying, and sometimes I even hear it, but to others she does it in this really soft, guilt-tripping voice. It's a problem because often, she's the problem and then she guilt-trips to turn it to look like she's saying that the people calling her out are just trying to make her feel bad. 

But Blue has never done any of this to me. When I'm around her, we talk about our futures and Star Wars. She jokes and memes a lot, but because we're not as close anymore, they aren't as funny. I avoid confrontation too so I almost never rebutt her points. Recently, she apologized to me about how poor her behaviour was back then, but I didn't understand what she was talking about. Now, I get it. But her behaviour wasn't just 'back then' either, it was also just a couple (maybe about two) years ago. Maybe even now, but everyone has probably already distanced themselves from her.

She also has this fake 'caring' voice that she uses around the people in her music group. She never uses this voice around me, but the music people all generally speak like that. The thing is, the 'caring' side to her is just like a mask, and the people who know her know that she's not usually like that. She has hurt their friends who don't deserve to be hurt, and for no apparent reason either.

I know that most of my friends feel uncomfortable bringing her up around me because it'll be something negative (I've never heard anyone who really knows her say something positive about her), but because of that I've been sheltered to how she treats her classmates. Another girl (Red) once said that while she was consoling a friend who didn't like to be touched, Blue came in, wrapped her arms around the sobbing girl and 'glared' at Red like one of those mean girls. Never have I ever heard something so cliched and dramatised, but unfortunately, I could definitely picture it.

When I'm around her, I definitely don't feel like her personality is weighing down on me, but I'm conscious of the connotations surrounding her. All the girls mentioned are also my friendly mutuals, so they don't associate me with her, as I'm generally polite, quiet and will crack a joke around them. I also know that Blue doesn't like people so when we were walking from our class, I'm worried that we'll bump into someone that doesn't like her or whom she doesn't like. So yes, I am very bothered about how people view her, mostly because there actually is something to dislike.

What should I do? Slowly back out of this friendship? Should I slowly doorslam her until the end of the year when our class is over? Should I just continue being her friend despite her bad behaviours? 

Two things: the stories are most definitely true, and I don't want Blue to know that I know about her being a bad classmate. I overheard these stories from reliable people.

Sorry for the long post. Please help."

ff,"Classmate/ bullying problems
I have a classmate who constantly bullies our other classmates. Seems like she feels as if she is superior, the leader of our whole class and everyone has to follow and do what she says. If someone is late to the meetings she is harassing them. She is being very rude and insulting. Her voice is always extremely loud, and if she has a problem with people she always shouts it to the class instead of approaching the person and discussing it with them like a normal person would do.

For example, she was upset with a group of her classmates because they didnt want to follow whatever she says, and she heard that they might have said something bad about her, but instead of approaching them to ask them about it, if its true or whatsoever, everytime we have meetings she will just talk extra loud and will let our whole class listen to her nonsense comments like she keeps on talking about ""fake people"", as if she wanted the group who said something about her to hear it and feel guilty.

I dont get why she does it and why she is the way she is. Does anyone have an idea? And what should we do about it? It's getting annoying and I know already if we would approach and talk to her she would put the blame on everyone else and just be more mad and find stupid excuses. Does anyone have any advice? By the way, including teachers or some other people doesnt help either so any other advices or info to shed light on this is welcome. Thank you"

ff,"Calling me a bitch as a form of endearment not cool
This was a great friend of seven years. We had so much in common and a few things not in common. We met in our mid and early 20s (im being 5 years younger). We met on a the job years ago.

Well five months ago when she was stressing about her day...

Listen bitch our manager gave us more rules....

Time froze like huh? :/😨
Also I'm 30 shes 35.

I let it slide since I thought maybe that was a mistake. Maybe she was so stressed out?

Well it didn't end and got worse...

Everyday she leave me text messages, and recordings updating me of her life and each sentence I was called a bitch.

Listen BITCH....
Yeeees BITCH.....
Then this BITCH at work....,but you get me BITCH....
I told myself, BITCH you need to hit the gym 
( Yes at times she called herself a bitch which is fine.)

Lucky for men they'll never get called bitch by her. 

I made excuses for her saying maybe it's a temp phase. 3 months in I told her I don't like being a bitch every sentence positive or not. She said this how her and her family always talked. I thought I known you for 7 years...never heard of this. Then she continued to talk and yup calling me a bitch. 

I continued telling her to stop at times. Other times I just tried to ignore. 

One month ago she texted me that shes working with a nurse who is a woman who has a grill in her mouth.
And how cool she thought that was. And how she hopes to become a nurse someday with a grill.

I had to catch myself....to me grills look ugly on men and worse on women😝.
I faked it like....yea...um cool... :/

Well a 5 days ago I got fed up. I told her 6 days ago calling me a BITCH 50 or so times a day must stop!  

We never had a argument...maybe a few disagreements.  She went off and was pissed I didn't want to be called bitch for fun. I told her I'm not a dog in heat! I told her my name and that I'm  a girl or woman hell even calling me a female is nicer. She said shes not about that girl power or that feminism crap! 

FYI...shes actually into feminism and don't know it. I would love to be a house wife,take my voting rights away and I love dresses. Shes willing to support a 3rd world man soon,talk about how if she gets a great degree she can support her man lol.

I felt myself at the time great sadness here she was going off at me for not wanting to be called a bitch. She then says her family call each other bitches alllll the time. 

After she went off....she went back to talking about how she wants to go to school. I never felt so degraded and disrespected.  I decided this friendship ends. I'm very nice, and consider how others feel....she basically treated me like a door mat. 
Next day I texted her I'm not a dog. Not into being called a bitch daily and I no longer can do this. After I texted that I blocked her number asap. 

It's crazy about 3 or 4 months ago. She was mad that when she called a coworker a bitch instead of saying girl or other friendly terms...she caught that coworker talking about her warning others to stay clear of her because she will call you a bitch. She called me about it all mad. I told her I actually understand that girl....she completely ignored my remark.

I plan on changing my number soon...maybe. 

But I do feel better that I don't have to hear that hood talk anymore. 

I was her only friend. Hopefully she can make new friends who don't mind being called that daily. 

I have friends and recently by mistake made a new one. New one is like me and we respect each others boundaries.  I like that shes another race as well,so I can learn her view of things. 

Yes just glad it's over. Now if I'm called a bitch it's a insult :)"
ff,"Unreturned texts
An old college dorm friend who started organizing reunions I saw twice last year with other former classmates has not responded to my last two texts including a Holiday greeting to him and his family-- which I consider rude. I made it a point to keep in touch with people especially during the holidays. Am tempted to zap this person and drop him but my wife says to let it slide. I would not say we are close but am perplexed at the rudeness of not even mustering a reply to a holiday greeting even if its fake. I've done nothing to this person except it came out during our last group get together that I went on to get a law degree at an elite school. I never even discuss careers or money at these things if that is the reason. Baffling."

Hi! I am a graduate student in the Sociology Department at the University of California, Davis. I am conducting research on the relationship between sexual orientation and parenting strategies. There is currently a lack of research on bisexual, pansexual, and other non-monosexual identities, particularly as they relate to the family. I would love for you to help me fill this gap of knowledge by participating in my survey. 

Participation in this research includes taking a survey about your sexuality, your family history, and your thoughts on parenting, which will take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.

ff,"How can I tell me friend that I don't want to babysit his (difficult) kid?
I want to be a good friend, and there for him in case of emergencies. I've picked up his kid from daycare before when his babysitter called out on him. But then he asked me to babysit and the hours ended up being 8AM to 7PM(!). He asked me two weeks ago if I could babysit on February 3rd, and I told him I couldn't make a commitment so far in advance. (Knowing he'd have plenty of time to find a sitter). This is clearly not an emergency, and he's about to ask me again (it's a week away). I know I shouldn't have led him on at all; that it's better to be direct. But dear god, I cannot come up with the words to tell him I would rather die than spend any more time alone with his son. Last time I saw his kid, he literally threw a toy car at my face and it hit me in the mouth. He's incredibly defiant and screams bloody murder all day. He refuses to hold my hand if I take him out of the house to the park and screams and screams and I just hate that kidd!!!!!!! 

I know I can't tell him how much I dislike being around his kid, and I don't want to end up hinting at this. Any suggestions on a response text? I don't want to have to keep telling him I have plans. I want him to stop asking."
ff,"These parents physically hurt their teenage daughter by burning her with hot oil and hitting her with broomsticks due to her refusal to marrying a man much older than her who is paying $20,000.
This horrendous story just goes to show that your family isn't always this happy loving caring group of people who want the best for you. Sometimes your family can be toxic and parents can be bad at their jobs, and it's very important to know when to say no, and walk away if you can. Especially if your culture and religion like this young girl tells you to never say no to your parents and obey their commands no matter what, It becomes very hard to go against them and say no, but it is essential to draw that line for your own safety.

Last year me and one of my Best friend decided to get into a relationship.. it lasted a couple of months and she got disturbed due to some personal problems and i made a mistake of not giving her space as obviously I was worried as a boyfriend and also the best friend because she won't share what happened to her  and truly it was something bad..
We both had an amazing Friendship of 6 years before that and there may not have been a single day that went by without talking to each other.. its like she became an integral part of my life..
But after she started to distance herself from the relationship I did keep bothering her which was a mistake on my part and I did apologize to her for that.. 
she kept blocking and unblocking me since then and I tried my best to get back our friendship as it matters to me more than a relationship as out of the few people who truly know me and are as important as the organs of my body she is one of them..
and as we know even without one organ a person feels Handicapped as I do now...
Yes it might be selfish of me as I am the only one who wants the friendship to be like before.. all of my attempts have failed so far.. but its next to impossible to not think of her as she was my routine for past 6 years..

I know it was wrong but I had a gut feeling to check her messages today when I was helping her with something on her phone. I snooped and saw that my mother has been messaging this man (I do know of him as he helped my family in a business transaction 1 year ago). 

She has been messaging him for a few months almost every other night. It dates back to a year ago but it only started looking obsessive (every other day) from approximately 5 months ago.

He has not been replying her. If it's a reply, its extremely rare. It's constant double blue ticks (means he read the message) on whatsapp. What should I do?

ff,"I Feel Lonely and Scared I'll End Up Friendless. Need an Ear.
Ive come to the realization that I'm really scared I'll end up with no friends. I used to be the type who kept in touch with friends for years. But, I have either lost touch with or outgrown every friend I had in high school. 

The new ones I made in college are nice people for the most part and ended up being my roommate group (since sophomore year. I'm a 2nd semester junior.). But every friend group has their faults. And with this one, I don't feel like I fit in completely. 

4 out of the 7 of them are know-it-alls who will try to correct you on every little thing (like one time I was exaggerating and saying somewhere had 100x more people, and one of them came out of their room and said ""Um, I think it's actually 1000x more people."") Those 4 are also really uptight, don't get my sense of humor for the most part and seem like they're always trying to school me on what's appropriate (MIND YOU I NEVER JOKE ABOUT RACE OR OPPRESSED GROUPS OR ANYTHING OFF LIMITS LIKE THAT.). I just don't always feel seen or appreciated or like my intelligence is respected. There's also one I don't even like that much (no matter how much I've tried) because she has an arrogant, self-aggrandizing, my-way-or-highway attitude. 

The point is I don't always feel in sync with them. Even the ones I do feel in sync with, I don't feel like they reach out to me nearly as much as I reach out them (when we're not in school). And I don't like one-sided friendships. I'm worried we won't stay friends after undergrad. 

Also this year, 2 of them are graduating and I have to find a new roommate to fill in the spot that'll be in my room. I'll admit, I didn't make enough effort to hang out with people outside of my dorm, and everyone had settled into their friend groups so it's harder to make friends now with the people at my school. I don't know what to do. 

Part of me feels this is my fault for not getting a single in the first place, and trying to join this friend group when it was already established. They eventually came to see me as a member, and we've had good times but I don't know that these are ""my people"".

And part of me wants to get a single room next year, but I feel like I'll just be jumpstarting my social isolation and I'm also scaredy new roommates might be lunatics. 

Tl;dr - I've lost touch/outgrown my high school friends, don't fit in with my college friends, and am scared to end up alone without any friends. Need advice."

ff,"Advice please. Am I in the wrong or is she overreacting?
This is going to be a long post! 

This is my very first post! 

Me (F33) and, now ex best friend (F33) just had a major falling out and she’s blaming me. Here’s a little backstory;
We were best friends, did everything together, babysat each others kids and just hung out all the time.  I have 5 kids, she has 2. My youngest are 19 month twins, her youngest is 9 month old girl. 

I babysat last for her on Nov 1st. Before dropping her baby off, I always vacuumed because she spent all of her time on the floor. Nothing dangerous in her reach (obviously, I Baby proofed for my kids). She was rolling around and got over by my shoe rack and found something I didn’t see and, like babies do, she stuck it in her mouth. I went over to her and did a finger sweep to remove it but I couldn’t get it and it made her gag; not choke, gag. So I angled her down, patted her back and it fell out. She smiled at me when I turned her right side up, obviously unfazed by what just happened. I stayed calm, and did what needed to be done, no harm. Told mom about it and she seemed unfazed as well and stayed and chatted and left shortly after. Thought everything was fine until just a few nights ago. She sends me a text; that’s right, a text, and basically tells me that I can no longer be trusted to watch her kids and that the state of my house should’ve been a red flag. (My house is lived in, not a pig sty). She said I dropped the ball and let her kid stick something in her mouth and she could’ve choked. Also, I was so nonchalant about telling her about it and that means I was lazy and didn’t see it as a big deal. News flash- it wasn’t a big deal, nothing happened.  She said she wants me to apologize for putting her daughters safety at risk and that basically this friendship is over. I’m sorry but if it’s safe enough for my twins it’s safe enough for her daughter. She found something that I couldn’t see from my view point and stuck it in her mouth. I stayed calm, responded and everything was fine. Should I apologize? Did I do something wrong? She is refusing to talk to me face to face. I don’t feel like I should apologize for something every baby does. I just can’t believe she held onto this for so long. We’ve even hung out since then and she never said anything. Just some advice please."
ff,"Brother owes Mother money, lives with her and isn't paying rent. Advice please?
Not really sure which sub is the best place for this, so I've cross-posted in r/family, r/legaladviceuk and r/advice. Please let me know if any of them are inappropriate or if there are better subs for this. Thanks!

The back story to this is long and possibly convoluted, but the tl;dr is my brother has had financial troubles for many years. In 2012, after the death of our grandmother, our mother paid off a large sum of my brothers' debts. He then paid some of this back with his own inheritance from the same. As a result of various relationship and/or financial cock-ups he has then loaned various further sums from our mother but with almost no repayments. He then ends up in a position to either bail out back to our mothers or lose employment and go wherever it is you go when you have no home or job.

To be frank, we (myself, my partner and my mother) are at a loss as to what to do next. We think that perhaps we only have one realistic option (to kick my brother out and cut our losses) but this is something we would rather avoid. So we're asking Reddit for advice. So to  (try yet fail to) cut a long story short...

My brother moved back in with my mother in early December 2017 due to the breakup of a relationship. When he did so, he agreed (verbally) to both pay a very reasonable rate of rent and payments towards previous debts owed toward our mother (both monthly). He was given December as a 'payment holiday' of sorts. Two weeks later my brother took out a loan to replace his car as he needed transport to and from work. His previous vehicle was written off toward the end of his previous relationship and he did not replace it with the money gained from the resultant insurance claim. Due to poor credit history, our mother was guarantor for this loan.

Due to concerns regarding my brothers previous unreliability with regards to money my mother decided to make a written and witnessed agreement with my brother regarding rent, the loan, and payment of previous debts. However, we are all collectively broke (not as broke as my brother) and so paid legal advice was out of the question. After some research I drafted a basic agreement, it was signed and witnessed by my mother, brother, partner and myself. In hindsight I should probably have used a solicitor for this but it is what it is. 

Fast-forward to 05/02/2018 and no payments have been received for anything. My mother received both an email and text alert for late payment on the loan that she is guarantor of on 31/01/18 but no other correspondence. She has not contacted the loan company but has received no further correspondence so believes my brother has paid this instalment at least. My mother also received a phone call from the garage that my brother bought he new car from, for which he loaned the entirety of the cost as the majority of the loan my mother is guarantor. He still owes them money. 

In short, besides kicking him out of my mothers house and saying goodbye to both my brothers previous debts (and therefore a large amount of my mothers money) and also resigning my mother to paying for the loan he took out in December, what can we do? Does the written agreement we made mean anything legally? What can I do to help my mother claim the money she lent previously? Or are these things lost causes? 

Any and all help is much appreciated. We just don't know what to do, but don't want to see my  brother completely on his arse (unless I've put him on it...).


TL;DR My brother owes my mother a significant amount of money, lives with her, she is guarantor for one of his loans, he has not paid his agreed rent etc. and we know he owes others money. What do we do now? Can kick him out, don't want to, seems likely may have to soon. Cannot live with or afford this.

Edit: We are in the UK"

ff,"Am i a bad friend? I don't know what to do
Recently two friends of mine (dating) have cut me off entirely without providing a reason... Let's call them J and K. J is an old friend from years back, when we were kids, and K has been my friend since highschool (approx. Six years). Its happened before that they've cut me off periodically for no given reason, then their idea of making up is inviting me to a party and never speaking of the weeks or months that they had me blocked on social media, when i ask them to explain they get defensive, and say things along the lines of ""you KNOW what you did"" even when i try to explain that no, i actually don't. I've never consciously done anything to hurt them, the one thing i thought it could be was that I'm friends with a girl they dislike, but after recently confronting J its apparently not just that, there's a long list of reasons why I'm a terrible friend but he ""doesn't have time to list them"" or even name one. Feeling insecure about this I've confided in other friends who assure me that I'm not a bad friend, although I've asked that they tell me if i ever act like a bitch. 
Back to K and J, they recently went so far as to invite all 3 of my siblings along with a crowd of people they barely know to their housewarming, but made a point to exclude me- when my brother asked why the response was along the lines of I'm ""acting like a bitch"". I've tried just cutting them out but its hard after being friends (i think) for so many years. I've tried extending olive branches, explaining that i don't know what I've done wrong and if they could at least tell me then maybe i could apologize/fix the situation, but J responded with passive aggression and K, so far, hasn't responded at all. (Quite frankly i don't expect her to). 

Bottom line is, should i just cut them off entirely? Its hard since I'll be seeing a lot of K this year as we're studying the same course, and J is one of my brother's best friends. Please help"
ff,"Is he justified for being so mad ?? Thoughts on my plan?? No judgment please??
6 months ago I stayed with my aunt for two weeks but I really wanted to see my cousin who I’ve been talking to on Facebook.  Well,  I didn’t get to see him until like the day before I was supposed to leave and didn’t get to speak with him as the way we were seated at our gathering I’d have to literally yell across the table and I’m not like that.   So later that night I got in an uber and went to his house around like 11 pm lmfao and I told him I was coming but he was like no and he was pissed that I didn’t say much to him but I showed up it was raining, freezing, windy, etc and he didn’t let me in and so I left and went back to the airport cuz I didn’t have enough money to go all the way back to my aunts it was like 60 something miles away I only had enough to get to Newark. But he got super pissed at me and won’t talk to me blocked me on all social media but your girl is about to take that train for 5 hours and go again in like July/August but I’m not telling him I’m just gonna wait till he gets off of work.  I have zero way of contacting him other than physically going there.  Any idea what I should say so he can forgive me ?  I’m aware what I’m doing could potentially make things worse but if I leave it be we might not ever speak again.  I’ve also lost a substantial amount of weight since then and he probably won’t recognize me?  Thoughts please ?  I know what some of you might say but I really want to fix this??"
ff,"my parents created me and ruined me
my mother got pregnant with me just before she turned 15 and has always lived in a bad environment this lead to her using drugs and misusing alcohol. my father is 4 years older then my mother so he was 19 when my mother got pregnant. none of this is a problem other then my mothers bad choices. my parents split up when I was a baby and so growing up I was fed lies about both my life became a contest of who id love the most. lots of other things happen around the time I turn 10 and I then I started to live with my father and my three half brothers where taken away. my father never really did anything to help me cope with the separation and my mother has ran away by the time I found out. for the last 5 years my mother would occasionally contact me and talk about how things will change but nothing ever did.
 within the second year of me living with my father him and his wife decide to have a baby this happens and I get a new brother  who I am extremely attached to and love so much. This was fine until I was being neglected and cast out by my stepmother because I'm not her child and she didn't want me in the first place, she was just to desperate not to lose my father. so now that they have a baby things go her way a lot more. ( none of my family on my fathers side like my stepmother as she had a much better childhood and has become very stuck up from it ) I then stop spending as much time with them as I began to feel unwanted and my father has now become a very angry and belittling man who is uninterested in anything other than his laptop and phone. they began punishing me harshly for small things and neglecting my needs for example feeding me. because I had to earn my money to buy my own food if I didn't do everything they asked they wouldn't give me the money I needed to eat. so when I was 14 I started to lose weight as i had recently  met a boy that I liked and we would go for walks  and the obvious reason was that I couldn't afford to eat everyday but I did as my grandmother was secretly feeding me and giving me everything I needed and wanted as she noticed that I wasn't getting it. because my father and his wife are both very large people and visibly overweight they became angry that I was losing weight. they would regularly humiliate me in front of my relatives saying that I'm starving myself ( I wasn't I just really liked my now boyfriend and he enjoys walking)  the older I got the worse it become until it got to  my 16th birthday where it had gotten to the point they had gotten me my provisional driving licence and the cbt lesson so I can get a moped. this may seem nice but up until this point my birthday was just a garneted meal for me. they had also told my family to only give me money which they have taken and refused to give back no this day. their motive for doing this for me was so I had transport to the job they where forcing me to get so I had to start paying rent for my room.(my room is the place where things my father has that she doesn't like goes. this wasn't a problem to me as my father spends more money than he has on some really cool stuff) also useful information they claim money for me and have never told me this so they would also make me earn everything that I had and most of the things I had I paid for myself with the money I earned by doing everything they didn't want to do like pick my brother up from his school when he started going to the school playgroup. the only thing I didn't pay for was my phone.  when I was 15 I became qualified to look after children so they decided to misuse this and make me look after my brother more than I would have liked coz it took time away from my social life and school work. they would promise to pay for my time but they never did and in fear I would be punished and made to do more work without pay I didn't say anything. 
on the day of my cbt my stepmother dropped me there and then left to go see her family for the rest of the day. this is fine but I unfortunately couldn't do the practical text which was driving on the road so they sent me home early. I was stranded in a town that was very far  from the town I live in and had nobody to come get me. but luckily I found my friend shopping in the town with her brother and I went home with them. while on the way home I had text my stepmother explaining I wasn't ready to do the practical test, as it was too dangerous because I couldn't control the bike well enough to drive on a road safely. a few minuets later my father begins texting me angrily saying that ive wasted their money and to get a job ad pay for everything myself because I had apparently refused to get on the bike and just left the lesson. because of this I got home and packed a bag and went to my mothers parents house to stay and I had no intention of ever going back to live with my father and still don't as it has been 5 months since I left.
when I first left I stayed at my mothers parents house which was two towns away from where my father lives. that only lasted for a night though and in that space of time he had come there to see me and bring me my phone as I had left it ( he had a tracking devise on it so he always new where I was) and has started texting me on my Facebook saying that I am just like my mother and lots of other horrible things like I'm on drugs and pregnant and that I'm a slut and he also said he was going to get my boyfriend arrested. within a week I lived in the same town as my father as I still have to attend school but I am still refusing to go back I now live with my grandmother ( fathers mother
) and occasionally live at my boyfriends house for a week or so depending how I feel . 
within these last two months I have been in contact with social services as I want my things and money back and I also want contact with my brother but I don't want my father or his wife  to be present during the contact as I want nothing to do with them . 
last week I went there with my friends that have been helping me through the satiation of seeing my brother and his wife made him tell us to get out and them when I decided to leave she slammed the door on us at first then came out saying I'm not aloud to see him again. during this time I have found out that my father has lied to me about things all my life for example he always told me that he didn't know how old my mother was. this was proven to be a lie as my mother now lives not to fa away from me as she just got out of prison and she and others have told me about how my father attended her 16th birthday party and by then she was pregnant . I know am extremely confused about trusting people and have developed some sort of mental illness that my doctor has ignored to help me with. I'm now experiencing depressive and hyperactive episodes and will tend to black out and forget thing that have happened during long 
amounts of time . I don't know how to handle this situation can someone please give me advice on getting help and moving on with my life."
ff,"My mom went to go to a family gathering (I didn't go) and one of my aunt's seems to have forgotten my name. Is it reasonable to be bothered by this?
I don't see my dad's side of the family that much after I moved because its a long commute. However we still send out Christmas  cards and two of them call from time to time. 

One of my Aunts was having a retirement party and my mom went to it out of obligation more than out of wanting to. The Aunt who the party was for was welcoming and nice to her but the rest were just talking amongst themselves about politics and other crap.

One of my other Aunts who lives outside of the area (compared to us and the others) went up to my mom and said hi to her but when she asked about me she said ""How's your daughter?"".  Everyone else who asked about me asked about me by name,so my mom took notice of this and found it odd.

She told me about it when she got home and it bothered me. I was the flowergirl in the wedding for this particular Aunt, so I don't see how she could not even remember my name anymore.  Is it reasonable to be bothered by this?

I used to send them christmas cards (and I signed my name) but they haven't sent anything back in recent years. I don't feel like bothering to even try now. They send us things asking for money for their kids school from time to time but nothing else."
ff,"feeling betrayed
My best friend and I are dating two guys who are also best friends and roommates. At first we all got along great and had a lot of fun. Out of nowhere my best friends boyfriend started voicing how he really felt about me. He told her and my boyfriend (his best friend) that he hates me and can’t stand to be around me. He even said “seeing her is the worst part of my day.” This is only one of many many rude and uncalled for things he has said about me. He acts as though I am a nuisance when I have never done anything to him. My boyfriend and I can’t even be around them anymore because of how bad it’s gotten. It hurts that my friend allows this to happen and wants to be with someone who acts like this. It’s weighing heavily on me."
ff,"Just found out my mum is pregnant. Advice on big age gaps between siblings would be appreciated.
I have two younger sisters, and we're all really close in age (my youngest sister is 3 years younger than me), but I'm turning 20 this year. So this new baby will be 20 years younger than me. 

I'm not sure how to feel. My sisters and I are fairly close, and I'm worried that we won't be able to bond with our new sibling because of the huge age difference. We'll probably have all moved out in a few years (I've been planning on moving out this year) so we won't even get to have time to make those connections like we did with each other. It's just that it doesn't even feel real to me yet. Like if I was told that a relative or family friend was pregnant, not my own mother.

If anyone has any advice or experience with something like this I would be really grateful to hear it. Thank you."
ff,"Me [28F] and my husband [29M] don't want children. His parents disagree with our decision so much that they want him to divorce me.
For the past year, I've been weathering constant and continuous passive-aggressive attacks from my husband's parents. This issue has largely stemmed from our refusal to have children. They have also been contacting my parents, stating that they have issues with things we've said/done (mainly baby-related) and when we've tried bringing up the issue they lie and say they don't know what we're talking about and act like we're overreacting/being crazy/too sensitive. 


Recently, after his parents did and said multiple things in a short period of time, my husband tried to confront them again (not for the first time). During the conversation, his parents said some truly horrible (and in my opinion, unforgivable) things about me: They said that my refusal to have children (which my husband totally supports, and agrees with as he also doesn't want children) made me an abusive, mentally ill, toxic person and told my husband to divorce me. They also gave him an ultimatum: them or me. The conversation was not received well by my husband, and he, of course, chose me. He's very angry with his parents as they've refused to listen to and respect his wishes. 


However, they then decided to contact my parents to inform them of the mentally ill, toxic, abusive daughter that they'd raised because I wouldn't give them grandchildren. My parents, of course, were bewildered and tried to explain that we were happy, and that if we didn't want children, that decision should be respected. My husband's parents have not taken kindly to any of those suggestions.


My husband and I have been together for five years, and are coming up to being married for three. I have made it clear to everyone involved that I don't want children, and I never have. My husband agreed and has always supported and agreed with this decision. 


At the moment, no one is really speaking to anyone, and I'm taking it rather hard. It's devastating to realise that his parents only ever liked or valued me as a 'person' when I was a uterus that was potentially giving them grandchildren. To hear from my parents that they're furious that I've disrupted the plans that they had for their son upsets me on so many levels that I can't even explain properly. I am no longer sleeping or eating properly. If it were me, and they weren't my husband's parents, I would cut them completely out of my life and never speak or associate with them again. While my husband feels like this is a great solution, I also feel that they are still his parents, and no matter how angry he currently is, he's going to want a relationship in the future. My question is - how do I do? How can I try and move forward with people who literally won't accept me unless I bear them grandchildren? How can I ever let go of the fact that they've made it abundantly clear to me, my husband, and my parents, that they view me as a uterus, not a person? I want to do the right thing by my husband and be supportive, but I'm completely lost in this situation, and I have honestly no idea how to move forward. 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My in-laws won't speak to me because I don't want children. They've threatened my husband with an ultimatum (them or me) and have insisted he leaves me immediately. What do I do? What advice is there for trying to move forward - especially with people who won't address me unless I give them grandchildren?"
ff,"My friend refuses to pay his 600 dollar lost wager to me. What to do? [Long text]
One day, a friend and I started arguing about something. It turned into a heated but friendly discussion, and eventually we were both fed up with each other's differing views, so we both proposed a wager. We then spent the rest of the day simply arguing, but without any real conclusion, we decided to actually follow through with our wager. Before making the wager, we agreed on 600 dollars, and it was 100% agreed on from both sides.

Fast forward to him losing the wager and promising to pay me within a month or so when he would get his next salary. I also felt a bit bad about winning, so I decided to call him and ask him what he would have done in the exact same situation if the roles were reversed. He said he would have taken the money. Right then and there, I decided I would also then take the money, as my friend is (or so I thought) a man of honor. During no time did I ever say I didn't want the money from him.

Some time after I won, I made a little joke on facebook along the lines of: ""When am I getting my juicy money?"" with a little meme, as it would be awkward to simply tell him to pay me. He simply said: 

""I invested the money into [[fucking]] ethereum [[of all things he could have done]], and it rose 16%!
 
I probably won't pay you the money.""

I thought this was a joke, but later found out he was 100% serious. Of course this made me mad - not only that he wouldn't pay me all of a sudden, but also that he broke the news in such an arrogant way. I then argued with him, saying he owed me the money and we agreed on it as two men who made a very serious wager, both knowing what we would get ourselves into. I know for a fact that I would have paid him the second I would have lost, and I have told him so many times. He now claims that it is too much to pay, that it doesn't feel right (yet he also feels guilt) and that I am being negative and should just move on.

I get very mad at unjustice just like this, as could very well have lost the wager. I basically took a very unnecessary risk with this wager. I've told him I can't trust him anymore, but he seems to just want to move on, typing messages on Facebook like nothing has changed. He said he was sorry, but I don't accept the apology as he can still do what is right: pay me the money.

He tried twisting this on me trying to make me look greedy, when in fact he is the one who fucking scammed his friend. What is your view on this?"
ff,"Best friend of 12 years seems to be drifting
When we were in middle/high school we were inseparable. I thought she was the most amazing person to ever walk the planet. She made me feel so smart, beautiful, special, etc...I loved her so much. We went through everything together during those times and when college came around, we went to different schools. I had to work 2 jobs to keep my head above water and couldn't always make the 4-hour drive to see her as often as I wanted. She also got into drugs, which was no issue with me, but since I was never into it, I stopped getting invites to places with her (probably due to the fact I always was ALWAYS working.) We both drifted a bit in college, but then afterward we (and our SO's) moved to the same city. I was so excited to finally have a better schedule and see her as often as I could. I told her how I found God after struggling with depression and anxiety and she immediately accused me of being homophobic because I said I was Christian (born again I guess, we both grew up Catholic). Which was severely not the case. She also accused me of being so different that it's like she doesn't even know who I am anymore. I let her vent about the drifting and the differences we both grew into since middle/ high school, without even mentioning to her that she was different too, it's called growing and changing as you age, but I still loved her just the same...then I expressed how I don't want to lose her over this and we eventually squashed the beef. I know she doesn't like my boyfriend of 5 years all that much, mainly because she thinks he changed me, not taking into account that I can make my own decisions and have my own thoughts that that nothing to do with my boyfriend's. 2 years go by and during those two years, her father passes away unexpectedly. He was the light in her life and it was so painful to see everything she went through during that time. I was there for her as often as she needed me and then some. Eventually, things started to feel really one-sided. I kept ignoring it because I knew she was grieving, but after almost 2 years, it was starting to get to me. My calls and texts were hardly received, she always seemed to be in a rush to talk to me, it felt like walking on eggshells. I guess now, what really bothers me is that a friend of hers is going through a hard time with her SO and my best friend has been extremely supportive and just going above and beyond with this other girl, while all I feel like I've received from her is criticism of my relationship, my values, my political views (which she really knows almost nothing about but assumes my position). As I write this, I'm actually getting angry at how much I've been there for her, but how little she has been there for me. I'm extremely scared to bring all this up to her because she is so critical and everything she says cuts deep. It's not a good feeling, but neither is this. I don't really know what to do, and I can't imagine losing her. I would hope I can work up the confidence to tell her how I'm feeling and we can have a rational conversation about it. But I just feel really stuck."
ff,"Dude I do the right thing to have my sister on my lap
She is 22 and I am 19.. Basically and to keep the story short, she was in my lap since there was no room in the car and we were with a group of friends plus her bf and my girlfriend. Her boyfriend was driving and my girlfriend does not mind her on my lap since thats my sister.. But the others guys seemed to mind and even made jokes about her on their laps.

ff,"How to deal with indecisive parents?
My parents are unbelievably indecisive. They make every single day about making a big decision about who moves to which country and it’s horrible. 

I’ve lived in New Zealand for almost ten years now, and three years ago my dad moved back to the UK for work. Every single day my mother asks me if she and my brother should go back and join him, and if so where am I going to live?

When I was 15 I was told we were moving to Australia. I had to report this to my dean and even had to say goodbye to all my friends, only to be told (and have to sheepishly tell my friends) it was not happening after all. Now I am 21 and it does not get any easier or less embarrassing. 

I was really excited when they promised to put me in a dorm at uni this year. I went to boarding school and loved it so I was really excited; my mum even took me to Briscoes looking for dorm equipment for me for Christ’s sake. They got me worked up like this for a good three months before telling me it’s not going to happen after all. I mean it would have been fine if they had not got the idea in my head. 

I can not take it any more. It is mentally exhausting and I have spent the past 6-7 years feeling powerless and anxious. 

Does anyone else have such indecisive parents? And if so how do you deal with the 24 hour stress that you find yourself in? 

Sorry for the long post!"
ff,"Why was this guy sooo weird?
I was talking to this very weird guy online. He seemed normal at first but he quickly became very weird. He had a very weird instagram that was filled with memes and weird facts. He also said that apples were more affective at waking you up than coffee. 

He also randomly announced that he was at my school. We hung out, it was very weird. He was complaining about missing a bus most of the time and the cold. He also only wanted to talk about school. When we were texting he would respond with one word answers and never wanted to talk about anything. He didnt have any favorite tv shows and he didnt listen to music.

He was also antipot and was very judgey of people who smoked it. He only hung out with people who got good grades. 

He was just very boring and complainey. He also never drank. He was also condescending."
ff,"Fight! Fight! Fight!
Hey Reddit community, I need to know if I’m in the wrong in a certain situation...

So a friend and I, lets just call him Kevin, have been good friends for years and have always gotten along (for the most part) pretty well. Earlier this week, though, he was poking fun at me about a certain rumor he had heard about me from a mutual friend of both of ours. The rumor was completely false and out of left field, so much out of left field, that I confronted the mutual friend and asked them what the fuck they were doing. Now, this mutual friend had told my friend Kevin about this rumor and they laughed about it and he made fun of me for it in a pretty brutal, but still jokingly, manner, but decided to drag me in front of the whole squad about it before he asked me whether it was actually true or not. It still bugged me, though, that this mutual friend was talkin shit to who knows who else, spreading this false rumor and whatnot, so I decided to control this mutual friend about the rumor. The mutual friend was surprised that I confronted them about it, and complained to Kevin and thought that it was “weird” that I would confront someone who was spreading false shit about me. Now apparently this mutual friend cut ties with me (I think it’s funny and I wasn’t good enough friends with them to actually care), but Kevin is extremely angry at me and we haven’t talked to each other or about it since, making me think that things will naturally go south. I admit I may have overreacted although I don’t think I’m in the wrong, so I refuse to apologize. Any advice, Reddit community? If I believe that I truly wasn’t in the wrong, should I really apologize for how I handled this?"
ff,"Trying to start a dialogue with a friend and seeing it blow up in my face
Hi Everyone, 
First off, thank you to everyone here. I've been a long time reader but never posted. This is yet another post regarding a friend and the problems associated.

Basically, me and this guy have been friends since college, we're both in our mid-30s and entering into the next phase of our respective lives. We've always had a contentious friendship, many fights, many core disagreements, and often general dislike for one another. The solution to dealing with this has always been along the line of this: it's R, and he's an asshole, so what can you expect!

So the story in question goes like this... we're at a mutual friends wedding and he goes out of his way to ignore me and my gf, now my fiance, coming over to the group we were with and asking a question to a couple people then leaving, also practically walking by us without saying hi. It was only until I said something that he acknowledged us, which set my fiance up in flames. A few weeks later we got engaged and I texted all my friends, including R, individually with a semi copied/pasted message. It was short and sweet, but 100% honest. He doesn't reply, I left the country for vacation, and I never got his text. Turns out he did reply but more on that in a minute. 

I was upset, I sent him an email that was part deconstructive to our friendship, partly selfish, but also completely honest. I told him my feelings, how I contemplated why he didn't respond but ultimately decided that i didn't care and that I didn't need someone in my life who was going to treat me that way. By telling him these were my feelings and repeating that I wanted him to realize I was upset and I wanted to open a discussion. I never said directly ""I don't want you as a friend"" or ""you're not invited to my wedding"" but that is what he took from it. I wanted to open a dialogue, but he got really upset and angry. Also turns out he did respond to my text, a week later and said that the original text never sent, but that since his wife is pregnant he wouldn't be able to make the wedding, which is completely fine with me because the wedding is in another country. I just hated his response, it was cold and not something a friend should send to another friend regarding a wedding.

I called him out and wanted to make him see that by my standards he was not acting like a friend, but also neither was I. I had not put much effort into the friendship either. But I did say that I wanted to say these things rather than say nothing with the hopes that we could find common ground and build a foundation for something to grow in the future, which he completely ignored. 

I honestly have no idea what to do. I fear he is going to turn all our mutual friends against me, and I don't know how I am able to handle that, or if I can even handle that. My life is in a great place, but my friendships are shit, and that hurts more than I could ever imagine. To put more on top of it, his wife was having issues with a pregnancy, which he said were serious. But I heard from a mutual friend that he said she was fine. So I don't know how to react to that. I honestly don't know where to go from here. My fiance, my rock, my saving grace, is unfortunately traveling for work this month and really crazy busy. She owns her own business so it's important for her to pound the pavement and get sales, so I really don't want her to be burdened by my own bullshit. 

I can send anyone the email discussion in a PDF if you want to read it. Hopefully someone can help."
ff,Did I handle this situation okay with my friend?
ff,"IDK WHAT TO DO ANYMORE
AH IM IN SUCH A DILEMMA. Basically I have this friend whom I’ve known for 10+ years and we’ve always been quite different but were good friends nonetheless. Over the past 3 years this friends true colours have been slowly creeping out and its been really affecting me! Most recently she did some that was way out of line and really made me question who she is! I’ve tried cutting her out slowly and distancing myself but I can’t really escape it since our university campuses are the same and she’s recently joined a club I’m in! She’s basically just so fake around me and is so nice to everyone else and I ignore it and let it slide but the thing she did that was way out of line is something I can’t get over? She also always makes me feel guilty for what I have and always makes me out to be just ‘lucky’ but nothing I have ‘have’ is due to luck! It’s literally pure hard work??? And now that she’s joining this club it’s gonna make things 1000x worse because she’s just going to show off to all the guys and be this super fake ass person? She thinks she can get away with it and basically try walk all over me just because she’s known me for ages cause otherwise she literally follows everyone else like a sheep? I’ve tried confronting her about her actions but she just laughs it off??? How can I just get over it all ready?? It’s really beginning to affect my mental health 😭 like I didn’t really speak either her over the last 2 months and I’ve never been happier but seeing her around college more literally makes my blood boil she’s honestly just so toxic and I feel like hanging with her in this club is going to ruin my reputation and what others think of me! I just don’t want to be associated with her anymore 😭😭"

ff,"New friends
Hi,

I’m new here. I have a huge problem. 
It’s extremely hard for me to trust people I have a bond with (friends). Out of fear of rejection or disapproval for my actions, I don’t dare to become closer. I fear people will leave me eventually, so the idea that I have friends, isn’t present. When it is present, I feel like I need to stay in touch very often. 
I feel reluctant to take initiative often. If I don’t get asked for something, it’s a strong sign I’m not wanted. This has become standardized.
I have some vague friends, but they live far away. We can’t that close, don’t share many interests, but we like each other. We can’t meet up often. 

What can I do to find new friends and do regularly something in my neighborhood. I’m close to a city, but I live in a village. I’m all day home (except for school and such), don’t feel energized to take action. Sigh. 
Getting advice like ‘find a sport, hobby, club’ doesn’t help much, I get suck. 
I feel like I don’t have even insight in the process of making friends. Or I’m not wanted. I feel like something is going wrong every time, but I don’t know what. 

Thanks in advance."
ff,"Not good enough.
Greetings, everyone. I am currently in need of venting my thoughts. Reddit seems like the perfect environment for fucked up people, like myself. I've come for the wisdom and maybe even the charming assholes. So, here's the scoop:

Growing up, I was always compared to a specific relative. I won't say which, because I'm a paranoid fucker. But we shared the same gender, were of similar ages, and were always very different from each other. Still, we were extremely close. The biggest difference was our weight. Yes, I was always the ""larger"" one. People enjoyed to point it out, but what really stung was that our own family would as well. Fast forward to years later, when we were in our teenage years. It became so much more than our weight. Our family started comparing our physical appearances. They were always the more ""attractive"" one. The more ""successful"" one. We are both adults now. Our grandmother speaks wonders of this person, and only has negative things to say about me. Despite all of this, I was always deemed the ""nicer"" one. That hasn't mattered a single bit. I constantly beat myself for picking up the phone when our grandmother calls, because I give her personal details of my life only for her to turn around and use it as juicy gossip material. She is very sick, and I assume quite close to death. I pick up because I feel massive guilt when I ignore her calls, while my ever-so-""better"" relative ignores them with no problem, and is still worshipped. I've considered cutting ties with my entire family. I don't believe they genuinely care about me. Yeah, I'm struggling. Bad. I'm basically at rock bottom right now. Still, I highly doubt my wellbeing is in their best interest at all. I don't think I'll ever be the picture perfect grandchild, child, sibling, whatever. It drowns me deep in self-loathing every day."

ff,"Mom always trying to ask me uncomfortable questions and gets mad when I express my feelings about them
I'm 20 years old and I've been with my boyfriend a little over 2 years. I know I'm young. Will my relationship last forever? There's a good chance it won't because both of us are very young. However, that doesn't mean I don't know how to be in a relationship or know if I love someone or not.

My mom has a bad habit of asking really odd, seemingly disrespectful questions to me and my brother about our relationships. A popular one she gives me is ""I don't think you love him, he's more like you friend."" She asked me this tonight over a phone call and I got upset with her and expressed how I feel uncomfortable and disrespected when she tells me things like that. Like she know's everything about my relationship, somehow, when I hardly tell her anything about it because her and my dad are quite old fashioned and very religious. She's told me things like this many times before, and usually I try to just try to brush it off, but I'm trying to get her to understand and communicate better with me and my brother.  She went on to say say ""but i'm your mom, I can ask things like that."" I understand she has a much different point of view, especially because she's older, but I just personally feel it's disrespectful to say that I don't love my boyfriend and that ""he's just a friend."" She kind of rolled her eyes at me, flatly said goodnight, and hung up.

Am I overreacting? i feel like I shouldn't be guilty for expressing my feelings of being uncomfortable with the questions she asks me. My parents have both lacked communication skills my whole life, and it's put us in a rocky relationship. I love my mom, but I'm just trying to get her to understand modern day relationships and me as pretty much a grown adult. Thoughts?"
ff,"I hate my mum
I dislike my mum. In fact, I’m disgusted with her and feel rage sometimes. She acts fake towards me, meanwhile behind my back, she complains and gossips about me. She hates when I talk to my dad at all because she thinks we’re rivalling against her which isn’t true. When I confront her with things she’s said, she says, ‘I never said that. Stop pinning me down. You’re lying. I never lie. I’m perfect.’ And she is religious. This one year I asked if I could see a therapist and she refused until I told her my reasons which she was the reason mainly. Then I told her something else and then she would deliberately ignore me and get mad every time I’d ask again. Until like, 1 year went by and she said I have to have a therapist who is the same religion which I’m not even. She went psycho this one year and yelled, slapped my older sister, threw plates at all of us until we’d run outside to our backyard. And I’ve tried being honest with her. I told her I had some serious trouble at school with bullying and she knew who it was and said to me, ‘they’re always nice to me. I don’t believe you.’ And she never talks with me about how I’m doing or even made dinner when I was younger so I’m still underweight. And she gets mad at every honest thing I say because I’m just kinda frank. My oldest sister has rebelled against her and stuff but yet, she still is a heartless person. And when I’m away from ‘home’ she won’t ever text or call me and then when I return ‘home’ she’ll yell at me and accuse and manipulate me. She’ll say, ‘is it really that hard to send a text?!’ Meanwhile she never does. And she manipulated my dad and ever since I was 7, she’s wanted to divorce my dad and it’s sad because my family is so split, all my dad wants is to just have dinner as a family but that’s too hard. And my ‘mum’ blames my dad for the split of the family. I hate my mum, don’t care about my older sister, but I like my oldest and younger sister and my dad."
ff,"Imminent Death of a Loved One
So let me start by saying I’ve been fortunate enough to have never lost a family member or really close friend, so this is all foreign to me.  My grandpa has had cancer for quite a while and it’s getting worse. Whenever I visit it’s something that is never really talked about and he seems to not really want to talk about it and doesn’t really let any of us know what is going on and down plays the situation. Recently I’ve picked up on several indicators that lead me to believe the end is near. I don’t really know what the best thing to do is, but I know one thing and that’s that I don’t want to miss any moments, let him down in his last days or regret anything for the rest of my life. He has lived a long and extraordinary life and has so many stories and so much wisdom. One thing is that I want to be able to tell my future kids about him and carry on that legacy after he passes and there are many stories that I can’t myself recite and many that I am sure that I haven’t even heard. I guess what I’m looking for is maybe someone who has gone through this sort of thing and can share maybe some things that they did or wish they would’ve done before their loved one passed away. Two things kind of come to mind but I don’t know how to bring it up. Maybe to have him write some things down in a journal or to record something. I’m also just open to hearing anyone else’s stories.

Thanks in advance"
ff,"Are my friends leaving me out on purpose?
This has been bugging me for a while, I mean I've gotten to the point where I've made a Reddit account to vent about it. So I'm on of those girls who has two best friends, I'm sure you can already see where this is headed (I'll call them Susie and Amy). 

When I started secondary school I didn't have any friends since I had joined out with my school catchment area. Although, I met Susie and she quickly became my best friend. We were in a big group of girls which included Amy. Amy and Susie had become close since they lived near each other and had had lots of sleepovers and days out together and stuff. I had made friends with a girl called Ruby who was Amy's best friend at the time and eventually Amy and Ruby fell out, causing the group to split up and because I was closer to Susie, I went with her. 

This left Amy, Susie, and I to form a little ""squad"" and the three of us were extremely close for the next three years. Some things happened with Susie which resulted in Amy and I falling out with her for about 10 months. Nothing big, just usual girly bitching and drama. Amy and I became extremely close during this time but something Amy told me really hurt. 

When we were in the process of making up with Susie, Susie had told Amy that she considered Amy to be the closest person to her. That couldn't be right? I went to Susie's house every Friday? I helped her out with her chores whenever I was over, I stayed over almost every weekend, I went on trips with her and her family all the time, we sat next to each other in almost every class, we constantly texted and called and she wouldn't hesitate to tell me every detail of her life and problems and neither would I. Amy had a job and was always working weekends, she was also never the type to text people or even call since she was always with her sister. So why did Susie consider her closer? It really stung but I got over it. 

My issue now is that since the three of us have made up I can't help but feel a little excluded. I'll only give one example since everything's of a similar nature. 

We've been off school for the past three days because of the snow. I saw that Susie was at Amy's house on the first day, I was a little bummed about not being invited but I brushed it off since it could've just been a spontaneous visit. But Susie is at Amy's Mothers house today, I'm assuming she's staying over, and it's not like I live an hour away. I live a 15 minute walk away, it would only take 5 minutes to get a lift there and the snow isn't bad anymore. So...did I do something to warrant not being invited? Usually Amy would always invite me over, we would have loads of sleepovers...

And y'know to top it all off, my Grandma passed away on Tuesday, Susie had met my grandma and visited her with me a lot and even though I had told her what happened she messaged me later to ask why I seemed sad, only to act shocked and say she 'never realised' that my grandma had died even though I had already told her. Amy knew my grandma had died too but she hasn't said a word to cheer me up. These girls aren't awkward or unsympathetic either, they've taken care of me when someone has passed away before. Are they being like this on purpose? 

TL;DR 
Close friends I've had for years are excluding me, is it on purpose or by accident?"
ff,"A friend cut me off
So recently a friend of mine cut me off and I’m not really sure why. I guess to understand my concern it would be best to get the whole story. 
I had first met her earlier this school year. Our desks were right next to each other in math class. Back then, she was very talkative, sociable, optimistic, and energetic around me. I’m not always the most talkative type but that didn’t seem to bother her at all. She always shouted for my attention to say hi to me when passed each other in the halls. She asked for my number, introduced me to a few of her friends, and even invited me over to her house for lunch during one of our off periods. We texted a couple times though I will admit each time I kept feeling like I was annoying her. 
Eventually, she had invited me to come with her boyfriend and group of friends to hang out at the mall over Christmas vacation. I was so excited. However, when the day finally came, I couldn’t help but feel like a third wheel. She was much more focused on her boyfriend than she was on anyone else and the only time she noticed me was when I had wandered off without telling any of them. That wasn’t cool of me, I admit, but I just didn’t feel needed or even wanted there at times. Later that night though, I texted her and apologized for not being that social but she it was all fine. 
But I still couldn’t shake the feeling that she was upset with me. When we came back from vacation, my suspicions grew. She was a lot more quiet and distant from me and was usually on her phone with her headphones in whenever I was around. It was around this time that I started to become a lot more needy. She still responded to my texts and told me that the reason she was so quiet was because she had a headache. But I couldn’t help but notice that she was still pretty social around her other friends. At one point when we were walking in the halls, she had her headphones in and didn’t say a word to me but the minute she saw one of her other friends, she took her headphones out and screamed for his attention. All while I was standing right next to her. 
It was a week before winter vacation when we got into an argument. You see, she was aware of my depression and offered her assistance in helping me deal with it. However, in our argument, she expressed her displeasure with how she felt she was putting in all the effort into dealing with my problems. I tried apologizing to her, probably getting a bit too dramatic about it, but she just expressed her annoyance at how I constantly needed her assurance and that if I don’t try to change myself, she won’t be my friend anymore. Eventually, I apologized for my part in the argument and how I didn’t make her help feel appreciated, but I also explained to her that I was doing something about my depression. I see a psychiatrist and take antidepressants every night. Still, she insisted that I needed to change. But by this point, whenever I spoke to her in person, she always seemed disinterested and kind of annoyed. When I asked her if she had a problem with me, she would always say that she was either busy or wasn’t in the mood for it. Eventually, she responded that she needed space for the whole vacation, so I didn’t text her at all. But when the vacation was over, I tried to text if everything was fine now only to discover that she had blocked my number. Now, she doesn’t even acknowledge my presence anymore and almost seems to actively avoid me. 
I apologize if this is really long. I just wanted to be as detailed as possible. At this point, I just feel at a loss and confused about what happened. I’m not sure if I did something wrong or if she was ever my friend at all. I mean, our friendship felt genuine those first months before Christmas. But now I just don’t know what to think or do."
ff,"Help me figure this out
So I’m a single mom I left my boyfriend because of us arguing all the time. He has my son two days out of the week and for his birthday I gave him three to be nice (there’s a reason I don’t want him having more bc he can not handle stress) but when he dropped my son off he told me he now wants him for a week meaning I have my son one week and he gets the other but I don’t want that because I think it would be too stressful for my 10 month old so I told him I’ll take him to court which the father does not want . Things have smoothed over but I still want to go to court so this arguing over days will stop but I do not want to fuck myself over due to not having a job . I live with my mom and have a stable household but having him 5 days out of the week it’d be hard for me to get a job that will work with me . If we go to court I’d allow him three days that way I can get a decent amount of work time but if I go to court without having a job or a car would that fuck me over and give the father more time ? Any thoughts or insight would greatly help and be appreciated"
ff,"Made grandma feel old XD
Setting of this story is morbid but this is my favorite memory with my grammy.

I'm about to turn 22 and this took place back in November of 2017. My family lives all along Western Washington and we don't see each other often, so it was bittersweet to see everyone at my great grandmothers funeral. My cousins and I sat together at one end of the table when we all went to lunch after at a fancy restaurant with our moms next and then grandparents. Only two of us kids are old enough to drink, me and my 28 year old cousin. No one blinked an eye when he ordered an Irish coffee. But then the baby (me) ordered a rum and coke.

This resulted in two things.
1. My mom and cousin laughing at me because my original order was for Southern Comfort and coke and they said I drink  poor people booze (I'm 21 fresh out of college what do you expect)
2. My grandmother nearly had a heart attack when she even heard me utter that I wanted alcohol.

What made this even funnier was when I got my drink and she mentioned to my mom how she keeps forgetting I'm not 16 anymore."
ff,"is it ever okay to stay friends with your best friend's ex?
i'm sort of confused. my best friend's ex invited me to a group outing and i'm not sure if it's right. he also invited my best friend (she said no) and he acts like he has no respect to what happened between them. my best friend though is really upset although they broke up a while ago. what should i do, morally?"
ff,"Living At Home With Untrustworthy Family Member
This post may be a bit long, but I really need advice , outside of the obvious ""just move out"" , which I will be doing soon, but I need advice for until I do.

So I live at home with an untrustworthy uncle who has shown me that I can't trust him. He talks about people behind their back, personally talks down to me, purposely does things to hold me back (such as will place a setback in my way knowing it will affect my moving out --- he asks me to drive someone somewhere using my car during the time I have to be at work, ect.) .

Anyway,  my uncle wants me to contribute to the household by paying $50.00 towards the electric bill. So I go, ""Ok, no problem.""

That is a big problem because I was initially thinking I could go to a bill payment center and just directly pay it there as my debit card company (AMEX, Visa, ect) isn't accepted by the electric company. I called the electric company and was told if I go to a billpayment center that I need the bill or at least the account number. I have neither and am unable to access either because my uncle takes the bill . I have asked to see it, both asking my aunt and uncle. 
My aunt says ""I am trying to complicate things,"" and informed me that my uncle pays everything via his bank account,which really means to ""contribute"", I am really having to pay my uncle $50 after he pays the whole bill from his bank account. 

I don't want to do that because I am looking at having to give him that $50 , which is really going in his pocket, versus to the electric company, as a waste of money. I want to be sure my money is going where it is supposed to go (to the electric bill, and not in my uncle's pockets).  When my sister lived here, they let her have access to the bills and pay them or parts of them how she wanted.  We are two years apart, her being 28, and me being 26.  My uncle wastes a lot of money on hookah, and products on Amazon. He believes that my grandmother's house is his house (which is not true at all.) 

They, being my uncle and aunt are not allowing me to do things the way I want. I want to ensure that my money is going directly to the electric company in particularly because when I have contributed to the household as they (my aunt and uncle) have asked, I have watched my money be used in an unscrupulous manner and have had to deal with them (my aunt and uncle) basically monopolizing my time, so I can never progress with what I need to do in life, such as move out. My aunt tried to ask me how much money I bring in a month, and I refused to tell her. In my family, my family feels like if you are not forthcoming with information then something shady or bad has to be going on. In my case, that is not true. I am a young woman wanting to better herself and continue pursuing her passions (ones that actually will provide for myself and my OWN family --- children, ect if I have any) and leave a legacy behind when my time comes.  I am thinking not of just today, but later on down the line. 

My uncle is very immature. While his mother (my grandmother) was in the hospital due to a heart attack and stroke, he brought a random woman over and had sex with her in his mother's bed, and the girl was very loud and disrespectful considering that I am right down the hall. (Keep in mind, he has his own room on the third floor of the house where no one would be able to hear or see anything he is doing). He also has a superiority complex. 

My grandmother is still sick, and is supposedly coming home soon. I am trying to save so I can move, and have been the one helping my grandmother while she is sick. I am aware that I am dealing with a toxic family member (well, family members.) 

My uncle will downtalk me, calling me a bum, saying I don't have certain things, because he doesn't see where any of my money is at or goes (He isn't supposed to, I am a grown adult) , but at the same time, putting every road block in my way to keep me in a position where I can't get on better footing. I honestly feel my family just wants someone that they can talk about and put down. I have told my family that I don't have access to cash, so I can continue to save and move. I did say I can contribute in other ways. I have been the pariah of my family due to what a lot of people have said about me, lies and things that are untrue. I have family members that just want me to fail. I know that for sure.

 I have thought about waiting for next month's bill to come, and taking the account number off of it to directly pay my portion of the electric bill. 

To anyone who feels I may be being selfish, complaining , or lazy,  I am none of those things. I am currently working and saving money to move to another state. I was taught at an early age to trust my gut, and everything is all messed up right now. I have watched my family and am aware of how they operate. I don't want to be around people I can't trust. Family will betray you faster than your enemies. 

I am asking regarding this situation, what should I do and what advice do you suggest for dealing with toxic family members who make fun of your dreams and put obstacles in your way to hold you back from succeeding ? Also getting the account number off of the bill after the bill comes --- how good of an idea is that?"
ff,"I cut off my best friend because she was a flake NOW she wants me back ( Am I wrong for declining?)
**TLDR**: I cut off my Best friend of 5 years for being flakey and unreliable this summer. She tries to guilt trip me into taking her back. She bought me a gift while visiting in Korea and wanted to give it to me this Saturday. I said ok at first but sent her a text this morning declining the gift and the offer. I feel guilty. Am I wrong? 


**Long Story (detailed)**:   
      
   My friend and I had been friends since high school ( I am now 23 and she is now 21). I ended our friendship this summer after giving her numerous chances over the years. Long story shortish, she would never keep her word when it came to meeting up, she was super inconsistent and only really reached out when it was convenient for her. She would always be ""too busy"", she'd change our plans to hang out with others, or she'd flake out all together and not call or show. We both went to separate colleges in different towns so meeting up was hard and hanging out regularly was pretty difficult. I was always the one who would reach out to see how she was doing and I was always the one to initiate are hang out sessions. We would make plans to meet up a month in advance and the week of our planned day, she would flake out. After a while, I started calling her out and she would beg and cry exclaiming that she would change, but she never did. I would text her and she'd never text back. I called her once after a hard day at school and she rushed me off the phone but whenever she would call me for help and advice I was always there front and center ready to listen. I would ask her to help me out and she bail at the last minute due to scheduling conflict or her failing to think ahead. I once asked her to pick me up from the airport. I asked 3 times if she was sure if she could and she reassured me that she'd be able to. A couple of days before the day that she was supposed to pick me up, she calls me talking in circles only to tell me that she couldn't do it. I was broke and couldn't really afford a lyft. Luckily I was able to reach my dad. 
      

  Over the summer things got even worse. She turned 21 and I had tried several times to link up and take her out. She bailed both times. The first time she bailed because I guess she forgot that she needed to pick up her aunt from the airport. The second time she made date night plans with her boyfriend. It continued to persist. she was teaching me how to drive but didn't think enough of me to let me know when she was going to cancel. Instead, she ghosted me for a week only to blame it on the fact that she was too busy to text me or call me. 
      In September, I had had it! I deleted her on facebook and i blocked her number. She added me back a week later and then I blocked her. Feeling bad, November I reached out one last time to see if we could talk things through. She said that she missed me and was too sad to talk in person and that she need time to process what happened. I rolled my eyes at the text and said whatever. Toward the end of the month (November 19th to exact) she reaches out to me telling me about how sorry she is how awful of a friend she was. I vented my frustrations and she said apologized and alluded to wanting yet another chance. I said ok and we planned to meet on December 22nd. 
      

   A few days before December 22nd, she texts me saying that the 22nd didn't work for her. She tried to place the blame on me by saying that I knew that she had job training that day and that I should've picked another day. I went off, She begs, I say whatever. Sometime goes by and we talk again and I explain everything that is on my mind. I tell her that its cool to be busy but its also important to make time for the people in her life. She didn't really respond because I guess it was finals week on her end. I told her that I would always be there for her and I wished her the best of luck.
       

On New Years she texted me telling me that she had been thinking about me and she wished me a Happy New Year. I did the same. A few days later she texts me saying that she bought me a gift in Korea (where she had been visiting) and I said ok? I was a little irritated because I know that it was just another nice-nice sappy guilt trip manipulation ploy. We settled for meeting up on Saturday. however after thinking about it, I texted her today and told her that meeting up isn't a good idea. I told her that while she is a very sweet person and that I appreciated the gift, I do not trust her. I told her that I have since moved on and healed from the situation. I included that if she wanted to speak on the phone on Saturday that we could but outside of that I would not feel comfortable meeting up and hanging out. She texted me back a little short saying ""Oh ok"" and she asked if she could text me later. I said sorry and told her to take care. 
   

  *Am I wrong? I feel a little guilty for how messy this entire thing has been but Im over feeling used and manipulated. She thinks that if she ""gives"" me gifts and or cries and begs for me to give her another chance that I give in. I mean it this time.. Ive gone back on my word so many times with her because of guilt and not wanting to seem like a bitch. She doesnt have many friends and I was kind of her should but she always had a hard time returning the favor. Should I meet up with her and accept the gift? Or should I just let sleep dogs lie???*"
ff,"FIL & BIL literally make themselves at home when they visit
I like my home to look nice when guests come over. Sometimes I’ll have a lightly scented candle on in the bathroom or hallway or I’ll turn on a lamp to light up my entryway. The kitchen is always set buffet style to make it easy for everyone to serve themselves. I always make sure to make my guest bedroom is welcoming. Like fluffy pillows, comfy comforter, extra linens, working tv. You get the idea. 

Whenever my FIL comes to visit it irks TF out of me when he makes these little adjustments while he’s here. I recently noticed that he’ll blow out the candle in the bathroom. Like WTF?! I know this cause I went in there before and after him once. He’ll also just randomly walk over to turn off my hallway lamp when he’s only been here for like 20 minutes. A few years ago, when he lived with us for a minute he rearranged my guest bedroom AND would rearrange everything around in my kitchen! I’m like wtf, I like my keurig right where it is! Thank you! 

Another wtf, we have a sectional that sits about 7-8 people comfortably when FIL/Bro IL come over they insist on spreading out and lay across the whole damn thing. Do they offer me a seat when I come over? No. It’s only until my bf scoots over to make room for me so I can squeeze in to sit somewhere at the end of the couch. 

Oh and bro in law? He always makes sure we know he eats gluten free. FYI he is NOT allergic to gluten and insists that “If the package doesn’t say Gluten Free it’s not gluten free.” Everyone knows not to start that argument with him,  there’s no point. Even if I mention that if my friend who has celiac disease can eat something it’s gluten free. He just shakes his head like idk what I’m talking about.

I don’t really say anything cause for 1 FIL is old and for 2 they are both only over a couple times a month. What’s the point anyway when I forget all about it the following day? They’re here for the SuperBowl and I’m aggressively writing this as I’m squished into the corner of my own couch. Would you guys even say anything? What would you say or do? And how much longer is the super bowl?!"
ff,"Gossiping in the family
Hello. I am not sure whether this fits in this sub but I am going to ask it anyway. My family is a known gossiper. All of them tend to gossip about me. I am the odd ball, the one who doesn't agree with them. The one they all tend to chat about. Many times we have arguments, they all gain up on me. I will have my mom, dad, and older sisters all attacking my character- telling me I am no good and that I am poison . I have caught them in a few instances; but they brush it off. Often, they pretend I am being paranoid or they play dumb and be like, ""I did nothing, we said nothing."" Sometimes they complain about someone else to use it to get to me. It's really bothersome. It makes me feel so betrayed, confused, and really angered. I also not my family learns things about me before I even told them- mainly negative. There are lists of inconsistent gaps. I try to confront them but they immediately dismiss me. They try to cover up their tracks and always tell me I am paranoid. I know lots of the advice will be to confront them, but I do not believe that will work. I have tried that- all kinds of approaches but they insist they did nothing even when I catch them saying things about me. My mother does it the most. Often she, gossips after work with my sisters or sometimes with my dad. Sometimes my sisters gossip about me together. I have become the play thing in the family- my problems and life is just a giant joke they can share their contempt for. It's hurts. It's hard not to give a shot because it's your own family. I have considered audio recording secretly but that is creepy and invades their privacy despite they do that with me often. It's also wrong to play the same game. What should I do? I really am at a loss."
ff,"Mother is always trying to start something.
My mom and I have a rocky relationship, I love my mom but sometimes I absolutely cannot stand her or the things she does. It stems from her depression that she has, but she always blames everything in the world for her problems and never herself. Yesterday, she texted me that my grandparents were moving from our hometown they've lived in since the 80's and to the town where more of our family lives. I sent a picture of my discount card from my job and said they could use it if they needed to buy boxes or moving supplies. She replied with ""That's it no emotion?"" Should I have been more emotional to the situation? I don't blame my grandparents for moving because I moved out of state last year. I don't care what my grandparents decide to do because it's their decision to move. I don't blame them for moving at all."
ff,"Awful Friend Trying to Reunite Friend Group
I have this friend, let's call him G, and he was a part of a friend group that I brought together. To make a long story short, he got bored, and (admittedly) lied about me to them, then when he found out they didn't like him as much as they liked each other, he ran back to me. I let him be my friend again, and he outed me as bi to my religious summer camp, which I then had to leave. He came back 3 months later saying he was going to therapy and he realized what he did wrong and was trying to get better, so we kept distant contact, but I found out last week he was still friends with the people he lied to (who are now gossiping about me and trying to convince my friends to end their friendships with me). I told him I was done being friends with him because he constantly endangers me or puts me in uncomfortable positions, and he called me crying about how he just wishes things were ""like they were in freshman year"" and that he ""should have never lied to them"". I hung up. He messaged me this morning asking me to meet up with our old friend group over spring break. I don't know what to do. I want my friends back but I'm scared they will hurt me again."
ff,"Is my friend a narcisist?
I have this ""friend"" who I find kinda annoying.
Because of my not so social nature I am used to being the third wheel, but this person, let's call him ""Eric"", seems to have me as an option.

Now, we met each other due to a drama club where I managed to get myself into a script writing role, he wanted in. Me being an innocent 11 year old at the time, I didn't think much of it.

Now, 17, here are a few factors that lead me to believe the title:

1) I dont care about what other people think of me. Whenever he can he always speaks to his other friends, let's call him ""Mark,""

Mark doesn't like conflict and therefore listens to everyone. I am his secondary option.


2) Whenever I do better than him at something he always tries to make himself seem better and that I just got lucky.

He says things like:

""You just used 10 more minutes, so you did worse""

""You always get lower or equal to the mark I get.""

3) he tries to get me to adapt to him by saying things like:

""Did you really choose that haircut? Its bad""

Or

""I am dissapointed in you""

And

""We're soul-friends"" (trying to make me agree with him)


4) He is always butting into conversations with my other friends, trying to pull me away from them

5) He tries to convince me that I'll do better at life with him rather than anyone else.


Again, I don't take any of this to heart and generally just ignore him, but should I make it clear that I know what hes doing, or am I just being paranoid?"
ff,"My friends ended up voting for the other guy in the end. Should I feel betrayed or pissed?
They campaigned for me and shared everything with me. Nothing bad had happened among us, the other candidate was a friend and a good boy though. They ended up voting against me. I don't even know how to deal with them in the future or if I should blame myself for everything. I am dispaired.

ff,"Leapfrogger/Friend Stealer/Friend Poacher etc.
Just for some context in my form group (like a morning register class or a house class as some call it) I sat at a table with people I didn't really talk to, but since I couldn't change seats I decided to make some friends with people at the table.

In grade/year 8 or 9 I met two guys who are now great friends of mine, one I talk to more than the other since he stayed at home instead of at school due to health issues. Fast forward a few months and you have the situation above. So I started talking about a common interest with this guy we shall name Manny, now Manny and I only talked in form, and after I would go back to my main social circle with my best mate. After a while (about grade 9-10 maybe) I decided Manny should go and chat with me and my best mate's social circle for once, so introduced them both to each other, and they got on well.

Now between year 10-11 I definitely noticed that Manny started taking more of my best mates interest, which makes sense and happens often so I didn't think of it. It only caught my attention when my best mate stopped inviting me to events such as hangouts at the park and going on cinema trips with my other friend who stays at home. Instead he would invite Manny and Manny would invite him and some of my other friends to many events like the cinema and sleepovers and whatnot. Over time I would be completely excluded from my friends activities and everytime invited them to do something, they would say ""im not sure if i can go"" only for me to find out they went with Manny somewhere.

Sure we are all still friends but I feel like i'm being slowly excluded. Is this just me? What do you all think?"

I have such a judgemental family, they all speak about each other and criticise everything you do. I’m fed up with being controlled and having judgements made about me.

ff,"I News Your advice
Hi, I’m 18. 

my mom passed away three years ago, now  I live with my dad who’s a wonderful dad and I really love him but there’s this situation that I don’t know how to handle :

He got involved into a sex club or something like  50 shades of gray, I don’t know exactly what it is but I know that many women send him naked pictures and he is like a master, he tortures them sexually and they accept. 

I know he’s been involved with that for a long time, even when he was married with my mom, but he doesn’t know I know all that. 

One day I asked him to answer me sincerely what was that, or just say nothing if he didn’t want to. He lied to me but I said nothing. 

Today I found by mistake a bag of women underwear with panties in My home I left it open so he’ll know I saw it. Should I confront him ? What should I say ? I’m really scared 😟"

ff,"Abusive dad or I'm just toxic...
Two weeks ago, my dad lost our dog. It went to the shelter but due to the microchip ownership issue, we have to wait two weeks to get her. I told my family that there's a chance that we might not get the dog back. 


My dad then started saying how it's fate that the dog is gone and that if we can't get it back then it's destiny. I got annoyed and said ""But really, it's because you weren't being careful and you left her at the park"". He then started yelling at me. Saying he's the only one who walks the dog. I then said I walk the dogs as well, I just don't do it enough because I'm the only one in the family who works from morning to night, paying for the bills, groceries and everything. 


He then claimed that it's not his fault and then started saying how if someone told him to look after their child and he accidently killed it, would it be his fault. I responded with yes, it is your fault because it's under your duty of care. Anyway, things got ugly from there.



I didn't speak to him for a week. He got my sister to ask me to pay for his bills and fines. I paid for the $500 one today this morning. Then he asked to borrow my car, and I lent it to him. After that, he came back and started throwing passive jabs at me by talking to the dog. 

e.g. ""Bailey, you're lucky that I'm here. If i wasn't here, you would've died a long time ago. Some people just know how to talk and don't do shit."" 

I got annoyed and said you lost the dog. Get over it. He then yelled at me. I got annoyed and told him to fuck off. He then started saying ""wow, you're being so disrespectful. God will punish you. I wish you die and I wish you'll live out your life alone."" 

I then said ""You came home and started a fight for no reason. Don't play the victim when I argue back"". 

He then said ""I'm just talking to myself. You don't have to listen to me.""

I then said ""Go talk to the wall then."" I shut the door and continue with my business.

He then walked next to my door and started going on and on about how I'll die soon for being disrespectful and that god will send a lightning bolt to hit me. I then angrily snapped at him saying ""I may or may not die before you, but I can bet that if you die, no one in this fucking world would mourn for you"".

I then shut the door, and I didn't hear anything from him again. 


Not sure if I have a abusive father or I'm just toxic or maybe it's both. I don't want to live like this anymore."
ff,"Husband in hospital and I am at a complete loss
Hi all long time lurker first time poster. Using a throw away since it would destroy my husband if he saw this. I am on mobile and a bit sleep deprived, so sorry for the format or dreaded grammar errors. TLDR at bottom. 

Honestly I don’t need advice I just need to let everything out now before i explode. And (un)fortunately my husband is my best friend leaving me feeling alone with no one to talk to.  I have a 20month old and am 35 weeks pregnant. My husband for the last few weeks has been feeling nauseous and out of sorts. I finally convinced him to go to a redicare. Well those jerks turned him away since they can’t help with abdominal pain. I wasn’t with him or they would have seen him. He ended up going to another urgent care. There they realized he had a bp of 220/112. First annoyance if the first place took his vitals we could have headed straight to the ER. We met up and got him there right away. We were at the ER for several hours before they made the decision to admit him to the cardiac unit of the hospital. Since then they have discovered a kidney issue and have not gotten a handle on the bp.  They have no answers but seem to be coming up with more questions. He isn’t even 30 so the fact this is happening is extremely bizarre. 

His mother was here to help, but I am at my wits end and needed to be alone this evening. We just moved our daughter to a toddler bed Saturday which is doing great at night but she hasn’t napped in 3 days. She is crabby and obviously confused since daddy isn’t home. She is also in a phase where hitting mommy is funny. She hit me today and I just burst into tears. Which according to my mil is my hormones which really helped the situation.  I can’t sleep and am vomiting from pregnancy and stress. I know I have to be strong for her and him and unborn, but I am failing. I spent 2 hours tonight just crying. I keep losing my temper with my daughter. I wish I could be at the hospital with him. I feel stranded, alone and useless. I don’t know how I can help him. He is spiraling down into a pit of depression and I have no way of helping him out. I keep calling and texting him which I can tell he doesn’t want. 

We are going to visit tomorrow morning then my mom is going to come here tomorrow so I can go see him again without the little one. But I haven’t been home much the past 2 days and I know it is taking a toll on her. I just recently became a stay at home which has created separation anxiety issues. I feel torn between to 2 people who mean the world to me and I am failing both of them. 

If you made it this far I guess the only question I have is does anyone have experience with this and how can I help him and her get through this?


TLDR: Husband has crazy high bp and hospitalized. I feel like I am failing helping him and my toddler get through this. I feel like I have no one to talk to. Being 35 weeks pregnant is not making anything easier."
ff,"My bestie guilt trips me constantly
My best friend moved to the other side of Canada. Anyone who knows anything about North American geography knows that Canada is effing huge and so it's expensive to travel that far west. 

I've planned a really awesome solo backpacking trip to Southeast Asia. Five countries in 13 weeks. Anyway, when she found out, she was pissed I'm not spending that money on going out to see her instead. And she said something like ""if I had any extra cash I'd be using it to come see you""... Which makes me feel like absolute crap. She clearly doesn't understand wanderlust... I wanna see other cultures and it's just not the same to travel within your own country. Anyway, after she said that I snapped and said I'm done with her guilt trips. This is just one example of her pulling this kind of thing. 

Did I do the right thing?"
ff,"How to stop being friend with a person that i'm envious of ??
Hi...

I'm a university student who befriend with a person who also study in the same university as me as well as enrolling in the same bachelor degree. 

When i befriend with this person, i just feel a lot of inconveniences and jealousy in my life. Honestly, i often feel envy of his high scores, actually sometimes i even help him to do an assignment (like sending him a copy of my assignment) which annoyingly also makes him get a higher score than me. 

He is a good guy, but i just really don't want to befriend with him anymore because of this kind of inconveniences and jealousy. I know, maybe some of you see me as the ""Toxic Friend"" or the ""Bad Guy"" here, but, i don't really care. The question is... How to stop being friend with this person in a gradual way ?? If i stop helping him in doing assignments, will it help me to break this friendship ??"
ff,"Need advice on a friendship!
Need advice on a friendship!So I’ve written on here a few times about this crush I had on this straight guy I worked with at work for a little over 6 months or so. To summarize it, in those short months or so we became friends I guess u can say. We both are a year apart, he likes sports, music, and video games, etc. Anyways I developed a crush on him and I couldn’t handle the fact it would never happen, so I said to myself to try and make this friendship something memorable. We hung out 3 times outside of work, the third time was kind of quick but it was still outside of work and it happened last Friday, which I loved not only was I trying to catch up with him since we hadn’t hung out since December and it’s already March. So to put in perspective, I know it’s long but bear with me, it seems like our friendship is awkward at time, there’s long silences in between, don’t really have much to say. I mean for me it’s hard already hard enough for me to engage in a long convo, I’m sort of shy but I’m trying to break out of it, and don’t really have much to say, it sucks because I feel like I’m ruining a friendship that could be great. He kind of has the same personality when I’m with him. I don’t really have many friends well because they’ve all have been assholes to me, so I really don’t have many people to talk to when I want to. So what do u guys of my friendship with this guy? Is it me or do u think it’s complicacted? Just another one I don’t I ever receive text messages from him saying what’s up or checking up on me. Now take for granted he might have a lot of friends so idk. I’m usually the one who texts first"

I’d like to think that I did not change a whole lot (probably true :’) ) but my best friend has been hanging out with some of our friends and they’ve been affecting her attitude in a way, and she’s starting to become the same people we would always laugh at for being stupid and ignorant and petty.

ff,"How should I deal with this flaky friend?
I have a friend who I totally love who ALWAYS flakes. whether the plans are big or small 95% of the plans we make (initiated by her often) end up with ""I don't feel like going out"" or ""i made other plans"" or ""i don't remember making these plans"" etc. This is super annoying and all but it's not the whole problem.

Since she's super flaky I always call her out on it or joke about it. for example: In our group chat another friend will make plans and she'll be like ""ok its set"" and then i'll reply like ""that only means it's half set"" and I know I'm being snarky and all but she deserves it for being such a flake! right? Anyway I guess it really annoys her when i do this so she confronted me about it calling me a bitch for always making jokes about her being flaky and asked me not to do it anymore. I agreed but I kind of wish I didn't and now i feel like not even replying when we talk in our group chat. Im sure making snarky comments about someone being a flake can't be anywhere near as annoying as constantly being flaked on, Right? There's been some huge plans that she flaked on including travel and birthday plans that really upset me especially since she's such a good friend and it means a lot to me for her to make it to those special occasions.

Shouldn't we be angry at our parents for only being concerned with their own suffering?"
ff,"Should family be more than this?
I’m 24 and no kids and my family is just like everyone else’s around me; broken.

My dad is sometimey and has kept few promises he has made to me. In the end it’s not him being bad that’s the problem, it’s that he says the problem is ME. Like with men I have talked to in the past, they can only say what I’M doing wrong not listening to me and claiming I am crazy.

This behavior with my father led me to cutting off all contact late last year. My family, his side, otherwise see nothing wrong with his behavior. The issue is ME. I’m expecting too much from him.....like if he says he’s coming to our city (he lives 30 mins away) and I get upset when he doesn’t show and he’s done it just about every time. Or even when he claims he’s coming to get the dog he left with my uncle (left him there a year ago claiming it would only be for two weeks) he just lies constantly.

I was raised around my family growing up. I didn’t see my father but I saw his side of the family, cousins, aunts and uncles. They may have lived states away but we always spent summers and holidays together.

At this point my family on either side rarely see each other. We have family reunions that none of my cousins attend, all too busy now that their grown.

At the end of the day I was told this;

I’m an adult and my father has nothing to do with the things I’ve done in life, or nothing to do with the guys I used to talk to that led to constant rejection and overall cynical view on love (getting sperm donor at 28.)

I should be grateful for times spent with him, five minutes should be the best in the world (he’s so self absorbed I’m only worth five minutes every few months)

I have no right as a child to threaten him if he wont leave me alone for good.

I don’t see why I have to live like this, I suffer from depression and constantly beatbox myself up over every mistake I make. I’m unhappy, I’ve been getting better since getting rid od him and focusing on the family that actually has time time for me. 

A family shouldn’t just be there for emergency. A family is thinking of others before themselves, loving one another enough to know them. Am I really expecting or demanding too much?

Am I just mad because yet another man won’t do what I want?"
ff,"My family is a disaster
Hello, I'm a 17 year old girl, and I'm tired of living.

My father and my mother hate each other deeply, my father works and my mother is a housewife, recently they divorced, and both want custody of me and my siblings.

My father constantly says that my mom steals money from him (he stills has to mantain us and her), and that she is a bad person that the only thing that wants is the house where we live in. My mother says that he never gives her anything (yet we live very well because he takes care of us all the time) and that when she doesn't have money for making lunch is because he didn't gave her the money and that he is making us believe that she is bad just so we go with him. I don't know who to believe I love them both.

On the other hand, my father is always scolding us because of my little sister, who is always treating us badly, but when we deffend from her she is the victim. Today she told my father everything about the secrets I told her, about how sometimes I want to die, and all the thoughts I trust her, she just told them because we were having a little fight, I couldn't even tell hers because I didn't dare to. My father ended up scolding me and saying I don't value anything, and that I should stop being such an awful person, that I was one of those woman who everyone hates, just because I decided to deffend myself from her, and that SHE was the one being treated badly. My dad says always such hurtful things to me, he says that a career in music is useless and he isn't going to cost it, but when I told him I wanted to work to have my own money he just didn't let me... I want to be independent so I don't have to respect him all the time, I want to have my life, I want to be happy away from here, even if it mean not having much money, as long as I have music everything will be okay, is the only thing that calms me.

I love my mother, even though too religious and hates my music, she is loving and she always says that if she had money she would pay any career I wanted, and even though my father is very cruel sometimes and wants me to study law, I love him too, I don't know how to get away from here, if I can't I don't know what should I do, who should I choose.

I want to work and stop being obedient and afraid of my dad, everytime I think about how can I tell him that I don't agree with what he's doing I'm afraid, because he is the one giving me everything I have. He yells at me when I deffend myself from my sister, when I told him I wasn't going to stop listening to metal he yelled at me, also when I tell him that I won't stop loving music. He thinks he is untouchable, that everything he says is the right way, and that if I don't calm down then he will treat me even worst. HELP ME PLEASE."

However before i knew that there was a tjme where i messaged her and she hadn't responded and a couple of weeks had gone by. I was thinking that I was annoying her. So i told her we shouldn't bftiends anymore. Later finding out that she had communication issues. She literally has like no friends at all which i genuinely believe.
       Eventually we see each other in public, afterwards i message her and apologize, and wanting to befriends again. She eventually accepts my apology and we're somewhat on good terms.  We eventaully hang out in person again and she is talking to me about how her boyfriend never talks to her and that her dad is being mean to her. So i give her the advice that idk her boyfriend but he could possibly be cheating on you if stops communicating as much woth you. But, again stressing idk know him so take what i said with a grain of salt.
        Weeks go by and she evetnually tells me that our friendshup isn't going to work out, and that nothing good has really came of it. And i should just stkp trying to be friends. This really hurt me i care about her a great deal. She then proceeds to unfriend me on facebook, and snapchat, and tells me to not contact her anymore. I need some helps guys, i feel like i should give het somr space and time to cool down and then i should message her apologizing for everything and that i want to be friends again.

We've been friends since 8th grade, and she's a great friend, outgoing, funny, smart, the usual. We're pretty close, not absolute besties, but at the level where we can share memes with each other at 3am and not think it weird. But this year she's the only one of my friends from last year that has the same lunch as me, so I sit with her everyday. The problem is her bestest friend in the whole world also has the same lunch, so I'm always the awkward third wheel. I always try to help her when she needs it because a, she's my friend, and b, she doesn't have an easy home life. She never has enough to eat at lunch so I always bring something extra, and she also always needs rides everywhere. She says it's because her guardian is at work, or is visiting other family, is babysitting, but I think her family just doesn't want to give her rides places. I don't mind most of the time, but it's gotten to the point where she almost assumes we'll give her a ride when she needs it, and we can't always do that. She also stopped coming to lunch last week to go practice in the orchestra room, and I never even see her until orchestra class. I know something's not right, but every attempt to figure it out has gone unrewarded. I've made new friends this year through cross country and orchestra, and they have the same lunch I do. I went and sat with them one day, but my other friend looked almost mad when I told her I was sitting with them just for that day. It's okay for you to ignore me most of lunch and then not even show up and not answering me when I ask where you've been, but I can't make new friends and sit with them every now and then? I'm just not sure where to go from here, because I don't want to stop being friends, I really don't, but I just feel like my new friends can be better friends, and friends I can relate to better. I just don't want to do or say something I'll regret, especially because I know her life at home isn't great and she needs friends, but she shouldn't be pushing her problems onto me either"

It was more like she did something I was not okay with and she never really reached out to me ( months). She was my best friend and someone I love and care about. I know I made my mistakes as well. She texted me to reach out and I talked to normally to her didn't get angry/say anything angry... just small talk...

ff,"Not invited to my friend's wedding. Is it time to abandon ship?
A guy I have been close friends with for the last 13 years is getting married this year and I've come to the realisation that I'm not invited to the wedding. To be honest, we are not as close as we used to be. We used to hang out all time, but as lives became busy, we spent less time together. I still attend almost all of his social gatherings, though that is probably only 3 to 4 times a year.
The weird thing is, I was invited to his engagement party. I got him and his partner a really meaningful gift that they still comment on whenever they see me, yet they didn't invite me the wedding.
When I was slightly intoxicated at another friend's girls night some time ago, I asked the bride if invites had been sent out yet because I couldn't remember receiving mine. We then began the awkward exchange in which she told me it was really hard to narrow down the guest list and I realised I was never getting my invite. I tried to act as if I wasn't offended and that I understood, but honestly, I'm really hurt.
I've been invited to the hen's night which is in a month. It is not a cheap night. Upwards of $200 for accommodation, games etc.
It feels rude to expect me to pay so much to attend a hen's night when they wouldn't even pay for me to be a guest at their wedding. But I also realise that if I don't go to the hen's, it could come across that I don't value the friendship enough to go.

ff,"My mother and her tragically unlucky family
Hey, guys, I thought this was worth posting because I'm still totally gobsmacked at how unlucky and dysfunctional my mother's side of the family was, and it interests me because it sounds like a curse, when it was likely all just chance.

My mother was born in the late 50's, and it was my grandparents' third child, although she eventually had six siblings in the end (only two brothers are still alive). The way my auntie and uncles died, and how one turned out, creeps me out. So here we go;

So my mother used to have younger twin siblings - one boy and one girl - and my mother when she was four got into a serious car accident (grandfather was driving) so this would be 1962. She and my grandfather survived but her twin siblings didn't survive and both were tragically killed at the age of two.

But it gets unluckier.

So, a few years go by, my mother has two new little brothers at the time (let's call them George, born in 1963, and Alan, born a couple of years later)

1975, and again a tragic loss. My grandparents and family go through the loss of George, who, if you do the simple math, was only twelve when he died in a boat accident during a school trip. Apparently he jumped in the water to impress his friends while kayaking, and a boat later came speeding, didn't see him, and the front of it struck George's head. He drowned while unconscious because the teacher wasn't present (and apparently, he got in alot of shit for that).

But again, it gets unluckier.

Four years later, 1979, my grandfather, who was one of the bosses of a distribution warehouse, got into an accident during work. Wasn't told how, but it was fatal.

So during the late 70's leading up to my grandfather's death, my mother's two older brothers (let's name them Johnny and Frank, both in their twenties) end up doing drugs, although my uncle Frank apparently handled his habit better than Johnny. Uncle Johnny eventually moved onto injecting heroin, was stealing off family and friends until he got kicked out of my grandma's. He eventually disappeared from the family.

So 1983, after a couple years from last hearing of Johnny, my mother and her family receive news that a body found overdosed in a park four months prior, belonged to Johnny. Died at twenty-seven and wasn't identified for months by forensics. He was homeless and had nothing in possession to identify who he was.

So my grandma, who is now nearing ninety, is still going strong. Mentally and physically great besides just a walking stick. She lost four children at the ages of two, twelve, and twenty-seven. And a husband.

I never met any of them because this, of course, all happened before I was born.

The ones who are still here is Alan, Frank, and my mother. My uncle Alan turned out to be okay. Frank, on the other hand, now in his sixties, is an abusive alcoholic who lives in a crummy apartment with whoknows and has two kids he never sees. He turned down rehab many times but my grandma once told me that he drinks because he blames himself for what happened to Johnny, since he was the one who introduced him to drugs. But he hates us and wants nothing to do with the rest of his family anymore. I've only seen him four times in my life, and he was abusive on two occasions. One time when we went for a family meal when I was six, he ruined the night by abusing the resterant staff.

So my mother and uncle Alan are the only people out of seven kids who turned out to have positive lives. Depressing as fuck, isn't it?"

So, for most of my life, I've gotten into private arguments with my dad that range from little spats to shouting matches (ranging from things like 'I'm not changing into something else' to 'You're wasting your potential').

Hello
I have two good friends male (27) and female (27) who are in a relationship with each other. We have been friends for almost 7 years now. 2 years ago, I (26) started dating my current bf (35). During that time, I was playing hard to get, and I was not really interested in my bf at the time so I would talk about him to my male friend who is in the relationship with my other friend. At one point, my friend told me that my bf is a sucker for love because he was chasing a girl that didn't want him...fastfoward...I accidentally told my bf that my friend called him a sucker and my bf said he doesn't want me being friends with him anymore. When my friend and I spoke about my bf, my bf and I were just dating, we were not bf and gf so I don't think my bf should taken it to the extent that I shouldnt be friends with him. Regardless....the point is that idk how to tell my friend that I can't be friends with him anymore...and if I'm not friends with him than his gf, which is my friend too, is not going to be my friends anymore...I feel bad because they are always asking to go out with us but they don't know the arguments I had with my bf regarding this matter. I feel stuck in this situation and I need your assistance. Thanks"

ff,"How to cope with disrespectful and lying friend?
HI I'm new to reddit so please bear with me

So this is the situation: 
My friend and I often interact while playing online games as we're both huge nerds and gamers. I really enjoy spending time with her. However she has this other friend that I really dislike and I would rather play alone than put up with interacting with her friend. I have on multiple occasions expressed my discomfort with her friend and she has acknowledged it but would still invite him anyways without asking me. When that happens I usually just say sorry I don't feel like playing. Sorry for being difficult. She knows her friend will repel me. So anyways after sometime I asked if I can request not to invite him when I'm playing with her and would understand if she said no cause I realize it's a selfish request. She said it's ok no problem. So then we proceed to our routine and there's no issue whatsoever. I told her if it's too difficult to say no or your friend keeps bugging you about it I can go as I didn't want to make it difficult with my own selfishness. 

The problem a rise when she invited a mystery friend with different name. I suspected and knew that it was her friend that I disliked so immediately asked who that was and she said it's just a random. Not happy with her lying I went off to calm down and confronted her about it, trying to be as clear and straight to the point as I can. I expressed that what she did was hurtful and disrespectful in my point of view. I told her I'm not pleased at the fact she lied even when I called her out. So I said it's on her to resolve this issue. She replied saying there is no issue and what she did was fine. Saying it wasn't disrespectful and its not a big lie plus it was to see if I would even notice its her friend. Long story short she said if it was her she wouldn't be angry cause she's a grown up and that I'm being immature and childish by blowing things out of proportion over such joke-trivial matter. 

So this is more or less the situation and at the moment it's not good. As she thinks I'm in the wrong and she's right. I have considered the fact that I am wrong and have asked for an outside opinion but all my friends are just angry at how she's treating me. 

I understand that she can be friends with and spend time with whoever she wants. It's her life afterall. I'm not making her choose cause I know it's selfish and wrong so I'm choosing to remove myself in that situation as it's the only thing to do besides putting up with her friend. My problem is the fact that she attempted to trick me to play together with her friend and continue lying about it upon confrontation. Also by doing so I feel disrespected as she completely disregarded my feelings and opinion in the matter. I would have been perfectly fine if she told me at the start her friend wants to play and she can't really say no or she wants to play with him etc etc. In that case I'll just make myself scarce which I have no issue on doing. Instead she resorted to being deceitful with something so simple and dumb. There's quite a lot more so I'll probably update this but this is in essence more of less the situation."
ff,"My best friend has completely cut me out of his life for a girl and i am feeling depressed
Hey guys, ive known my best mate for 7 years and we finished high school and now both go to the same uni, we were so tight, like brothers. We were gym partners, helped other out with assignments, and hanged out so frequently. That was all until he got a girlfriend.

He met with this chick like 5 months ago and i was pleased for the dude, he seemed happy. 5 months on he still seems so attached to his girl, he rarey texts me and we used to play xbox together but none of those happen anymore. On the rare occasion when we do go to hang out he is always on his phone texting his girl, infact even in the cinema we watched a movie he was literally texting her during the film... even on xbox i hear the phone go off every minute or so

We done so much shit together.... i gave him a driving instructor with a family discount cos i knew the guy and he got his license now, i helped him raise $600 for a new pc, and even went into a lil business together where i invested and he knew the contacts.

This dude was my brother basiclly and now he never has time for me, we were so damn close and i wish things could go back to how they were without this girl because she is so paranoid of him talking to another girl

I dont get why he has done this to me, ive always been there for him and now he doesnt even respond to my messages, i see him active on facebook but doesnt even read messages... i helped this dude out so much in high school he was going to fail, i taught him some shit and thats how we got close and he passed literally because of me.

I dont know what to do... i feel like we are becoming so dinstant and only communicate once a week or so, im feeling so depressed and mentally hurt....

TL;DR; : What shall i do? Shall i talk to him or just wait it out"
ff,"Lifelong friend keeps lashing out
So I have this friend, she's my best friend and have been forever. ?We've been friends since we were 2, we traveled the world together. We're now 25.
She's been through a lot, difficult family stuff, life isn't easy on her at all and her entire life is struggling. Honestly, she needs me. Without me she'd be pretty lost and she knows it. I pretty much take the mothers role. Her mother isn't there (and usually she's more destructive than anything) and I do a lot of the stuff mothers do, including being her punching bag.
Because of all of this, she tends to be very impulsive and when she's upset she can say stuff that are very hard for me, like she can get upset with me and then say mean stuff, and that she wants me and everyone else to f-ck of and leave her alone, sometimes worse. It doesn't sound too bad but when it happens repeatedly from a good friend when you try to help her it's really really hard.
Every time I have to tell her that it hurts me, I have to practically beg her to say sorry. Eventually she breaks down and says she's so sorry and that she can't control herself. I always forgive.
The thing is I know she doesn't mean it. And also I know she's naturally impulsive. But also I don't think she's really trying to control it. I know she's got so much on her plate that it's natural to lose control and not be able to always control everything, but it's really hard for me even though I know she doesn't mean it. 
Right now I honestly don't feel like I want to talk to her. I think the fact I ALWAYS forgive makes her not really try to control it. She lost dozens of friends because of it but she know I will always stay.
Right now I just feel like telling her that it's been one time too much (I've warned her before that eventually I might just unwillingly break), and that I can't take it. I forgave her probably over a hundred times, seriously. And I honestly care about her, and I honestly know she doesn't mean it, and I honestly worry that without me she won't be able to survive. But also I just can't stand being a punching bag anymore, it's emotionally exhausting and I feel drained. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't live my life like this but I can't live my life knowing that my leaving ruined her, which really might happen."
ff,"I am scared
Hey guys, posting this on a throw away just incase.

Anyway, a bit of back story:
Me and this guy at work met because of our smoking habits. We both happen to smoke weed, so naturally we started hanging out together. It was all cool for a while, and then he started getting needy, trying to get whatever he could from me. He would ask for cash, ask me to buy him food, ask me for bud etc.

Then I found out by mistake that he is a meth smoker, which is something I do not agree with at all. He just became more hostile around me after this point (not physically, only slightly verbally/emotionally), so I decided to slowly break the tie.

So I started to ignore his messages and Facebook texts. I quit work btw (its been 6 months). He doesn't know where I live, but we both know that our town is very small. Basically everyone knows everyone here. So the chance of me meeting up with him in the future is very possible.

Anyway, as bad as all that sounds, I want to try and mend the relationship. What should I do?

ff,"relationship with sister falling apart, different memories, need advice
Hi,

In a nutshell - my sister (both about 30years old) has been accusing me of saying various horrible/bad things, often saying I said it seconds ago, sometimes hours ago and getting angry with me.

I don't think I've been saying these things.

It's really wearing me down, either I am being horrible and forgetting, or she is (perhaps unknowingly) making it up.

I've recently said I'm going to record some of our conversations to see if I can prove my innocence, or find out I have an issue with my memory/attitude and get help.

This has gone down very badly, she now insists I don't speak to her for at least as long as I may record her.

What do I do? My goal is for my family to get along well, or at least OK - but I have no idea what I can do to fix things or make them better.

Any thoughts or advice is more than welcome

Fully aware this is my perspective, and I may have subjectivly squewed it - will try and answer any questions if asked"

ff,"Longtime close friend, brand-new bewilderment
My friend is distractable. He thinks irrationally. And he barely listens anymore.

I feel as though I've become a pane of glass or a mirror to him. When we're in a car together, he drones on about things (tell me if this has happened to you) he's told me many times before. Occasionally, in the middle, there's an admission: ""I probly told you this before, but.."". However, the story always continues, even if I briefly recap the story for him. When it's obvious the information has been shared, the most pressing imperative seems to be on reiterating it. Perhaps I didn't give the desired response the first time. I get the feeling he just doesn't care whether I'd like to hear it. I also possess conversational preferences, and they never include hearing the same story twice. After countless reccurences of this scenario, it seems that my considerations aren't really valued or remembered. Mentally, he seems to be on a train and passengers (myself included) are always bustling through and, as such, might just seem replaceable.

There doesn't seem anymore to be a genuine interest in my take on things. Questions are rarely asked, and if they are, they're poised in such a way as to elicit some agreeable response. We've never had a problem with differing opinions, but lately there is a marked disinterest in mine. If I express perhaps a different perspective I might share on something, he's typically halfway through deconstructing it and preparing a rebuttal by the time I've reached the bulk of my first sentence. Lately, I make sure to be concise. 10-word sentences. Brief, clear declarations with stipulations kept to a minimum. I do this in a sincere effort to make sure at least some of my thoughts reach him via this channel called speech. I feel a little like a sidekick, implicitly expected to go along with whatever is said or suggested and quietly supporting. I have needs and I make sure they're met. I just make sure, now, that they're met completely before I go into a conversation or endeavor with him.

The attention span has completely plummeted. He and his phone might as well have fused into one entity. Often times, when we're driving somewhere, or at our shared place of work, he will open a conversation. What he desires to be communicated is seemingly achieved. I give plenty of time, listening quietly and waiting a few seconds before responding. When I respond, sometimes I'll be surprised that I've been able to speak for a couple of sentences without being interrupted. Then, I'll look up and almost invariably, he's on his phone texting, on social media, or looking at boobs. I fall silent and look at him, stopping my speech, and sometimes there's a feigned response that hazily resembles some degree of mental assimilation. Other times, my input is simply ignored. I feel often that I am relegated to silence by virtue of necessity. What is the point of talking or even attempting to share with someone if they feel their device is more important than you? When there is no device involved, the listening is of such low quality that I feel as though I'm viewed as a shadow, or some reflective panel that occasionally flashes some piece of light which sparks a brief reaction.

I use the word reaction explicitly to differentiate from response. Responding, to me, would be careful consideration of the texture of the exchange. What I see falls on a spectrum between bristling and hyperenthusiastic. Everything in the observable behavior appears to come from an emotionally fueled place. I long ago ceased trying to appeal to logic and reason, because there seems to be a fantasy aspect to his formulations about reality, business, and essentially learning in general. An obstinate and vigorous type of chauvinism appears when the discussion involves logically based and scientifically supported criterion as pillars of discussion. ""Have you ever thought that maybe our ideas about science are just implanted by society, and another race has fully influenced our evolution as human beings?"" (to imply that the scrutiny intrinsic to the scientific community's assimilation of data is too dismissive toward fringe and pseudoscientific contributions). ""Physics is just one way to understand reality; there are physics we aren't even aware of that we won't know about for hundreds of years"" (as a soft excuse or rationale to discredit or invalidate the advances in modern physics and thus not include them in discussion). ""Can you prove to me that 1 + 1 = 2?"" (in a maddening conversation I had with him whereupon he elected to discredit all mathematics by attempting to upend the premise that numbers can accurately represent ideas).

I love math and physics because it helps accurately explain the world I live in. I can't share any of that enthusiasm with him, though, because his defenses rise as he falls lure to the siren of unreasonably ambiguous premises of belief. I get it; it represents flexibility and fluidity. There's no pinning someone 
down for their rationales or justifications if they honestly feel their ideas reside above the established and fair principles of unbiased scientific criticism. The implication seems to be that it's a lot more fun and even more reasonable to live in the dark, because anything a person makes up could be true, and the absence of scrutiny works synergistically to provide disincentives for the need for proof.

We have been friends since third grade. We're both in our thirties now. We've remained close and shared lots of valuable experiences. Emotionally, we're there for each other and that's always what we've been best at. But I feel this insistence on the employment of a deductive philosophy of thinking which ignores outside criteria in favor of ""empathetic"" consult has wedged a chasm between us. I can't really tell if it's me or him whom has done the most changing in the last few years, but rest assured, I am working at a 100% level of effort to rectify what issues there are and reforge our understandings.

A personal aside:  Three years ago, I experienced a rather significant mental shift. I began to make efforts to look at the world more objectively, understanding better how I was not the focal point of existence. I took myself down a few notches, and in doing so, became irrevocably drawn to learning about the finer workings of the world in which I lived.  During this time, I had the pleasure of working with a young man seven years my junior with whom I could seemingly achieve no middle ground. Even just a casual extended conversation seemed unbearable. We came from different places and really just resigned ourselves to tolerating one another. For a long while, I just couldn't put my finger on what bugged me about the guy. Then, about six months in, it hit me: I was unable to reasonably share anything I had learned, without it being scrutinized needlessly by way of the contrast of his own biased interpretations. The scrutiny itself didn't bother me; it was the nature of the uncredentialed and entitled rebuttals. They had little basis in scientific sourcing and did not stand stand up well to criticism. The young man's ideas about the world were essentially all based on his own experience, and there appeared to be no real desire in him to contrast those findings with a collective reality outside of his own.  I eventually came to realize I didn't like the kid because he reminded me of me.

From that point on, I vowed to observe my thought processes more closely. The last thing I wanted was to waste someone's time unwittingly by spewing nonsensical garbage of which I had no demonstrable proof or understanding. I read about using proper reasoning and recognizing logical fallacies. I worked to become more mindful toward my own irrational inclinations. It became tantamount to recognize the ignorances and defenses to which I'd become accustomed to clinging, and replace them with the collective wisdom provided by my new best friends: logical and rational thought. As I was doing my best to employ these utilities, I figured I could scarce be assumed a fool and reasonably sort out those ideas which did not hold up to proper scrutiny.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, this new method of articulating reality didn't win me many friends. The good ones I've retained, and those who didn't share this unearthed enthusiasm for inductive reasoning were left behind. This friendship I share with this person seems like a relic of the past me. I don't believe he's shared the same monumental changes in mental processing. He's always had a certain flair for exaggeration and fantasy, and until recently, I just accepted it as face value and dealt with the occasional misunderstandings as I'm sure he had with me. Now, however, the implications seem more pronounced. He's running a business and is constantly distracted. The time we share is often saturated by ramblings of fanatical pseudoscience or mysticism which are 
impossibly asserted and employ mind-numbingly irrational justifications. The only discipline seems to be that of a zealous allegiance to the fortification of the shared psychological concoctions of the hopefully ignorant. There is little point in rebuttal anymore because, deductively, the answer has already been solved for. And rest assured, 1 + 1 = 2 was not used in this equation.

If indeed there is a future for this friendship, at least on my half, it involves intensely disciplined patience. I feel sometimes like a social worker, intently listening and softly steering the delinquent in a healthier direction. I meditate and identify as Buddhist. I consider myself to be a spiritual person, and I understand that my interpretation of reality is uniquely pixelated in ways that differ from those of others. I work to cultivate higher compassion and practice patience and kindness when I feel a bristling within myself or witness a bristling in others. As such, I feel that just living my values and being a good listener might be the way through this. I can't help but feeling, though, that this is the beginning of a fork in the road which leads to an increasingly fainter sense of collective recognition."
ff,"Is this my distorted reality?
Okay, I almost always run into this problem with friends, and I'm not sure how to get out of the situation without feeling guilty or ashamed of losing yet another friend.

Situation One
There's this friend whom I helped many times and every single time other people bashed me, she would either laughed with other people or further ridicule me.  Things like asking me to fix her phone, helping her find a place to rent, providing her with advice on many issues...

I have since asked her not to further ridicule me, and her response was, ""oh this is not what I do, but I would like to remain friends with you because you are a resourceful person and you see things differently."" I kind of ghosted her after I graduated from university, but I always wondered whether I handled the situation appropriately.  She always tries to avoid me in public space, but when she gets into a car accident, she would call me and ask for help.  I am neither interested nor in love with her.  I actually felt she might be in a hopeless state, that's why she wanted my help.  

SCENARIO TWO
I have this friend who always makes weird implication towards how stingy I am.  They made assumptions about my contributions to me and my SO and said things like, ""Oh, if given the opportunity, would you kill [so's name] and claim his insurance policy"", ""You know greedy people normally turn out to be the poorest bunch in the population right?"".  The fact is, I have been contributing to the relationship between my SO, my SO is older than me, so in a way, my SO is more financially independent.  At times when SO is helping me out, I always mark the number down so I know how much I owe SO [actually he calculated the amount and sends me invoices].  But I won't disclose such details to my friends.  I am just disappointed as to how people assume things and the last thing I want is to be the victim in every f*ing relationship.

Is there something I am not seeing here, is there a problem with how I am handling the situation well?"

ff,"A friend of mine is being mean, or am I sensitive?
A long time friend of mine (let’s call her Abby) has recently been a little cruel imo, but I’m not sure if it’s me. These three things happen in less than 2 days and now we’re not speaking. Also, we’re 14 and just started high school.

1: She laughed at my new haircut. I know that sounds frivolous, but Abby and this other girl were literally outright laughing. She claims she was just ‘being honest’.

2: She left me wandering. We had agreed to walk to an after school event together. She started walking without me and didn’t tell me, so I was walking around the high school, sending her a million messages trying to find her. I guessed she had left, but I didn’t want to ditch her if she hadn’t. I eventually just walked by myself. When I got there (late) it turned out she walked with two other girls (including the hair-laughing girl). When I called her out she said I was overreacting and that walking alone shouldn’t bother me (it didn’t, I was upset because she didn’t care about me) and that she wouldn’t care if the shoe was on the other foot. All I asked was that she apologize and next time *let me know* if she changed plans, which earned a sarcastic/sassy ‘we’ll sor-ry’.

3: Another friend of mine and Abby’s (it’s a trio friendship) asked to hang out (her name will be Robin). Abby didn’t come which I was kind of glad about, so it was just me and Robin. We walked around town and all. It wasn’t even very late (6:00) when this one group of guys (4 of them, 18ish) hollered at us from their car. At first we thought it was a prank, but it kept going. They did this multiple times, following us or looping back around to greet us. We were getting freaked out. So, when they loop back around again I’ve had enough. I yelled at them to F*** off.

I thought this was smart. I figured they’d either realize we weren’t having fun or something. Surprise, surprise, it made things worse. A lot worse.

Eventually, they got stuck at a light and we sprinted to a family members house nearby (who turned out had recently been hospitalized) and hid there until my Mom came.

Now, I know the F off move was incredibly dumb. I made it worse not only for myself but for my friend. Either way, the next day I was feeling guilty as hell and worried about Robin and what she thought of me and was just stressed in general. Not in a good mood.

I don’t even tell my friend what happened, she greets me with weird hints about last night. So I simply ask her to stop with these weird hints and actually talk to me. Basically, Robin told her about last night. So Abby being super nice says, to the best of my memory, “You realize your mistake, right? You understand that it was your fault. So just so you know, I have no sympathy at all.”

I know I was dumb, but hearing this after everything and what I already blamed myself for being told so bluntly and harshly at me by my friend set me off. I left and actually went and cried in the girls washroom that I know no one ever uses. I’m not sure what I expected, it was my fault, but she *greeted* me like this. No, “Hey, I heard you were followed...” or ANYTHING. Just straight up “it’s your fault I have no sympathy.” Like, Hey, nice to see you too.

Either way, we’re not talking anymore. I’ve tried to bring it up but it’s always, “I was just being honest... what did you expect? So you want me to lie? You’re being silly...” No acknowledgement. Also, this fight between me and Abby is affecting my friendship with Robin because it was a trio friendship. Also, Abby is my only friend at my school, I’m scared to be alone.

Sorry for how long this is, I think it’s sort of a rant too. What should I do? Am I completely out of line? How should I go about fixing this?

At the very least, how can I prevent this from affecting me and Robin?"
ff,"Having to share a small living space with Grandpa
My grandpa and I are having trouble adjusting to our new living situation, and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas to help us in this predicament.

Backstory:

I never really saw eye to eye with him while growing up. He was quite the wild prankster, and his antics often left me humiliated and embarrassed. Back in my boyhood of 1991, he pantsed me while I performed at the school talent show. He routinely mentions this while at family gatherings, and it has subsequently caused me extreme grief. This trend of surprise humiliation lasted for two decades. Just when I thought me and gramps were cool again, I'd feel my pants hit the ground. He's  deprived me of my sanity, as well as given me an extreme fear of public speaking scenarios. I ended up forcing him to go to family counseling with me, and he denied the whole thing. After turning in historical footage (my mom always cam-corded my recitals or graduation ceremonies), he finally gave in and admitted to his rude behavior. It took a couple dozen sessions, ending with a mock-talent-show, where I played my trumpet for the therapist. Gramps just sat there, cool as ice. With arms folded, he nodded to me - and that's where things changed.

Anyhow, I had an extra ticket to go see Teagan and Sara - so I got ol' gramps on the phone. He kinda razzed me for listening to such feminine sounding music, but eventually accepted my invitation. I picked him up and brought him to the venue. The ticket office said there was a mixup, and that we'd get front-row seats. This was my lucky day, as well as a great way to finally bond with the old codger. 

It took a couple of songs, but he really got into it. He was so exuberant, jumping up and down on his seat. He pulled me up, and I did the same. After the first half of the set wrapped up, the sisters on stage looked down at gramps and I. They asked us if we were having a good time, and also the nature of our relation. A stage hand passed down a microphone to gramps. 

""I'm here with my grandson!""

There was this big 'awwww' that came from the crowd. They asked us how long he'd been a fan, and he mentioned the fact that I would sometimes play their songs on my trumpet. To my amazement, they pulled me and gramps on stage for the next song. They got me a trumpet and instructed me to play a solo to ""I was a fool"" - It was literally one of the best moments of my life. I was on stage with my favorite sister duet band.

Right as I put the brass mouthpiece to my lips, I felt those wrinkly little fingers jutting into my belt loops. I tried to stop him, but my pants hit the ground before I could react. I wanted to die in that moment. Security ended up escorting us out of the venue, where a police officer was waiting for us.

Now we're both cell mates for the next year. We got caught in some type of legal double-whammy. He, being the pantser, was ruled guilty for sexual assault. Me, the pants-ee, was convicted of exposure and indecency. Both of us will have to register as sex offenders once we're out of the clink. 

Anyhow - I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how we could pass the time together? Any board games or things like that? We have a whole year of time to kill, and it really took being cellmates for me to understand exactly how generation gapped we are. Anyhow, your advice is greatly appreciated. I gotta hide this phone, but I'll check for your replies later tonight. 

Thanks!"
ff,"Why is it so difficult to preserve wealth within a family for longer than one hundred years?
Some family members can make fortune during their lifetime. Because they were lucky, or because they worked hard, or smart. It doesn’t matter. It is almost inevitable that after two generations passing the lucky one the third generation returns to the poverty with very poor financial background.
There are always and always will be more failures than successful stories.

Why is it happening?

Because of mismanagement.
There are no other reasons!
Not because they are too old, too young, too tall, or too stupid…
But, because they failed to create a system which can monitor, rule, manage, predict future successes and failures.
Most families have no idea that such systems have been existing and successfully helping some families to do this job efficiently.

Do those families share this knowledge with humanity?
No way. Why would they do that? They literally rule the world, they have all the power and all the money.
I’m fortunate to collaborate with some of those families.
What if I ask you:
Would it be interesting for you to uncover their secrets and to know how they do it?
Would it be interesting for you to see a blueprint of their success?

Many families are struggling in our society.

They have no idea where they are going to and what goals they have. 
It leads to frustration, procrastination, apathy and depression. 
Because they have been caught in a daily routine. Day after day, month after month…
No time to think, no time to plan, no time to review or set goals.
In my opinion, this is the reality for 99,99% of the human population of the Earth.
Is there a solution?

Yes!

But, you have to implement some strategies.
It includes not only intellectual, emotional and spiritual development, but financial evolution also.
Without a strong financial fundament, it is almost impossible to cultivate wealth in your family in a long-term run.

To be continued.

ff,"I've been sleeping with my best friends girlfriend for 3 years??
I'd be lying if I said I don't feel guilty. But on the other hand I still do it. We have been seeing each other behind his back for about 3 or more years every other day. She tells me everything about them. How sex with him is awful. Which I knew already because he asked me what he should do about it. I gave him good advice. I guess it didn't change anything. The sex with her is amazing. I think it's how taboo it is. We're all over each other. She lets me do things to her that She won't let my friend do on her , like anal I was the first one to ever do anal and throat fuck her and STILL do it. She wants a relationship with me and there's no way in hell that's going to happen. She thinks that I'm in love with her and that we will be together. She talks about us running far away together. All I have to do is say the word. I'm a big believer in ""once a cheater, always a cheater"". But she seems to be in love with me. My gut is telling me shes in love with me. My gut is never wrong. I guess I'm doing both of them wrong. I know he uses reddit so I'm not going to give all the details. I also want to add that I still respect the guy a whole lot. I would hate to lose his friendship. I know I should stop but the sex is just so addicting. She had sex with my brother too."

ff,"Questioning the legitimacy of a friendship (very long post)
Alrighty. Buckle up, because this post is going to be long. There's gonna be a lot of information tossed at you, so if you're feeling like demolishing a massive wall of text, read on.

A couple years back, I got my first real job. It was great. The people, the work, everything. I become friends with a waitress, which is kind of usual seeing as I've never been able to make friends with a woman before and she's a bit older than me, but that's beside the point. We hit it off as soon as we start working shifts together and talked constantly. She'd occasionally ask me to come out to eat with her, and on a couple occasions we did and both had a great time (as far as I could tell anyway). She'd also suggest that her and I should get together sometime and hang out with another waitress that's she's friends with.

A few months in, my parents discover my friendship with the waitress and immediately assume the worst, e.g. I'm only friends with her for sex/drugs/alcohol, all of which aren't true. They couldn't seem to grasp that we could be just friends despite the age gap. They eventually believe that I'm telling them the truth, but not before one of them calls my boss and tells him that the waitress and I are ""dating"" but I'm too stupid to know it. This puts her in some hot water and she tells me about it the next day. My parents continue bothering me about the friendship with my coworker. 

In spite of this, nothing changes between the waitress and I. We still have a great time talking to each other, and I even stay at work for hours after my shift ends to talk with her. Two weeks after my parents find out about my workplace friendship, I turn 18. Suddenly my parents don't care about who I'm friends with anymore, saying that I can make my own choices now. I tell my friend that she doesn't have to worry about my parents being involved anymore, and life is good. She also tells me that she's looking for a roommate, and asks me if I'm interested. Over the course of the next six months, she makes several more offers to hang out with me and her waitress friend, only it never happens. The dates never get nailed down, or I just never hear back from her after I express interest. I chalk it up to forgetfulness or a busy schedule and leave it alone. 

Thanksgiving rolls around. I tell my friend that due to pressure from my parents, I'm going to have to quit working and find a full time job. She's sad at first but is still determined to spend time with me despite the fact that I'm quitting. I start my new job and hear nothing from her over the course of two months. This isn't unusual, seeing as we never communicated outside of work before, but I think it's a little strange considering that she was so determined to spend time with me when I said I was quitting.

I stop by work on my day off and she nearly knocks me over when she comes to give me a hug. This is completely unexpected by me because even though we talked a hell of a lot, we never really had any physical contact. She tells me how much she's missed me and had no one else to talk to, and if I'm going to the Christmas party at the end of the month. I hang around for a few hours while we chat and leave when she goes to her other job. Later that night, she texts me saying that it how it was so nice to see me and that she's going to the Christmas party and hopes to see me there.

I go to the Christmas party and we have a great time playing games and cards and eating shitty pizza. We both decide to leave at the same time and she gives me a ride home along with a couple other coworkers. We don't talk again at all until she texts me at work a  month later asking if she can borrow some money. I leave and come give her the money, thinking that it's kind of weird that we've been friends for over a year and I'm just now seeing what her house looks like. We talk for way too long considering that I'm supposed to be at work, but enjoy ourselves anyway.

Later that week, I stop at work on my day off and talk to her for a while before leaving for unrelated reasons. Another month passes with no communication before I stop to see her again, and this time she hardly notices I'm there. The only time that she says something to me is when I outright ask her how she's been, and even then the conversation is uncharacteristically brief. I wonder if there's something on her mind that she's not telling me, seeing as that would explain why she seems so quiet. I decide to not bother and leave her alone.

That weekend I show up to her work after being asked to fill in for someone. Seeing as I had nothing better to do, I take the offer. Unlike last time I was there, my friend seems to be acting like her normal self. We talk for a bit while I work and I go up front to hang around. She tells me that she's going to go home and watch a movie and was wondering if I'd like to swing by after work. I tell her I'd love to and wait for her to call me like she said she would. I never get the call. 

That was a couple weeks ago.  I just can't help but feel like all of these offers to spend time with her aren't legitimate offers but rather her faking interest in spending time with me. I wish that there was some way that I could tell her this without coming off as uncaring or needy, but I just don't feel like there's a way to tell her this without coming off as an asshole in one way or another.

Thanks to those that read this or answer. This has been on my mind a lot as of late and it feels good to get it off of my chest."

ff,"Should I cut my losses & move on?
I have a co-worker & friend that I’ve gotten to know really well since we started working together almost 2 years ago. He seemed a bit socially awkward so I befriended him. We started hanging out & we shared some pretty deep things with each other. He’s not big on emotions but he said he just feels comfortable talking to me about things. 

However, he’s a self proclaimed “bad” friend. He wants friendships on his rules, his terms & there is no real sense of urgency in getting back to you.  He’ll not text me back for days. When I check on him he tells me I shouldn’t worry (I’m a worrier by nature). He says he doesn’t owe me anything yet tells me I’m one of the only people who has ever shown him unconditional love in a friend sort of way. 

One of my biggest pet peeves is when people ignore me. Im sure he knows that & he does it on purpose at times. But, I also know that’s just who he is based on how other co-workers talk about him at work. I can be very overbearing at times myself. I try not to be but I get really insecure about our friendship if he just ignores me; like I did something wrong to warrant being ignored??!? 

I just feel like this friendship is so up & down. He has no regard for my feelings or how his actions make me feel. He thinks emotions are dumb. He says they just cause problems & people get hurt. He literally almost never shows emotion in any situation. However, I have seen him cry before & I know he is capable of loving someone. He claims he has no love to give because he has such a poor opinion of himself. 

I’ve never had a friendship that has been this difficult to maintain. I always feel like I’m doing something wrong. It’s like walking on eggshells. I’m thinking about just ending the friendship but we still work together. I tend to get VERY passive aggressive when I am hurt. I know I will start to get that way at work toward him while he will be as polite & professional as can be because that’s how he is. He controls his emotions SO well. I just don’t know what to do...

TL; DR- thinking of ending a friendship with a co-worker after becoming very close, feels like walking on eggshells."

ff,"Family problems
Hello, I want to talk about things in my household now, and maybe get some opinions on it.
Okay, so my sister is 22, she's the oldest. I'm 14, the middle child, and my brother who's 12 is the youngest. Our dad works abroad and comes back a few times a year. But we talk on phone almost everyday. My sister studies in a university and comes back usually on weekends and then maybe some other days depending on her schedule. 
When she comes back everyone in the house starts fighting and she's the problem. When she's home, everything we do is wrong. We were ""raised"" wrong. Mom ""spoils"" us. Mom doesn't ""love"" her. We ""don't want her here"". And when my mom says that she causes the problems she bursts into tears, goes to her room, cries for a bit and leaves to her boyfriends house because ""she feels loved there"". And that's how it always goes. She comes back, says that my brother doesn't do anything in this is house and that he's a spoiled brat, fights over something, bursts into tears and leaves. She is very emotional. When she accuses my brother of something and he calls her some kind of name she immediately stars crying like it's the end of the world. 
Last night she texted my mom, saying that she raised us poorly and that mom doesn't love her. She said that she's gonna be leaving our home and won't come back because ""we don't want her there"". 
Of course, me, as  the peace maker in the family, wrote her a huge message about how she is wrong, how we actually love her is just that she doesn't see it and everything else. She wrote back, about how I'm wrong, about how my brother is spoiled and again, everything else.
I will agree, my brother is the youngest and he can be a brat. But that's the point, he's the youngest. And I don't see how you can make a problem out of everything. Like dude chill oml you're not dying. Guys, how the hell do we make her understand. Or maybe she should leave? Get some time alone? Maybe understand herself better? But she's an almost adult, she should be the smart one, she one that understands."
ff,"How should i deal with angry best friend
Hi guys so basically in the past year ever since I started dating a boy (he was my best friend for the most part in high school) my current best friend (a girl in my friendship group also from highshcool) and i have gotten into many fights .

These fights are mainly about her arguing that she is no longer my number one priority and that she is just second priority to my boyfriend . I do not think this is true and they are both important to me but In very different ways - he in a romantic way and she in a friendship way.

She recently came back from overseas and I organised to meet up with her and we did. I never heard from her initiating a meet up for the next few weeks or so but I finally did initiate a catch up with her after hearing nothing from her for weeks. however this plan fell through because I ended up having a work shift. 

Yesterday my best friend had invited me to catch up with her before she went to work (she had work at 1pm)and I messaged her asking if we could hang out until 12pm. She asked me why I couldn’t stay until 1 with her till she had to go to work and I explained it’s bevause I had invited my boyfriend over for lunch and movies at my house (this catch up with my boyfriend was meant to be another day but got postponed to the same day as my catchup with my best friend due to him getting sick). 

She got very angry and told me she now does not want to see me at all and cancelled the catchup because she said she felt second priority. She said She shouldn’t have to change her plans for my boyfriend who I see so much more compared to her (I would love to see her more but she never plans anything with me or when I do ask her when she’s free she always has family plans ?) 

She also brought up the previous weeks events of me cancelling our plans due to me having work and got angry with me for never trying to find another day to make up for these cancelled plans 

I tried explaining to her how important she is to me and how I don’t see her as second priority or never meant to make her feel like second priority but she is giving me silent treatment or being passive aggressive .

I am tired of having to prove to her that she is important to me and I am tired of this drama .

My boyfriend is so wonderful and he is always there for me and replies to me instantly and we share many things on a personal level (emotionally physically etc) so to me it seems natural that I will try and adjust my plans to try and accommodate him - as he does so much for me that nobody else does, not even my best friend. 
so I don’t understand why she expects to be higher in priority than my bf and isn’t happy with being the same priority as him? 

I am tired and confused. Don’t know how to respond to her passive and blunt messages to me after I tried apologising and explaining

ff,"I don't trust my in-laws with my daughter.
I just don't. It's hard to explain. Maybe I'm paranoid. Maybe I'm old-fashioned.

Bottom line is: Their lifestyles, comments to me, comments about my kids, bad tempers, alcohol intake, drug use, and pasts instill in me no confidence that they can be responsible caretakers of my daughter.

I hear so many stories of child abuse -- sexual abuse, especially. From family members, most often. I'm just not comfortable taking that risk. I'm not afraid to offend my in-laws. But other family members say I'm being unreasonable.

ff,"Cheap gifts on the Receiver's side
My friend and I are friends for about 5 years. We ended up going to different colleges, but kept in contact online. I think of them as my best friend, but i'm not sure if it is reciprocated. 

Every year I stress about giving a good gift for their birthday and xmas. A gift too expensive makes them feel uncomfortable by setting expectations. A gift too cheap devalues our friendship and being on the receiving end feels terrible. 

I purchased their birthday gift is about $12 (Lush soap), and the Christmas gift is about $8-10 (sweets). The price of the cards are not included. 

They got me a small notepad that looked like it came from the dollar store for my birthday, and a couple stickers for Xmas. There was no card included or even a piece of paper that had my name on it.  

Last year they got me a $15 gift with the receipt for my birthday. My gifts were around the same value (~$15).

I try not to place too much importance on the price tag, since it is the thought that counts, but their gift to me is really cheap (~$1-2), and looked like it was slapped together an hour before we met. I know they can afford to buy a gift. They buy coffee every couple days and bought lunch to the point where the staff remembered their order. 

I accepted their gift, but it was really hard to avoid showing my disappointment. I honestly thought it would of been better if they just didn't give me a gift at all.

Is this a sign? Are they trying to tell me something or do they really think of me so little? I'm not sure what they are thinking or what should I do. 

I know giving them a similarly cheap gift is an option, but I would rather know why they thought to give me this gift. I could also brush this off as a one time thing, but I think that this is not the case."

ff,"Letter To Dad - Christian Fatherhood
Author Kent Nerburn once wrote, “It is much easier to become a father than to be one.” This rings true, even for those men who really want to be a father. With enough hard work and determination we can master a career, a hobby, or a sport but it is difficult to even control anything in fatherhood, let alone master it. When the baby starts crying, how do we make her stop? When our son starts failing classes in school, how do you motivate him and help him with both the drive and the subject matter? Fatherhood is slow and daunting work.

ff,"My best friend of 11 years got engaged and I wasn’t invited.
So, I just don’t know how to feel it’s not her fault that I wasn’t invited or told about it. Her fiancé didn’t bother to call us (my other best friend and I). He had his family, her family, his best friends, and their amway business partners(that’s a whole other hot mess). But anyway, I  was working and got a phone call from an old friend and asked me how excited i was that my best friend was getting engaged. I replied “I had no idea.” She just said, “Oh..” I’m so hurt. But I don’t really think her man cares. He doesn’t like me and our other friend for reasons unknown to me. Now I’m asking myself will I even be invited to the wedding? Because I doubt I’ll be a bridesmaid. Idk I feel crazy for being hurt but. I’ve known this girl since I was 16 and I’ve know her man for 6 years. Why wouldn’t you even let us know that you were going to do this?? A text would’ve sufficed.. *sigh* really trying not to dwell on this but it really makes me hurt inside."
ff,"What's the deal with my husband's future best friends wife?
Hi everyone, I am having a problem and I'm not sure what to do about it. I am led to believe that my future husband's (married next month) best friend's wife dislikes me, but I'm getting mixed signals. I have always (I thought) been nice to her. 

When we hang out as couples, everything is fine and we get along great. We have a similar education level and both come from a science background, so it's easy for us to talk. We have spent hours hanging out in these situations. We even all took a road trip together this past summer a few states away to attend a very lovely (albeit very strange) wedding of another of their mutual friends, and we went out to dinner and shopping while the boys were at the bachelor party. 

It seems like whenever I try to plan anything though, she isn't available, even if her husband is. I planned a surprise party for my fiances 30th birthday that I had been talking about for months--her husband was there, and at the last minute, she couldn't attend. He didn't even tell me she wasn't coming until he showed up without her. We visited their home on 4th of July weekend and there invited them to my parents house (they have a pool) for the holiday. He showed up, she didn't because she was ""sick"" (read: hungover.) Her husband showed up for an hour or so and she was continually calling him asking when he was going to come home and take care of her. 

The thing that makes me think this isnt a string of coincidences is my bridal shower. It is tomorrow, and I have found out she will not be attending. She Rsvpd to my mom with just a generic ""I can't make it, we're busy"" but then a few days later, her husband messaged my fiance asking if he wanted to hang out on the day of my shower.

I have always been nice to her, and I'm not sure whats going on. Anyone in Reddit land have any advice? Her husband and my future husband have been best friends since high school and this is bugging both of us."
ff,"Should i bother what best friend think about me?
I feel like garbage, i have no friends. When im with others, i try to be interesting, and funny, never harm others or depress others with sad stuffs. I think with friends you can loose up and be yourself. But my BEST friend have something problem with me. I think he dont like who i am, how i behave.

Sometimes he notices something about me. What i should have said, or done...like a mother see how her children behave. There was time when he bashed me because i was silent, or because i asked a question about our mutual FRIEND. This weekend we would held a little surprise party to our friend but he said to me, behave and be nice. If i was wrong or bad.

Nobody ever told me if i said, done something wrong. Never. He every time say something. He is very sumbissive to others, always go after others. And if he dont like someone, he always talks behind his/her back to me. He has friends i dont. And i feel a sack of ... because of this. I starting to have enough about how he wants me to behave within FRIENDS and pushing this ""you are bad"" feeling to me. I think this is not friendship, he is not my friend. If you are friend with someone, you like him/her who the person is. If i cant be myself within friends, i cant be myself elsewhere.

Stepped back from this party, and said im sick. This weekend felt bad because of him. What should i do?

ff,"Family Vacation. Is this rude?
My fiancé' and I are headed to a family vacation at an amusement park for six days with his family. There's no set schedule, except for one family dinner and one family breakfast.  Everyone is in different life stages, so it was best to let everyone venture off on their own.  I figured we'd coordinate events and rides with folks once we got there but nothing set in stone. 

My cousin lives there, about 25 minutes from where we are staying and I haven't seen her in years since she moved due to bad timing and life events. We were going to go meet her for dinner one evening (probably about an hour or so) during the trip. 

Is this rude?  I mentioned it to my MIL and she didn't look happy and I felt like she was biting her tongue.

ff,"Drug addict friend!!?
I have had this best friend for over 8 years now. We were childhood friends and basically grew up together. The past 2 years were a little rough because he started to drink heavily in high school. Later on he started to dabble into drugs  and the “party life”. Once he started doing that, I kind of distanced myself because I didn’t know how to react. I was kind of mad but also sad so I didn’t really talk to him as much. Fast forward to now, I talk to him more but I don’t know if it will ever be the same. He is always talking about trying new drugs and doing all this stuff at parties which tbh I don’t really care for. Should I still attempt to have that relationship we once had? I still care for him but it’s so hard to listen and be there for him when he’s putting himself in dangerous situations. If I stop being friends with him, does that make me a bad friend for not sticking through it? Should I stay friends to try and make a positive environment? HELP ‪"

She says Im not nice like I used to be. She was like the older I get the more understanding i should be. She also feels like I should seek wealth. But that's not something I want. I want personal growth and wisdom and strength. I know a lot may disagree and say money is what matters. Yes it does. But it's a tool. Also, I do dislike my mother because she messed up my head as I grew up. She always told me her issues. Parents should never tell kids their issues. I am 22 now and she feels like she can still change the way I am. But in my opinion, the first three years is what shapes most of a person. I want to move out.

ff,"My friend is ruining her frienships
I'm not really sure what to do here.
My best friend, let's call her Sam, has lost a lot of friendships recently. And I mean a lot. In the past two years, she's lost almost every close friendship she's ever had. The count is in the double digits. Something would happen and she'd declare them dead to her and never speak to them again. Unfortunately, I find myself usually feeling like it's Sam's fault that the friendships are crumbling.
Recently, she's started shamelessly using her friends. One girl worked as a seamstress at a community theater in her free time and Sam would constantly arrive unannounced and drop off clothes she wanted tailored, imposing absurd timeline, even saying she'd be back that night to pick the dresses up. When her friend finally asked Sam to start paying, Sam announced to everyone that their friendship was over and that she refused to associate with someone who didn't view her as a friend.
She's started yelling at people for not texting her more. She called one of her now former friends, an elementary school teacher, and yelled at her for not responding to her texts about where they were going to get dinner that night. She wanted to make sure she didn't eat the same type of food for lunch. The teacher cancelled and they haven't spoken since.
And unfortunately, with each new friend lost, her demands on those remaining have become more and more extreme. Her need for attention has gotten out of hand. She demands that we all hang out four nights a week and constantly accuses people of not valuing her friendship enough if they can't make it. One friend spent every night with her one week trying to show Sam that she mattered. When the friend didn't continue that schedule the next week, Sam screamed at them for pulling away and called her a coward for not just ending it if she didn't want to be friends.
Worst of all, she accuses people of saying things they've never said, claiming that she's stupid, she can read between the lines. And when people try to explain that they never intended to hurt or upset her, she claims that it doesn't matter what they said. What matters is how she was made to feel.
It shouldn't come as a surprise that Sam has serious self-esteem issues. She's in therapy and has been for a while, trying to work on them. Unfortunately, she goes back and forth between crying that no one knows how hard it is to live with ""being such a failure"" and accusing others of not being deserving of her friendship.
I want to be there for her. I want to help. She's been my best friend and she used to be able to be there for me, but I'm not sure I can handle who she's become and how she's started treating us.
tl;dr: My friend has serious self-esteem issues and is ruining all of her friendships because she treats everyone like absolute garbage. She's getting therapeutic help but I'm not sure I'm able to stick around long enough for things to get better."

 Hi everybody! First time posting over here, so let's go. What would you think of a friend who discusses everything with other friends?

Recently we had a fight and I know she has been telling some of our mutual friends about it. I firmly believe that if two persons have a problem they should talk it out between them without having to involve other people. This way of acting is only driving me further away from her.

My sister and I are visiting our parents this weekend - celebrating a family holiday. Overall it’s been a lot of fun, but this evening, there is a particular tv show that my sister and mom wanted to watch.

Sister begged to get the “comfortable chair”. Mom and dad are sitting in their respective chairs. My choices are the folding chair or the floor. Also, sister’s devices are taking up the only proximate outlet, and I only have 10% on my phone battery. 

I am exhausted - it’s been a fun weekend but there was a lot of planning and I haven’t had much sleep. I’d really prefer to go upstairs to the bedrooms. My mom really wants me to sit with them... but I’m just too exhausted. I don’t want to spend an hour and a half on a folding chair OR on the floor. I don’t want to watch this TV show - they can watch it but I’m just not interested. I especially don’t want to spend an hour and a half in an uncomfortable chair, watching a TV show I don’t care about, with a dead phone battery.

So I’m in the kitchen right now, with my phone plugged into an outlet. Debating how angry my family will get if I go upstairs and lay down. Debating if I even have enough energy to stay awake for another hour and a half.

ff,"My wife wants another baby, I don't. Are we headed for divorce?
Hi all,  I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this so let me know if it's not.  The title pretty much is why I'm here but let me give you some background.  

My wife and I dated for about a year before she got pregnant.  We quickly got married and had our first girl in 2005.  In 2008 we had our son, followed by our third, another girl, in 2009.  We were crazy busy for a while there and things finally calmed down a few years ago.  We made up for that by deciding that we should move to a nicer area.  We live in Vancouver where property costs a fortune.  To afford that, my wife had to go back to work full time.  She had been working 3 days a week.  She is a teacher so she still gets the summers, Christmas and spring break at home with the kids.  She kind of half joked about having a fourth child before the move but when we moved it was clear that we couldn't afford another baby.

Now we've been in our new home for about 1.5 years.  The kids have made new friends, settled into their new school and sports teams.  Our oldest will be heading to high school next year.

Now my wife wants a new baby.  She is obsessed with it.  It's all she thinks about and all she talks about.  She says the kids are getting older and they're not going to need her soon and she's getting depressed about it.  Every couple weeks it boils over and we fight or she bursts into tears again.

I don't want another baby.  Our youngest is 8, our oldest is 12.  I don't want to go back there.  I've moved on from the baby stage and I love where we're at right now.  We are crazy busy with sports and activities most of the year (hockey x2, baseball x3, swimming, art class, etc....).  I am happy where we are, I don't feel like anything is missing, there's no hole in my life.

If we were to have another baby, we'd have to move again.  Change the kids schools again.  Have the kids meet new friends again and join new sports teams again.  I don't want to do that to them.  I've also been carrying the financial burden for the last 12 years as my wife had finally give back to work full time.  I'm not saying she wasn't working at home taking care of the kids, she was.  I am saying that if we missed a mortgage payment, that was on me and it's stressful and it's nice to have some sort on that department once again.

I don't really know what to do, I'm afraid we're headed for a divorce but that's the last thing I want.  Should I have a baby so she won't divorce me?  What if we're in the same spot eight years from now when the baby starts to grow up a bit.  I asked her if she would go speak to a counselor with me but she says it won't change her mind that she wants another baby."
ff,"Need advice on helping a friend escape an abusive dad
A week ago, my best friend Jake (not his real name) confided in me that he has been physically and emotionally abused by his father since childhood. We are both 17 years old and we have been best friends for 4 years. I was really shocked when I found out because everyone in our high school friend circle sees him as extremely seemingly cheerful and upbeat. I'm his best friend, and I never suspected anything was wrong. 
This morning, he texted me saying that he was running away from home. He told me he left his home with a backpack full of clothes and $100 that he had secretly saved up without his dad's knowledge. I'm very worried about him. On the one hand, I think he should get out of that dangerous situation as soon as possible. On the other hand, I think it will be very difficult for him to survive on his own with so little money. Any advice on how I could help him as a friend?"
ff,"Might have gotten my friend fired at work
First of all: hello! 

I’m just gonna jump right in. So I (23/f) have been best friends with this girl (let’s call her maya) for about 3 1/2 Years now. Another girl (we will go with Ashley) became part of our group about a year later and maya asked us to start working at the restaurant she served at part time. 
Eventually, maya started a thing with this guy who was in a relationship at the time, so we obviously didn’t really put a lot of hope into the whole thing. But eventually he broke up with the other girl to be with maya. Now she started really getting into weed (like 3 blunts a day all by herself) and then dropping pills on the weekends. Ashley and I are not into it so we stayed away but tried to still hang out but it got more and more difficult being with her because she either a) fell asleep b) throw up all the time c) was just super uncomfortable to be around. 
Also work got fucking disastrous because she asked us to pick her up and every single time she either overslept or just forgot about it... so we were always late with her. 
Last week it really excalated: she left Ashley hanging for over an hour, didn’t pick up her phone, I cancelled all my plans to go to work instead of maya and or coworker was all by himself with a huge group of guests. And all she did was send us a voice mail telling us what we should tell our boss. (Not even a reason why all of it happened)
Obviously, we were both really pissed and I just told our superior what had happened and why I was there instead of her. Needless to say he was mad and said that our boss has to talk to her about this because it obviously just a big no go. 
The issue is, she kind of expected us to lie for her and I don’t think I can deal with that anymore. She has become so enstranged lately and I don’t want to support her selfish and self-destructive behaviour. But now I guess I might have made her lose her job and i don’t know if I should apologise and try to talk our boss into letting her stay or just accept that she’ll hate me forever and go on with my life. 
I’ve told her that I don’t like the whole drug thing but she laughed it off, called me a coward and sheltered. But she also treats me (and Ashley to an extend) like her servants and all my other friends can’t stand to be around her. 
So really, i don’t know how to approach her with the whole situation because in the end I’m going to be the horrible friend that ruined her life. Should I apologise or/and try to damage control the whole thing at work? 

TLDR: friend has drug problem and left all of us hanging at work again so i didn’t play along with the hundredth shitty excuse She wanted us to tell"

So my cousin has stopped talking to any of our family including his mother and brother. I just assumed it was just life getting in the way, but recently my dad tried to contact this cousin about some money he loaned him to buy my old car (which I sold to him well under half of market value), because my dad needed the money to pay for a surgery (he has stage 4 liver cirrhosis). My cousin never replied and money aside I can tell this really hurt my dad (he's bottling it, but I can tell) considering this is my Dad's favorite nephew. I feel like this is my cousin throwing a bit of a tantrum over having to be an adult (he just barely turned 19) and I texted him to call me when got off work to explain how serious my fathers illness is (our grandma died of the same condition) and how he shouldn't cut off his uncle who has done a lot for him, but it's been 3days already. My main motivation for this is that I know stage 4 cirrhosis can move to end stage very suddenly and I want my dad to have as few regrets and worries during what may be God forbid his last few years. I just wanted to talk about this. Advice is very welcome and before anyone suggests he doesn't have the money, he does, he just sold the car we sold him for above market value and has a very good paying job as a mechanic at a car dealership."

Let me apologize by the rather lengthy post:

I’m not sure where to start. Recently, I’ve been having trouble with my friends and I’m not sure why. I had a childhood friend since Elementary school, we would hang out often and now she’s a stranger. She would say she was busy, but the last day I texted her, my dad had kidney surgery because he had cancer in his kidney. They removed the whole kidney and the day he got home, I texted my childhood friend that he was home and he was doing okay. She couldn’t even take one second to respond “I’m glad your dad is okay?” That was it for me, I had to remove her on Facebook after she had to replied after a week, two weeks, etc. and I believe I deleted all messages on my cell phone, and I’m not sure what happened ! Then this “friend” of mine, never messages me on either Instagram  or Facebook. I think it began when I told her I asked out one of her friends a year ago (we are still friends, the girl I asked out), and from then she started not to respond to me. So, recently I told my friend who I asked out, about the communication between me and her friend. She told me that her friend, (who is also her roommate)  that they’re both extremely busy, which I understand, but and that “she” loves me, and doesn’t hate me (my friend who doesn’t respond, and not love in a boyfriend way.) But, if this is the case why doesn’t she communicate with me online? Even when I see her, she waved hi to me and we talk a bit, but it’s not the same. There were times in the past where she use to hug me a lot, any time she saw me. But something has changed with her and me, I can tell. I think my friend (the girl I asked out), is unaware of my “friend’s” (her roommates) , true feelings toward me, and I mean that in a bad way. I’m just not sure where I went wrong...."
ff,"My Story of Elder Abuse: Internet Romance Scams and the devastating consequences
I'm living a nightmare watching a woman 50 years younger than my 80-year-old father coerce him into marriage, manipulate him and taking his money all in the name of ""love"". The relationship started as Ghanaian romance scam (usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/romance-scams/) and after we uncovered it was a male in Ghana pretending to be an American woman, it eventually led to a Ghanaian woman residing in Cuba, showing up at my father's doorstep and coercing him into marriage two weeks later. The story is long, complex, and out of this world so I won't go into it here. We've tried it all: FBI, USICE/immigration, State Dept., AARP, private investigators, the District Attorney, police, adult protective services, elder abuse attorney's and filing for conservatorship. 

The harsh reality I'm learning is though the crime is so blatantly obvious to everyone, I'm told over and over by the authorities that individuals have the right to abuse themselves. My father is showing serious signs of dementia but his executive functioning is still intact and we cannot get him to see a neuropsychologist without a long and painful court battle. 

To the outside world, he comes across as just fine, but my normally mild-mannered, extremely rational and brilliant father has had explosive and violent episodes, personality changes, impulsive behavior, and has been unduly influenced and taken advantage of over an over again. He cannot see that people are lying to him even though the lies are later revealed to him. I've had a huge reality check just how powerful civil liberties to make bad decisions are in the USA along with the financial rights that coexist in marriage, no matter how corrupt. 

I'm not writing for advice since I know in my heart my father is not well and is no longer the father I know and love. What I want to know is if anyone else out there has experienced elder financial abuse in their family, and romance scams or partner abuse in particular. I want to hear your story. I am appalled that though financial elder abuse is rampant throughout the USA, and internet romance scams are only on the rise, there seems to be no major initiatives or policies to protect our vulnerable elders. 

Thank you."

My mother died recently. She had a retirement account and life insurance. I have two siblings. The benefits are being paid and She left me much more then them. I received about 50-60% of her money.

I was the only one around for my mom for more then 15yrs. She got cancer three years ago along with other illnesses and suffered a great deal. I was the only one here to help. Her last year and a half was very tough and I was her full time caregiver. I gave up a everything. As a business owner I Lost most my clients, compiled a mountain of debt and now I am alone to care for her house ( I gave up my place) and pay the mortgage. One sibling says it's unfair that I got more then twice him. The conversation killed me because I think he is hurt by it and I feel guilty. My mom told them before she died that I got the lions share but he says he didn't think it was this much of a disparity. I don't know what to do or how I should feel.

ff,"A Long Story
So here’s the situation I was and still sort of am in a group of four friends (friends for about 3 years). One of our four was a new girl who we added to the group about half of a year ago. But a few weeks ago three of us pranked the new girl’s best friend, it did not go well and suddenly the NG stopped hanging out with our group (we hangout but mostly play games online).

But what I wouldn’t learn till the following week was that she wasn’t hanging out with me and rest of the group was hanging out her behind my back. They lied about having things to do, or saying the were simply to busy to spend time together. When we did hangout the other two and I they both acted odd and withdrawn, I attempted to dig into why and even asked if it specifically related to NG but I got backlash for doing so so I let up. However later I learned about her not wanting/being to hangout with me was a “intervention” where the three of them sat me down and told me that NG’s BF old her that She couldn’t be friends with me anymore because her BF told her that it was all my fault and she had to choose between me and her BF in addition I learned that why my friends had been harsh and avoided me earlier in the week, they had lied to me about the whole situation. They knew about the ultimatum that NG’s BF gave her the whole week and decided not to tell me till now, they claim it was to save my feelings but it didn’t come off that way. The “Intervention” ended with her leaving and me leaving as well.

The next couple of weeks are bad not only is our group divided, I am the odd man out they spend the bulk of their time with NG and ignore me for the most part. So I confront my two friends (one I’ve been friends with for five years and the other three), I tell them it’s unfair that I am getting the short end of this situation when she made the decision to break up the group, I also tell them that the fact that they were willing to lie and go behind my back is wrong and that they justify it by claiming that NG is the victim because she lost a friend (so did I). They have apologized for the lying and going behind my back but I told them that I don’t feel comfortable with them spending time with her and being friends with all the problems she caused me and their easy willingness to lie for her to me. They tell that they will always be friends with her and that I can’t ask them to cut her off because it would divide the group, even though she already divided the group by pushing me out and they did nothing about it as a matter of fact the backed her up and supported her decision. So I told them that I have too walk away from the group then because I don’t feel valued, respected, or able to trust them after what they have done.

Am I in the wrong? What should I do should I walk away? I don’t want to throw away my two closest friends but I feel like they don’t even care about me anymore.

My sister is 30 years old and still refers to our parents as ""mummy and daddy"". I can't be the only one to find this totally cringey?? I could understand more if it was directed at them but it's to others to when talking about them. Today we went for a meeting with our landlord and discussing the smell of weed coming from the flat below. When she said ""I don't mind it so much myself, but it's just more when mummy and daddy come to visit I don't want them to be smelling it in the hall"". 
I felt like disappearing into the ground😒
Just me?"
ff,"I didn't want have to post this, but I have to get it off my chest (I don't expect to get sympathy from this, but closure)
I have a cousin, who i've known for 13 years, and over time... He became more and more distant, he got friends, most of them were verbally abusing me, you would think he would defend me, but he backed up his friends, than his own blood, me

growing up, I was (and still to this day) an introvert, and I never kept a close friend, because they would either stop talking to me, or they would say that they don't like me

and for the 3 years that I have known his friends, they eventually got used to me, and we played online frequently, and 2 months ago, they disapproved of me getting a GTA Shark Card (in game currency) then they insult me saying I need to grow up, and mature, basically telling me how to run my life, and I tried to stand up for myself, but they still kept saying it

Its my life, if I want to act silly, then I will, but the main focus is my cousin, and how he was brutally honest, you know how we hype up our friend to make them feel good about himself/herself?

That's not what he did, every time we play online with one of his friends, he would agree and add insult to injury when his friend makes fun of me, in games... He would tell everyone to go after me, in CoD, he would tell everyone to go to his lobby because he's the ""leader""

but the sole reason I'm making this post, was the fact that he did one of, if not, the RUDEST thing ever, here's how it went

it was my sister's birthday, I was texting, and he said that he's coming to the party, and I'm pretty happy, a smile stretches around my face, I say ""OK cool, :)""

an hour passes by, and he nonchalantly says, ""welp sorry I can't come, oh well"" and I ask why? And he says I don't know, now usually, most would tell the reason why can't come, or if they don't they make up something, but he all of a sudden says, I can't come

I want you keep in mind that, the last time I was in his house, was 4 years ago, and he has only came over for my birthdays or sometime in the fall, so he RARELY comes to my house, and I'm not even allowed back at his house, because of personal reasons

but anyway, he couldn't come to my house, but has time to go to his friends house WHENEVER he wants... Gee? I wonder why? -_-

he did what no other friend should have done, and hurt my feelings all in one fell swoop.

I'm done with him, but if he asks for forgiveness, should I ignore him, accept his apology? I'm not expecting an answer but whatever...."
ff,"A good friend who I feel is brushing me away.
I used to like my best friend(she did not know I like her) but she was involved in a relationship ( a long distance one). Around early October, I stopped liking her but still talks to her like nothing happened and still acts as a good friend and recently, she broke up with her boyfriend. I don't know why but by the way she chats with me through the phone, its like she is putting me off or just ignoring me but when we meet f2f, she acts like nothing happened, so what should I do? I feel like waiting it out and act like nothing happened is the best way to go about this"
ff,"Money and power are your friend, not human beings!
I am cynical about friendship from my recent experience. 

I am from a well-off family but I’d tried to live by my own and lived in a very tiny studio. To my well-off friends, I might look humble. They partied, traveled, and dined together without me, and kept those in secret (some of those events were blurted by mutual friends). Especially one of them frequently ignored me. When I really needed someone in order to be discharged from a hospital, that person didn’t help me even though she could - she didn’t even hide it. 

My parents didn’t like me living in a small place rent, so they bought me a very nice condo. Those well-off friends learned this news and they were excited about it. The woman who’d been ignoring me and hadn’t helped me out, volunteered to help my moving. I refused. When I had a house warming with them, they saw my place and was anxious to be invited to any of my future parties at this new place (yes, it’s a really nice place.)

And then, they started to invite me to their exclusive parties and dining gatherings. They even asked me why I put some distance from them. It was ridiculous. Why did you guys act like you’d been caring about me so much? 

Life has taught me that my true friends are money and power, not human beings."
ff,"My friend is a douchebag
I don’t know what to do about my friend. I guess you could say he is the “leader” of our friend group. Because of this, no one does anything when he pulls a dick move. Everyone seems to worship him. He never thinks anything is his fault, even when he can do the most fucked up thing. He has no respect for anyone, he’s extremely rude. I can’t trust the guy cause he’ll share your secrets to the whole group (including you) just to be funny. He’s a major hypocrite. He bullies my other friend. This guy has been pretty much my best friend for a very long time, and I don’t know what to do. He says I’m his best friend, and it seems like that when it’s only me with him, but when there are other people there, he just leaves me in the dust, even though he always complains about when his friends hang out with someone else (like I said he’s a hypocrite). He makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit sometimes. I want to stop being friends with this guy, but he’s friends with all of my other friends. I can’t even seem to get him out of my life if I even try (our parents are pretty good friends). I just don’t have no idea what to do. Any advice would be greatly apprecited. By the way I’m in high school."
ff,"what is going on with my mom?
As I've gotten older I identified something which was probably a source of a lot of neuroticism growing up, but I'm not really sure I'm in the right for noticing this. I have no idea what this is, I haven't met many other people that do this. But my Mom will do this thing where, the happier I get, the less comfortable she is around me. She tries almost frantically or rabidly to cut me off mid sentence or like ""steal my affectation."" Like mirroring that is a bit too eerily similar.  Its almost like a ""being a person contest."" I always feel like, gross afterward. Like someone got in my head and took a part of me then did a parody of it. It seems like nothing is going in, and only like warped versions of what I just said are coming out. Like her identity is being threatened or something. And it's only when I'm happy. She seems completely comfortable when I am depressed, and its still all out, no in. It's like she's doing a one man play. I mean I could be overthinking this, I just don't know. Is anyone skilled with like psychoanalysis or something? It seems surreal. I've rarely seen people do this. Am I doing something wrong? Like, am I not being a person right or something? She seems so unnerved by signs of happiness. It almost makes me feel fake or something. It legit feels like I'm beating her at tennis or something. Like the more emotion I am feeling naturally, she tries to one up me. And hers does not feel natural. It makes me uneasy. Is there a reason a person would do this? I really am eager to know what this is or how I can avoid it or make ends with it."

ff,"Are friendship ultimatums a good or bad thing?
I have this friend who've I've been friends with for about 7 years. She moved across the country and is depressed for not knowing anyone she can be friends with. She's been making me feel bad about not going there to visit her. I've told her several times, I'm broke and have school obligations. Every time we talk, she brings up how she misses me and just needs a hug, and have someone (me) brush her hair, and hang out  with her. 
    Recently, I've found out that she feels there's an inequity in our friendship over the past year; because I haven't gone to visit her. I personally feel I've been there for her and her child whenever she needed me and dropped everything and go see her whenever her and her ex-husband and ex-best friend would have a fight. 
   About two months ago, my S.O. made a bad joke and she ended up lashing out on him and making a comment about a subject that I told her in confidence, and ended up hurting me as a result. We talked about it, and tried to go back to normal. But, I realized, that I'm still hurt by her comment and told her that. She then says she's going through a lot right now and can't deal with me going back and forth on my feelings. So she said I need to ""figure my shit out"" and let her know if we can move past this or end our friendship.
   I've been doing some thinking and I'm torn on whether or not to try to get over this feeling of betrayal, or just completely end the friendship all together. 

TLDR; My friend gave me an ultimatum to decide if I still want to be friends with her or not."

ff,"How to ask someone to move out.
TL:DR Friend has overstayed their welcome, how to politely ask her to leave?

4 months ago, my friend was going through a rough time.  She had split up with her partner and was struggling to find somewhere to live. My fiance and I own our home and had a spare room so offered her to stay, till her work contract was up in February, for a very very low rent (it's a quarter of what people pay in our area).  So now we're in february she has a renewed contract at work and isn't looking at places to live.  Little things she does around the house bug me, but thats probably just because its our home and not a shared rental.  However recently I've suffered a string of ill health (multiple hospital admissions) and now i'm home I just want my own space! She has cut her work hours to look for a new job but barely looks and just sits around the house.  I feel like i'm cleaning up after her all the time, plus she is always eating our food.  At the moment I am struggling to keep on top of my own mess let alone hers.  How can I go about asking her to move out without losing the friendship?"
ff,"Is my dad enabling my mom?
I have posted on multiple subs about my turbulent relationship with my mom, and I feel like I am afraid of her. I've gotten to a point where I jump when the garage door opens and she comes home from work. I think have become so irrationally afraid of my mom, that fear manifested today when I was going to pick my brother up from work and saw my mom coming the other way. I freaked out and ended up rear-ending another car, totaling mine (I am not hurt, don't worry.) Needless to say, this whole situation has caused chaos in my house and I am terrified to ever get behind the wheel again.

Tonight my dad called me out on me calling my mom ""abusive"" a few weeks ago. Bear in mind, neither she nor my dad has ever laid a finger on me, but my mom has emotionally abusive tendencies. She has said things to me that have fucked me up more than she can understand.

Here's a short list of some things she's done:

* If guilt tripping were an Olympic sport, let's just say she'd be Michael Phelps.
* She likes to ask me what's wrong when I'm upset and when I tell her, she cuts me off and says ""I don't want to talk about it.""
* She has criticized my weight for as long as I can remember. In her defense, her two sisters are 500 pounds apiece will both probably die before they reach 60, so she just wants me to be healthy and live long. But she's not helping. She's only making me want to cry into a Chipotle bowl.
* She liked comparing me to my best friend in high school (""Why can't you be more like her? She studies and gets good grades!"") Still does sometimes.
* To this day, she pesters me about my lack of religion. I remember when I was 11 and didn't want to go to Sunday School, she was like ""Do you want to be a heathen and go to hell?"" A couple years ago, she told me ""I just want you to go to Heaven when you die."" She even pestered me a week ago about having demons in my head.
* I thought I could confide in her about my sexuality but she quickly shot me down with ""How do you know? You've never been on a date before. That doesn't mean you're bi/gay!"" She also told me I am asexual and she's pretty much gaslighted me about my sexuality to the point where I don't know whether I am gay or straight anymore.
* I was diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD when I was a kid and she's basically used that diagnosis to keep me in a little bubble. I didn't get drivers' license until 18, didn't get my first job until 20, and I'm still perpetually single... all because my mom has used my diagnoses as a crutch. She still does, and after the accident, I don't fucking blame her!

Whenever I try to tell him about the things my mom says, he says things like ""What's wrong with motivating you to get better grades?"" or ""Your mom doesn't want you to end up like your sisters that she is going to bury because they're 500 pounds."" My mom is my bully, and he is her apologist.

I don't how much of this (if anything) constitutes abuse, but my dad doesn't buy any of it and blames it on ""liberal millennial indoctrinated safe-space snowflake bullshit... abuse is broken bones, black eyes and cigarette burns on arms."" He goes on about how he and mom have done everything for me and how there is something in my sick, twisted mind that is confusing ""constructive criticism"" with ""abuse.""

Deep down, I am beginning to resent my parents, because they *have* done everything for me, sheltered me and spoiled me to the point where I don't know how the world outside my little bubble works. I am 23 now and don't feel any better off now than I did when I was ten years ago. There are certain life skills I don't have because they did everything for me. I don't feel like I've ever had to work for anything and I hate them for it. They tried to be tougher with me but didn't have the spine. They never forced me to do anything except go to summer camps for special needs kids, they pretty much just let me raise myself and it's costing all of us dearly. Tonight is the night my real life begins.

Basically, if I am so afraid of my mom that seeing her on the road freaks me out to the point of an accident, something in our relationship has gone south. I don't know if it's her or me anymore."
ff,"Bed time and the tears...
Every night it is the same song and dance.

We have dinner, clean up, bath, games/tv, bed.

I say okay guys, wrap it up and go pee and get a sip of water it is bed time and the moans and groans begin.

It continually gets worse as we go up the stairs and get to the room. I have a 4, 7, and 8 year old and they like to sleep in the same room, it is a bunk bed.

My 7 year old is crying because she says she never gets to make choices and she can’t wait to be grown up and she isn’t tired, etc, etc.....

My youngest becomes kind of rowdy and doesn’t know where she is going to sleep or who she will sleep with.

My oldest is the best, he is actually ready for bed and just laying, waiting for the show to end.

I have a steady bed time each night, around 9:15. 

I am open to suggestions and new ideas. I am at my wits end with the night routine. It actually makes me really sad because no matter how much I do it is never enough for my children. I truly do want them to be happy. I give them several warnings before it is bed time to make sure they are doing what they want before the nights end."
ff,"How do I keep from being jealous of my very successful best friend?
So, I've been die-hard friends with this girl for about 4 years. Our friendship has been through SO MUCH during that time: the death of her father, relationships and breakups, we've worked several jobs together and lived together. We jokingly call each other ""husband and wife""!

She's an artist by practice and (through her inheritance) has the ability to not have to work a full time job and simply practice art. She's getting recognized internationally and is also just started as the creative director at a local female owned bar/art house.

I am SUPER excited to see her doing all these things and I ALWAYS go to the openings of her events and show support when I can. I have traveled with her to art shows and helped set up her booth.

Recently, I've had several bad dreams about her. In one dream, I was choking her and screaming in her face. In my dream last night, I was stalking her, trying to find out if she was ""cheating on me"".

I think what I'm most jealous of is her freedom while I'm chained to a desk job all day.

How do I address this so that I don't end up being resentful for her success! I feel like I'm being left behind.

TL;DR I'm jealous of my successful friend and want to stop."
ff,"What makes someone weird?
I've often been told by people (that like and don't like me alike) that I'm weird. I've become a guarded person because of it but I also embrace that others think of me as...unique. I am generally a confident person. I think I'm nice, genuine, smart and funny and have been told by others that I'm very attractive. What's always bothered me though is not quite knowing why people think I'm weird. I think this information could be useful for first impressions like dates or interviews so I know how to temper this a little. At least initially. The only thing I can think of is that I love horror movies. In general, my interests seem pretty average otherwise (shopping, reading, traveling, etc). So, what makes someone weird?"
ff,"Was this a true friendship? TL;DR (?)
A friend that I have know for 15 years just blocked me on facebook. I have always had feelings for her but I had began to move on. I don't have a lot of friends and I always liked having her as a friend and as someone I could go to. She was willing to do this with me even when she was dating someone else. As she got more serious with the other guy she started to talk to me less and less and she started to not chat with me as much about her life but she always wanted to hear about my problems and woes.

I really started to feel that something was wrong when she recently got married. We had talked about marriage a few times in previous years. She had indicated that she was unsure if she would ever get married then she said she was considering it with her bf. Then one day she moved to a the same city as her husband to be but when I asked her about why or if she was considering marrying him she said she moved because she liked it there more. She hid the fact that she was engaged from me but still allowed a friendship. I know that it shouldn't have mattered that she was getting married but I did want to be supportive of it and I also wanted to know because I felt that it would be unappropriate for us to be the same type of friends that we were. One day I called her to tell her some really bad news about something that had happened in my life. I called several times but she didn't answer because she was busy. She finally returned my call at midnight and got onto me for calling her so much and then said ""I can't do this"". Then she put severe restrictions on it saying that  I could only talk to her in sever circumstances or to tell her things but she would never initiate contact with me or make small talk with me. I got fed up and told her that it wasn't true friendship if she wouldn't reciprocate communication or tell me about major things in her life getting married. I also brought up some things from the past that made me feel the way that I feel towards her. Then she blocked me on facebook and told me that she wanted to discontinue all communication altogether.

 I feel like she knew that she had be wrong with me in the past but refused to admit it to me. Was this ever a true friendship? Am I wrong for feeling like my heart was torn out because of what she did? Is what she did OK from her end? Was she wrong or could she have been better about communicating this with me? I just don't know how to process what happened and I feel bad but I still feel that if I am going to call somebody a friend, I should be able to talk to them about life without limitation. I do know there are boundaries but just making small talk shouldn't violate a boundary. I am just looking for validation.

I still do care about her as a person. I don't think she's evil but I do think that she doesn't have much  compassion for me."
ff,"My bestfriend ruined my life.
So, I am a 21 year old girl. I go to college, it's my third year and it all started two, almost three years.
This girl, my ""best friend"" told me that her old friends from primary school came to see her and she invited me. I rejected it. I am very shy and anxious around people and she knew it. They were both boys, one of them being her old love interest and one of them... well. My future love interest, the man I thought my future. I've never been in a relationship, like I've said my depression and anxiety made me believe that I am not worth it and nobody is going to love me. So she asked that he wants to meet with me and how he can do that etc. I wanted to give my number to him, I told her that I would love to talk with him because she told me a lot about him. A basketball player -my favorite sports-, goes to San Francisco State University, loves motorcycles -like me- and wears all black -like me- and has blue eyes, dark hair etc. She told me that he doesn't use any social media, even his phone because he hated them as a kid too. I was like okay it's a oersonal preference. Like, at this point I wasn't serious. Because I didn't think he would like me. So I said let's try to talk with him because someone like him wouldn't like me anyway. 

On my 19th birthday I got an e-mail. 
It was from him. 

He was telling me happy birthday, how he wanted to write me and meet me. I was stupid, I flew with his message and we started talking. It was so beautiful. He was so sweet and kind. He was everything I wanted. Times go by, we decide to try ""us"" in a relationship. Mind you, until then I haven't seen him once, even though I asked to see his face. Not because I only care about physical stuff, because it was too good to be true. My mind, my mind wasn't accepting the fact that someone like him would like me. 

We started dating, talking each other 24/7 but without any Skype or calling. I haven't heard his voice once. One year passed, I totally fell in love, he told me he was in love and because of his family problems he couldn't open himself. 

Few things ruined me after our magical but almost ""it's nothing but a dream"" year. 
First he lied to me about visiting me 3 times. He told me that he gor the ticket and he was on the way to the airport. He never came. 
Second time I cried my heart out because of an accident. We were talking with my ""bestie"" the girl who met us, and she send me a conversation quotes. Her argument with one of her friends. When he sent an e-mail... The exact conversation she sent me was on the bottom of his mail. We used to send tons of hearts with each mail, I guess she forgot copying the hearts again. And sent me the conversation. 
Third time he decided to talk on Kik. You know after almost 1.5 years I wanted to speak normally, not with e-mails. I was so happy, I forgot everything he did to me, especially the mental abuse and fights about my male friends,  I said yes  open yourself to me, let me be with you etc. I was happy. A message came to me from an account with his initials. However without me having a chance to look at the message a notification about my bestie appeared on my phone, let's name her ""Aurora"" about opening a Kik account with his initials. I asked her what the fuck was going on and she told me it was a joke. 
He never send a message from Kik. 

Over time, my mental position got worse and worse. I'd hurt myself regularly, I'd cry at nights and I'd walk around without any emotions. 
Our friendship whit my ""bestie"" did end before me and he ended. When she got a new phone, her e-mail app gave an error. Until she fixed it he didn't mail me even once. Fourteen days. When her phone got fixed, he started writing me immediately. 

I knew it was her. I knew it was her from the beginning but I was too hopeful to believe that someone would love me. Now I'm here, with tons ıf new friends, friends I've made after her i, because her rude actions and poisonous words left us alone in the class. However I cannot deal with it. I still hope that he was real. I cannot stand the idea about a HUMAN BEING can do such a thing to a person she called as friend. I cannot deal with it. I would love to have some advice. It's been 2 weeks since my second semester has started but I cannot go to school because she will be there. And I am afraid I may hurt myself or worse, I may hurt her at some point."
ff,"I dropped an internet friend several months ago and I regret it.
I met her like almost 3 years ago. We were very close internet friends and would talk basically every day. She was amazing. In real life i had basically no friends. She was the only friend I had. I'm sure this led me to having unhealthy views on relationships. I still have unhealthy habits and feelings towards relationships. Anyways, the trouble began when on instagram, our main chatting platform, she began to gain friends from just common interests and such. She started posting screenshots of her friends and her dm conversations and how funny they were. She then would post screenshots of her group chat conversations and how funny they were. All of this would happen, and I would still be waiting for a simple reply. I didn't get it. I still don't really get it. I was there for her for so long. She didn't have many friends in real life or online either. But once she had gotten these new internet friends she would ignore me? She would reply up to three or four days later. She also made a whole separate account where she would post as well which she never even told me about and I had to find out myself when she spoke about it on her main account. I finally had enough and sent her a long explanation about my feelings and stuff and didn't speak to her after that. And the funny thing is that she didn't reply to my explanation for two weeks. And suddenly she was like "":( nooo pls :(("" etc
Typing all of this, I lowkey am getting annoyed..
I just want someone to smack some sense into me. Like it's been so long and I still think about her. It wasn't like she was a bad friend, but she just fuckin ignored me and basically left me. 
I usually think about her when I'm feeling lonely or my irl best friend starts to treat me like shit and ignores me.. but that's a different story...
Right now, I'm thinking about dming her and just having small talk. I feel like it's a bad idea, but also it could reunite us and we could be friends again? 
It's probably a bad idea and I probably won't do it though..
Please give me words of wisdom."
ff,"Too cowardice or just selfish?
So English is not my first language so there might be some grammar mistakes but this has been bugging me for a while now.
There was this girl I met some time during my last year of middle school and I guessed she took an interest in me, I was pretty confused as I wasn't the type to stand out much and I wouldn't talk at all unless someone comes up and starts a conversation with me. And she was the one to do that - uh, during a school graduation ceremony, of course. After that, we went to different high schools but still kept in touch.

So overtime, after the graduation, we kind of became close, as friends. Well I didn't have many friends to start with so I spent a lot of time talking to her about all kind of stuff and I was devoted, if she was sad I would spend my day trying to cheer her up or yes, I wouldn't push her to say what was on her mind if she didn't want to share but yeah, I could do anything to make her happy because as I said before, I didn't have many friends, I was bullied and she was the first one to be so kind to me - all my ""friends"" kind of just sided with the bullies when they knew I was the target. At one point, I thought I was in love with her. But that was the part I would feel guilty whether it came up, I thought because she was the popular type, and she had a boyfriend, dating her was something I could never do. But then she broke up with her boyfriend (it was some kind of argument over some disagreements iirc), I was happy about it but it just wasn't the right time, she was sad and she would spent the whole summer the following year after we met just talking with me about stuff and as we could do some drawings, we kind of made a world of our own and we would stay up until 2 in the morning everyday just to think of a concept for that universe (it's like making a comic or something, I'm a big nerd for world concepts) so it was like I was bonded with her. Anyways I think I'm being too informative about this so I'll just skip to the main point. After that, about 6 months or so I tried to be an understanding friend and I didn't take a single opportunity to try to flirt with her as I knew I would be a dick if I had done that - well because I thought I shouldn't pressure her into a relationship whereas she just got out of one.

So anyways, after a year, she got over it, I thought it was the right time for me but I didn't have the confidence to confess because I was overprotective of her as she didn't/doesn't have a good family and I was more like a big brother to her, because she was the one who wasn't good with dealing problems and I've lived my whole life dealing with all kinds of problems so I had a good view of dealing with them (I won't go into details as it would be another really long story) - So the idea of us dating was kind of ridiculous - I still don't know if she ever felt the same way. So I tried to change for the better, I went out to socialize more (it was exhausting but hey, there are things you would do for love), I worked out to lose weight so she doesn't feel embarrassed if we were to get together (she doesn't say it but I know she doesn't even want to date a fat guy) - I wanted to be a good partner for her, I know I wouldn't be the best but I could try. I tried to be someone reliable because I know full well she kind of looked down on me, how she tried to prove that she's better than me at everything (she is, at some fields). But the distressing part was that she started changing, she is still popular (yup, up until now), but she had more outbursts, she was constantly crying and whether I came up to ask her what was wrong she would throw a fit at me so I thought I was invading her privacy too much so I didn't say anything anymore, I was just there, trying to be supportive. So for the second time, I let go of another opportunity for a girlfriend.

(you can actually skip the first two parts but I just felt like going into details, sorry)

The third time, I thought it was time to make a move and she met a girl and fell in love with her instantly, I was supportive of her regardless. The latter one was also attracted to her so I thought just what kind of person would be so selfish to stop their bestfriend from getting in another relationship. I mean, honestly, I never had any luck with girls so I could just wait for later, her being happy was my priority. Yeah, so ever since I tried to change, I was better at talking. So I helped them get together, how to reply just to get the other one to be her girlfriend. And after that, our friendship was getting better. I thought I was the happiest person at the time, but another part of me was devastated. That part was well hidden for quite some time but it grew, it hated her girlfriend, it hated the fact that I was being too devoted and never got anything in return (I didn't quite expect anything in return from the start but I guess my feelings piled up). And before I knew it, I was being a control freak, I hated the other one not out of jealousy, but rather because she brought her down - her girlfriend was suicidal, she kept saying how she wanted to die - well I could careless about that because I knew lovers don't like bestfriends. That is, until she started saying how she wanted to die, she was constantly whining, crying and whether I asked her she just said nothing was wrong and kept on doing so. And whether I tried to talk some sense into her she just replied with a single ""Ok."" and it was bugging me. And she spent most of her time talking to her girlfriend and kinda just went anywhere with her, I never knew what was going on in her life anymore at this point. Now I'm not that small to start hating her for that, I let it slide anyways, though it bugged the hell out of me. So as you all know how important your last year of highschool is, she kind of just felt so down she lost a great deal of weight but it's kinda weird how I started to careless about details, about her too, of course, guessing because I was let down so many times. But anyways, my feelings for her started to fade, but regardless, I still tried to cheer her up, pushing her to study but she gave me the cold shoulders and even got mad at me for ""interfering"" with her life. And ever since we talked less. Then lately I don't know what is wrong with me but I just started feeling hatred for her. I didn't even blame myself for that. I just...Hated her. But for some reasons, I can't quite tell her and I don't even know why, why our distance grew and why I loved her and now I hate her.

Is it strange?"
ff,"My friends acting dumb and I don’t know what to do?
So I have a “friend”. Let’s call this “friend” B. I’ve known B for most of my school life (we didn’t talk from K to 5th grade bc different classes and moving away). In 6th grade she was the only friend I had in academic classes and we both formed a squad (spoiler: it didn’t last). Essentially we were very close and have a lot of inside jokes.

Starting last April, B started ignoring me after I told her I wanted to do an assignment sheet alone. She took it the wrong way and we ended up fighting the entire break. We made up quickly and life was normal again. Another long ass fight happened over the summer for unknown reason. Then in November, I saw B at Target with someone she hated (lets call her E) at the time (B still does). What pissed me off that B fucking cat-fished E the same week. Again, made up 2 weeks later.

She’s probably the only friend that actually asks to hang out with me (I have other friends btw). B likes to play these ditching pranks when I would leave then B and her other friends would leave me. She’s also destroyed my stuff after I told her no. One of my other friends (let’s call her A) told me that she was obsessed with me that every time when hanging out with B, B would mention me and it creeps me out. I don’t know how to deal with the friendship since I’m scared to deal with B. Any advice?

TLDR: My friend is toxic and obsessed with me. I don’t know how to break it off without hurting her feelings?"

My wife is pregnant with our second child and she didn’t want to keep it at first because raising one is tough but two sounds impossible.
With rent + daycare + my wife stop working for a year was going to be a squeeze.

I reassured her my dad is retired they have a live in house keeper/cook, 5 bedroom house. That we can move back in and help him with sone rent. My sister just gotten a job as a doctor and shes out. The house is empty aside from my half brother whos in high school.

My dad said yes of course but the following month my dad said my stepmom wasn’t feeling it. She want space and doesn’t really want to be around kids that often. My dad offered money but it was about help.

I thought it was a win win. My dad was complaining earlier how he was bored and he is working part time since ss and pension wasn’t enough. I was going to pay rent. And I thought grandparents like kids. I wasn’t expecting them to raise them. 

I can understand my stepmom side but i cant help but feel if my mom was still around this wouldn’t have been an issue. My dad doesn’t care but he has to look out for his wife.

My wife is stressed out and upset at me for acting like they would help us.

I been saving to buy a house for awhile i guess i will have to dig into those. And its a reality check for me your 33 years old and your parents cant always get your back. My father has helped me alot i am always thankful. But my stepmom and I always butting heads.

Little background, I have two ""sons"" (both Eurasians) one is just about to turn 18 and one has just started high school (13) He is into stuff I would consider for lack of a better word ""Beta"" his interests include puppets and Lego, I've tried to takes these things off him and force him to enjoy some more grown up things but my ""wife"" keeps giving them back. So I know he's going to struggle with women in high-school because he is super beta and will definitely put them off with his interests and his racial condition. So I'm asking if their are any fathers who have ""red-pilled"" their children about women and what the best process of introducing red-pill philosophy and sexual strategies to my beta ""son"" I am thinking he's the right age as now he is beginning to notice girls, I bought him some nudie mags and I know he's been checking them out if you know what I mean, so I definitely think the time is right to give him the red-pill!

ff,"I [22/m] and a friend of mine [20/m] had a dispute which questions our friendship.
TL;DR, 
OP misread the situation by telling a joke to which his drunk friend took offence and revealed to OP's other friends OPs 3-year buried drug habit. OPs friends now know things OP originally wanted to be left in the past. 
 

*********


My friend (let's call him T, for now) and I had a dispute over what we classify as exposing each other. T was very drunk and gave some information I kept very personal out to my other friends and myself who were sober at the time. He mentioned the last time I got high, but he did mention how long ago. This is important because Ive had an on and off history of depression which I've been struggling with years, and I previously I used to combat it by developing a drug habit. I've been working hard to be clean for 3 years, and I've kept all this under the rug because I didn't wish to be labelled by my friends as irresponsible, or be denied respect as their friend. I buried my past and drug habits for good,  doing so brought me great happiness because this was the first thing I felt I like I myself was worth something and it let me come out of depression for a long time. He did all this because I had made a joke in this particular conversation, to which he reacted negatively, and said I ruined his reputation though my joke was not intentional to do so. Because of this, people I trust  now are asking me if I do drugs or partake in self harm because of what he said about me. Some people I'm friends with are asking me if I need counselling though I'm clean. I'm not sure if I can forgive him and it's made me feel less than a person, which is something I haven't felt in 3 years. I feel worthless again and I'm not quite sure I can mend all my friendships that probably think down upon lowest point in life. Should I cut ties with T? What should I do if now my other friends  might not see me the same way anymore?"
ff,"My dad's mad after game night.
My family and I were playing board games two nights ago. We finished the first one which went well, it was fun. We switched to the second game that 4/6 of us had played before. After my brother finished explaining the rules my dad (who has played before) asked a  really stupid question, so we thought he was joking. He then got really mad while we were answering his question, got up, and said he's not playing anymore. The next day we didn't say anything to each other. Today, we still haven't said anything to each other and he's clearly mad.

ff,"Advice Please
I've been in a relationship with a woman for some time now, and it's becoming serious enough that marriage is a certainty. She has a son from her previous marriage, seven years old. Her previous husband, however, was very controlling and abusive. Her son has a lot of behaviour issues as a result. He constantly swears (""fuck, shit, cunt, etc"", just to show how extreme), he's violent a lot, throwing things across the room, he's constantly screaming and shouting, no concept of manners. He'll shout ""give me food now"". His mother, as a result of the cruel treatment she got from her husband, is too scared to stand up to him. He clearly has anger issues bordering on clinical. He'll often have breakdowns with fits of anger.

She lives with her parents. While they have the best of intentions for their grandson, her mothers treatment of her is vile. She's cruel and demeaning. She constantly undermines her confidence and authority, saying she's stupid and doesn't know what she's doing in front of her son, and then, stupidly, complains that she get her son to listen to her. She regularly swears. She loudly gossips about everybody, complaining about with violent undertones. And to make it worse, she often threatens calling social services on her. Personally, I doubt she would, as she got far more incriminating evidence against her than her daughter. But either way, he would be taken from both of them.

So, yeah..... a bit complicated. No idea what to do. As it's very likely that I'll become a step father to this child, I was wondering what advice people could give, or direct me to somewhere that could help. Thanks"

The server consists of text, media, and voice channels where users share their interests, pets, favourite videos, etc, and have discussions of all varieties. Most of the action happens in the voice channels however, where we have rooms for watching movies, listening to music, and playing video games in addition to large rooms for rowdy discussions and smaller rooms for more quiet conversations. Sometimes we’re all in a big room together, chilling out as we play video games, and other times we splinter off into separate rooms to partake in differing activities.

im Not sure if it is appropriate to end a friendship because I wasn’t invited to a wedding but everyone else in the group of friends were and I didn’t even know about it. She did not even bother telling me. This was a very special friend to me and I would tell her everything about me back in college and she was the most important person to me. I tried keeping in contact after she graduated by texting her at least once a month etc. but she would hardly ever respond. It seemed as if I was making much more of an effort than she was. When I found out that I wasn’t invited but everyone else in our group was, she hurt me in a way so deeply that she could never understand. She did tell me that I was on her list of people she wanted etc. when I found out, because she was that important to me, I couldn’t eat, sleep or study for my liscening boards for over a week. I lost seven pounds over one week, I called my psychologist a couple of times, cried endlessly. And it really hurt to know that maybe we weren’t as close as we once were. I am not sure if you can understand how I really felt. I’m not even sure if it’s appropriate to place it in a thread like this. I’m not sure if it was appropriate for me to end a friendship due to this situation?

And is it true that if person A does not invite person B to the wedding, and if person B got hurt by it, that person A has to accept the result of person B wants to end the friendship?"

So my boyfriend and I moved in with our friend and her bf. We all had this idea of living together, hanging out, have dinner get togethers with our other friends & board game nights etc.. it was all great and exciting but then at day 1 after the move, our friend and her bf just kept to themselves, in their room and hardly hangs out with us. Issues came up with them not helping out with the household chores and when my bf and I brought it up, they got defensive. Then our friend informed us that she is pregnant which changes the dynamics in the house even more as they now plan to get out of our shared lease early. That leaves us to figure out how to pay for the remaining months and look for a replacement. That’s fine, it’s their decision to have the baby. But then immediately after that announcement  my friend just literally stopped talking to us, she won’t leave her room, and she would have her bf bring food to her room. In a rare occasion that she comes home while we’re in the living room , she doesn’t say hi or talk to us. I am really confused and hurt because I feel like I’ve lost a friend that I used to know.

ff,"My bio dad died and his family didnt tell me until 3 days later...
Him and I were never very close. Probably an understatement considering our only interactions were him calling drunk and calling me dirty names since the age of 14. I believe it started at 14 because I had sent him a letter wanting to have a relationship with him. I just wanted to know my dad even if it wasn't a super close relationship I still wanted one. Well fast forward 6 years later he's in the hospital for nearly a month and no one tells me, not even his sister who I am in contact daily with. Finally he passes away last thursday. He was intubated and couldn't speak for most of his hospital stay. He was 39. I asked his side of the family why nobody told me he was in the hospital or why nobody told me died the day it happened. Their reasoning? I had vented at a few points saying I wished he was dead (normally after he would call me drunk and call me a whore and talk shit on my mother who raised me since birth). I am also not invited to the service. Should I feel duped? Should I feel cheated out of a chance to say goodbye even though we weren't on the best of terms? Because his family and girlfriend sure as hell made it clear i don't even deserve to grieve. All i wanted was a relationship with him and all I got was name calling and him taking me and my mom told court over the $200 he had to pay in child support each month. I wasn't very nice to him, I tried to be.. But he made it so hard. So was it  really they're call to say I couldn't see him. Or am I right to feel this way.."

ff,"How to drift away from a 'best friend' you don't like anymore?
I have a friend, and I am trying to put distance between us. They're generally a nice person (but do some mean things occasionally), but they're quite... boring. Okay, very boring. I don't even know how I have been able to put up with the lack of interesting conversation for the past 2 years. I need a best friend with whom I can laugh about fun stuff and not just talk about SCHOOL. 

Let's call them B. 

B has clung to me for the past 2 years, so they don't have any other friends. I have loads of other friends, but they all assume that I'm best friends with B, so they don't make an effort to include me in their friendship group. I've told quite a few of them, and they are giving me some advice on what to do, but I want to see what all of you say. 

For the past few weeks, I have been making it quite clear that I don't really want to talk to B. I give them short answers as replies, don't make eye contact or initiate conversations and I have generally been ignoring them. I know it sounds mean, but I've had enough. I can't deal with clingy people. However, B is either EXTREMELY OBLIVIOUS, or they are just being really stubborn. 

Also, even though I am ignoring B, I sit next to them in lots of lessons, and I also hang out in the same room as them at break and lunch so they always come and shuffle next to me! SO. INFURIATING. I don't want to change rooms, because then I won't be with my friends. 

Another thing is that if I ignore B, I actually look like a loner. I ignore them by being antisocial in the corner doing my homework most of the time. I mean, everyone in my school already thinks I'm sort of weird child that studies all of the time, because I always seem to be studying at school (which is actually because I don't do anything at home). I also have to eat by myself at lunch, and having social anxiety definitely doesn't help with that. I know I shouldn't care about that, but it's hard not to. 

I went off on a tangent there, didn't I?

So basically, what I'm trying to ask you is that should I completely completely ignore B (e.g. don't talk to them at all) or is that too mean? (Please don't suggest anything that says to try and be friends with them, because I don't want to do that. I want to make exciting friendships that I will remember, and not be stuck with... a boring person. Also, I'm 14. I don't know if that will help, but meh.)

B has turned into one of those people that... you just want to punch in the face for no reason. Do you sort of get what I mean?

OK so I had a bit of a blur of boundaries with my therapist. It wasn't a big deal. Therapy ended and we became kind of distant friends who still chat via phone calls and texting.

Nothing happened between me and my therapist and we never slept together, but things were a bit... Weird i guess. Some of the stuff my therapist said could make her lose her job.

Anyway I pranked my friend today by photoshopping a fake conversation between me and my college tutor. In the convo I told them my friend referred to him as ""daddy nick"" behind his back. It was merely a joke and I didn't really message the tutor any of this.

She freaked out when I sent her the photoshopped convo. And her immediate response was: ""I'm going to ruin your therapists life for this!"" I told her it was a joke and a prank. She demanded evidence which i gave her... She then acted as though things were fine when they weren't.

She said if I ever do anything like that again she'll ruin my therapists life. I feel as though she is basically at this point a bomb waiting to go off. She then asked me how my rabbit is doing??? Like I want to speak to her now???

ff,"Unsure how to talk to friend about something they're doing, or well, not doing. [Advice]
First time poster in need of a bit of advice. Sorry this'll be long.

So basically, I've been having a bit of an issue with a friend of mine, we've been friends for around 3 years at this point and everything was great! We'd talk every day and hang out around once a week/2 weeks depending on schedules and [my] kids schedules etc.  Then about 8(ish) months ago, she got a new boyfriend, and of course I'm really happy for her, she deserves all the happiness! 

Thing is though, over the last 5 months, there's been a steep decline in conversation between myself, said friend and another friend.  Friend #2 and I have been making ALL the effort to make plans with friend #1 and we're getting almost nothing back.  We'll text her and we'll not hear anything for days, but she's on Facebook or snapchat posting pictures of her and her new boyfriend, and when she does text back, it's a totally one sided conversation. Like I'll ask her maybe ""how have you been"" and I;ll get a page of text about how she has been with BF and what they've been doing and at the end it'll be ""okay, I got to go, bye!""
If I don't specifically ask her about her baby (who I adore, she's like my niece) I don't hear about her, at all. It's all about BF.

Recently, Friend #1 and I didn't see each other for just over 3 months! (did I mention she lives 20 minutes away from me?) No matter how many times I asked her over, offered to go to her house, offered to take her to coffee etc, either the invite went unacknowledged, or she wanted to spend the time with her BF. 
At that point, I was a bit annoyed but, I understood that people have lives and sometimes things just don't match up.
However, the reason I'm looking for advice is because, after not seeing her for 3 months and talking to her only a handful of times, she hits me up and asks if I can watch her baby so she can go out with another friend. (who wasn't even going, she took her BF) 
I said yes, as I know how it is to want to go out and not to have a babysitter, so my husband and I watched baby over night for her.
The ONLY thing I said to her was that I had plans the next day after 1 so I needed her to be back before then. (spoiler: she wasn't!) So I couldn't do my plans and asked friend #1 to stay and hangout since I hadn't seen her for so long. 
In the 1 hour(!) that she stayed, she called my sister (who I had plans with - we were meant to take my youngest out for his birthday, because friend hadn't come back yet, my sister took him out by herself) a freak!  She said 3 times ""imagine not waiting for you!"" 
I said to her, we'll it's because you weren't back and she blamed traffic for being 2 hours late...

On top of the main incident, there's been an incident where she brought a stranger to my house (after I told her I didn't like strangers in my house or around my children) and expected me to be okay with it!  She dropped the bomb of bringing this stranger to my house 15 minutes before they arrived and told them I didn't want them there so they felt awkward! (I did try really hard to make them feel welcome, and thankfully the kids had plans so they weren't put in the situation)

The advice I'm seeking is  - A. How do I talk to friend #1 about this without coming off as bitchy or upsetting her.  and B. Should I keep being friends with her?   I don't like to give up on a friendship, but I feel like she only wanted me around when she wanted something from me. 

Any advice is welcome, even if it's me being weird or whatever.
Thanks guys."

Hey all,

I made a post on this subreddit a couple days ago. I thought that all my friends disliked me because I am mean to them, but for a solid 2-3 days I was the nicest I had been to anyone for what I remember, I asked all my friends how their days were, bought them food, listened to them. And it worked, they all are my very good friends now, but there is just one problem, the person who I considered my BEST friend is being a dick. Once I get attached to someone it’s hard for me to let go. For example, in my previous relationship, I hated my gf, and I hated being with her, talking to her, I found her annoying, I never broke up with her, then, one day she decidedI was neglecting her so she said she wanted to break up, I begged her to stay even though I hated everything about her. We still end up breaking up, afterwards I was soo happy. Now, this person who I considered to be my BEST friend makes fun of me all the time for getting dumped by a girl and saying “you got left by an ugly girl for a gay guy.” This sentence aline can tell you about his personality and how bad of a person he is. Today, my scho went to a ski park, I enjoyed my day, had fun, everythkng was fine. On the bus ride back to school, I was talking to my so called “best friend.” He randomly went up to a girl I didn’t know and told her I liked her, she then said “I don’t care.” I don’t know if this was a rejection or just a simple “I don’t care” but I didn’t really care because I didn’t find her attractive at all. I laugh it off and end up saying the word “nigga.” Now, I am what you would call a mulatto. I am bi-racial, half black, half white. After I said this word, a girl sitting behind me called me a racist. I then say that i’m half black and she says “I know.” This was embarrassing, I get made fun of a lot because of the tone of my skin and my ethnicity, it’s one if the things that still get to me. Moving on, he proceeds to point at me and laugh, then, scream at me saying I got rejected by the girl I didn’t even like or ask out. I stood up on the bus and accidentally touched a girl’s tit, she got very mad and I apologized but you could tell she was still mad. We get to school and he starts pushing me into doors and lockers, he is much bigger than me and I couldn’t really push him back easily. The day ends then we take the bus back home, me and this kid are on the same bus and he says, “you’re gross, nobody likes you and you got rejected by the ugliest girl in school. That’s why you got dumped by an ugly bitch.” And he walked away, as i’m walking home, I was talking to some friends and they treat me like a fucking human, they were nice, didn’t insult me, and treated me nicely. I got home and here I an, what should I do, he has managed to get the whole school to believe I am a perv, racist, ugly, nobody. It’s actually funny, he was the first person to ever talk to me, he was nice to me but after a while it just turned out he was a bad person, I wish one of the other guys were first to approach me, i’d have much better friends. What do I do, it’s one one of the hardest things to dispel gossip, everybody thought I was gay when I first came to the school, I got a girlfriend, suspicion gone, but how am I gunna disprove im not racist, not a perv, and how the hell am I supposed to deal with this “friend” if mine?"
ff,"My sister wants to have an intervention with our parents about their marriage.
So my sister and I are both adults. I'm 29 and she is 26. Neither of us live at home anymore. I have my ~~only~~ own little nuclear family now and she is renovating a house with her long time boyfriend. Since we have been adults we have noticed that our parents marriage isn't exactly happy. Our parents are basically polar opposites. Dad is a really outgoing people person who likes to have lots of activities and friends. However, he is very very emotional and can blow up at the slightest hint of ""disrespect."" If something is wrong it is never his fault, you know the type. Mom is quiet and reserved, not much on physical or verbal affection at all. Her only hobby/activity is through music ministry at our church. My dad joined the church when they got married, but he isn't religious really and only comes on the holidays. Lately my sister has been really distressed by our parents relationship. She is very empathetic and it really upsets her when they fight. So much so, that she does not want to be around them anymore because of it. Today she told me that she thinks we should have some sort of intervention with them about their marriage. My sister and I have discussed before that they probably should really be divorced, but that it will never happen because our mom is Catholic. I think an ""intervention"" would just make it worse because I know my dad will see it as a personal attack. I'm of the ""it's none of my business"" persuasion but I don't want to miss out on family time with my parents and sister. We all get together every couple of weeks at my parents house for dinner and board games, which I love. I don't want to lose that. Any thoughts? Is there anyway to approach our parents without making it worse?"
ff,"Why is it that I forget information about certain people?

Today, I've asked one of my female coworkers about what degree is she going for even though I keep asking that question when I forgot. She told me she's going for a dental bachelor. I've brought up that I've brought this up a bunch of times and she nodded.  I felt pretty embarrassed for asking that question and forgetting the answer a lot of times. (She isn't the only one though)

I think the reason why I forget is because the front end has a tendency to have its employees to have erratic working schedules thus it doesn't help when some of the employees go to college on their days off.  I'm twenty five year old woman who doesn't go to college because I'm not too wild about school. 

I know a little bit about some of my coworkers, but I don't hang out with them outside the workplace because of many reasons. 

1.) I don't always to make the effort to build a relationship with them because I don't have a lot to say except for questions such how's your day, what time are you working til, and anything new.  I will speak when I'm spoken to.

2.) I'm usually inside my head thinking a lot. 

3.) I look for people with similar interests. (video games, animation, internet, vaporwave, and so forth on)

4.) I usually wait until someone talks to me.

5.) I don't open up to people easily.

6.) My social life is spent more online.

7.) The interests I have aren't mainstream (video games seem to be somewhat mainstream these days)

8.) I have autism while most of the employees don't have autism. 

9.) I don't drive due to my fear of disability limiting my ability to drive safety.

10.) I don't talk a lot about my interests because I'm afraid I may obsess over them over and over again due to the point it may annoy co workers.

11.) I don't usually get involved with conversations with co workers because I need to focus on my job.

12.) When the time gets busy, I normally don't talk a lot. Again, I need focus on the job. 

13.) I come from a solitary family from my mother's side. (introversion)

14.) I have a fear that I may say something that may offend them.

15.) I don't always have the motivation to socialize.

16.) I don't talk about my social life with family for reasons.

17.) I come across as serious, thus it doesn't help that I take a lot of things seriously


I'm currently looking for free volunteer drivers in my area so I could get to places and make and keep friends.  Thankfully, I have someone at home to take me to work, but not always available to take me. Thus I can get to work by walking. (My town is somewhat walk-able)

Back to retaining some information about co workers, I remember them I like some of the facts about them. I will put the first letter of my names of the co workers for privacy.

Example: B is  big on cats, she has an eighteen year old daughter who used to have a pet bunny long time ago. 
She also love chinese as much as I do. 

C loves to play video games just like I do.  He doesn't like the customer is always right policy.


I have a fifteen minute break for every five hours I work. The breakroom tends to vary with there's no people to there's lots of people.

Some of the co workers I know use their phone to browse on the internet while eating, and I don't want to bother them while they browse on their phone. Let's face it, it's getting tougher to socialize in real life when internet's taking over everyday life. 

TL;DR I'd like to know why I lose track of facts of particular co workers and what could I do about it."
ff,"Friends keep making fun of me?
Firstly, I'm 18 and attending high school right now.Recently, my parents got us a dog, and we named it Carly. I freaking loved her, but after reviewing some medical expenses we would have to pay, we had to give her back to her shelter after only a month or so of having her. I was heartbroken.

I came back to school on Monday this week and told my friends. Now in my friend group of three, there is one guy who loves to make fun of us. One of my friends is fat so he makes fun of his weight. I'm gay and he makes fun of me for being a faggot. My other friend does weed and he makes fun of him for being a drug junkie.

But I think he crossed the line this time. He made fun of me by saying ""you killed your dog"" and all he's been doing this week has been calling me a ""dog killer"" and telling everyone that I am one. The annoying part is my best friend in the group is tagging along with this joke and they both think it's okay to make fun of me for this.

I'm kind of embarrassed to say this, but I'm a very emotional person and I suffer from depression so it's hard for me to deal with this kind of stuff. Today when they started making fun of me again for being a ""dog killer"" I left and hid in the bathroom cause I just wanted to cry and I did. I hate it when people are mean to each other and it really hurts when someone does it to me. That, and the fact I was really sad about Carly leaving me makes me just not want to talk to them anymore. But the problem is those guys are the only friends I really have (Trust me, they remind me I'd have no friends if they weren't so nice to be my friend).

I really don't know what to do. I miss my dog, I've been really depressed as of recently, and my friends are making fun of me. What should I do about my friends, honestly? Because I know if I tell them ""guys stop making fun of me, I didn't kill my dog"" they'd without a doubt say something like ""that's exactly what a dog killer would say!"". I've never been able to reason with them whenever they make fun of me.

Can anyone help me?"
ff,"Something my dad said has been bothering me
So a while back I decided to make some french onion soup for the first time. I don't cook very often and I'm not that good at it, so when I made the soup it seemed to turn out pretty good. I was kinda proud of my attempt and wanted my dad to try it to see what he thought of it. I brought him a small bowl to try it, and I know he was joking but it really hurt my feelings. He says to me as I hand the bowl to him, ""It's not poison is it?"" What do you guys think? Do you think it was just harmless joking? Or do you think he thinks I would actually do something horrible like that?"

Hello!

I recently launched a YouTube channel with fun videos for children and I'd like some feedback on the content, and I thought it would be a good idea to get feedback from parents or big sisters/brothers, etc. And if you also have suggestions as to what kind of content would be fun and educational for children I'd love to hear them. 

I am writing these songs so I basically decide what the story and the animation will be about.

ff,"Possessive friends
Hi there, this is my first post.
I became friends with a girl from my new class this year (who i had never met until we came into the same class) and became good friends with each other.She has a big network of friends and is quite different from me(talks to everyone, likes everyone, an extrovert). One day, a boy who happens to be her best friend saw us talking and got angry(for the life of me, i do not know why) and started making fake rumors about me, which she blindly believed. when she came to confront me about these false allegations, i flipped out and got quite angry and i have not talked to her for 3 days.
Her friends are determined to hate me for some unknown reason and at the same time the girl has to problem with this, even defending them, saying that they are just very possessive of her.
I am in a dilemma on what to do, ignore the hate or to stop caring and ignore her."
ff,"Found out my oldest brother and his wife encouraged my little sister to sleep with a married man nearly 40 years her senior because it would help her learn to appreciate her body and get over past bad experiences.

ff,"Went through tough times, friends weren't there, but I still want them in my life.
I have 2 best friends from high school since we were young.
Long story short, we were the best of friends, had a great friendship and were really good to each other.
We are all 19 now, and I went through a bad time the end of last year, my brother was shot in the shoulder as a accident at work, and had alot of issues with my childhood come up.
The only difference with my friends and I is that I grew up in a completely different way then they did , I was raised in foster care, that was tough, I grew up poor and had many bad things happen during that time, on the other hand they had very loving parents and a great home.
 They dont seem to understand some of those things and find it hard to understand why I am the way I am sometimes I need my space and need to be by myself, Being in a foster care that had terrible people in it, I never had celebrated birthdays since a young age, like 3 and when i was 15 was when I found out that they are special days , and so when birthdays do happen I may come across as blunt? Or dont make a massive deal out of it for them sometimes, and they take all of that as I am being blunt and they seem to move away from me and dont make plans with me, same as when my brother was shot, I was a mess, initially they were there for me but eventually they drifted off. 

But as always we came back together and were just like old times, 
I know and they know Im a person who likes to deal with things on my own, but I just feel like a burden in their perfect world. 

I feel like their parents dont like me because of my family history and the way I grew up, I just dont want to always feel like a burden on my friends."
ff,"How to Make Friends When No One Likes You
A little background, in 4th grade my teacher would encourage bullying me (she got fired the end of the year) and I pretty much grew up taught it was okay to be bullied, so I never learned to stand for myself. That obviously left a lot of scars, and my depression (diagnosed in 7th grade) makes me isolate myself a lot. 

I don't want to sound like I'm looking for sympathy, and sorry if I am. 

But now I have mere months left in the school year of my senior year and I still have absolutely no friends. I am friendly and I try to be as outgoing as I can, it feels like everyone is keeping me at an arm's distance though. 

Is it me? It must be, I don't know why but something about me just makes others hate me. I'll ask how someone's day is going and often the reply is just a short ""pretty good"" and then that's it. I refuse to beg for friendship or to force anyone to talk to me so when they walk away or leave I'll just accept it, wave and say ""see ya around"" or etc. 

How do I get people to be my friend though? I don't smell, I am ugly but I try to cover that up best I can with makeup. I just want to feel like I belong somewhere with someone."

I confronted her about it and she said she didn't mean so I forgave her. About 4 months ago I got a boyfriend and she started flirting with him and he didn't even care, he flirted back at her. and I went home crying and I decided to break up with the guy and stopped being friends with her for good because I realized that she was flirting with that guy I liked.

In about April my best friend cut me off from her life, we were friends for nearly 7 months and we were so close, had a really strong bond, and the only time we wouldn't talk to eachother whether it'd be facetime, messenger or call as well as trying to see eachother as often as possible, was when we would sleep. Otherwise, we were always talking to eachother and we cared for and loved eachother a great deal and did heaps for eachother but yeh she did in fact cut me off because I didn't reply to her messages one day. Anyway we haven't communicated at all since then but I sent her a letter for this year 12 camp we did so it's a graduation letter dedicated to her. I told her I would send it to her when we were friends and I'm not sure if she's forgotten but it is going to be sent to her. The contents of it go along the lines of thanking her, stating how much I appreciate her and that I'll always be there for her no matter the situation in 1 1/2 pages. I'm not 100% but could this possibly bring me and her back to being friends again?"
ff,"Obesity Is Killing Our Friendship
Context - I'm 21 F, my friend is 24 F.  Both students living alone.

Obesity related health issues don't just run in her family - they've killed almost half her relatives. Six years ago, she ate fine, sure she was ""curvy"" but that was her build, her nature. She went on walks with her friends. Now she can barely make it to her front door. Her cousin - in his teens - died recently from heart failure. Weight related.

Yet, she continues to put on weight, eat awful food - like taking home meat double burgers from mc donalds and then re-frying them at home, for breakfast, plus sweets, every day - and also taking energy drinks all day followed by sleeping pills at night. That is, physically, killing her according to her doctors, but there's where our issues as friends start.

What's killing out friendship is her desperation - but absolute lack of effort - when it comes to loosing weight. She talks about switching back to eating the things that, when we first met, she loved - banana breakfast smoothies and chicken schnitzel. She even did a Go Fund Me for a stomach reduction surgery. Has seen more nutritionists than I knew existed. Yet whatever happens, she only eats more, or worse. She was told to stop eating pringles, and replace them with a healthy alternative like corn wafers but instead, she swapped them for deep fried pork buns. And so on.

Friends have always offered to help, to buddy up, to go with. I've been on diets she ditched the first day. I've been to the gym only to have her ""go bathroom"" out the front door. Everyone else gave up.

It doesn't help that her family, Fijian-Indians, seem to see food as the only way to show love. The early years, when she actually tried to diet, they'd constantly bring her fatty treats because they thought she looked too skinny. And of course, she'd eat them. And they'd bring more.

I have seen her go through almost four years of pretending she'll try. I've gotten so excited and so happy and so hopeful only to have it thrown in my face. I love her, but in all honesty, I don't want to keep waiting and watching for her to die. Because that's what the diagnosis has been for the past 6 months - change her life, or die from complications. But all she does is whine about being fat, and then ask me to order in pizza. 

What would you do?  I don't want to continue to watch her kill herself, but I can't think of anything I can possibly do to help her change."

I’m just in my room thinking about how hurt I am. Especially considering I’ve been doing all my moms chores for her. Pretty much doing everything she should do.  The only person who came to my defense was my dad. 

I told him I’m going to move out and he told me he wants me to stay. I think what really hurts is it feels like my whole family is against me. After hearing what they said, I kind of hate them. I think I need to get away from this situation. But I have literally have no one else."

ff,I Made My Best Friends Pens All From the Same Branch
ff,"I feel like the friendship I have is fake on her behalf
I have known this girl for going on 7 years. I am not the type of person that has many friends, or is very sociable. I try to keep to myself and mind my own business, and don’t care to hag out with people. We met at work, and I liked that there was so much that we had in common, almost like I could see myself in her. We became friends. However, there has been a few instances that make me question her friendship. 
We are both waitresses, and she would ask me how my night was and how much I made. It made me feel a bit uncomfortable, because the way she asked seemed a bit odd. If I would make more than her she would seem a little upset, if she made more, she seemed to be happy. Even now when I make more than her she says “I hate you”. She says I’m her “best friend” and gets mad if I hang out with someone else without her knowing, tag/get tagged by other people on FB, or go places without inviting her. Although, she does all of these things as well, but I don’t get upset or mention them.
When we started working at a different restaurant, right off the bat, there were people that didn’t like me. These are people that are problematic, and always cause drama (which I cannot tolerate). Well, my friend knowing that these people talked behind my back, hated me, and made up rumors about me, decided to invite on them to her house! At that moment I realized that this fakeness was not just in my mind! My friend likes a lot of attention, she gets upset when she doesn’t get it, or when I do; my friend likes to judge other people’s body’s (she’s taller 5’6”, thin); my friend sees every imperfection in others; My friend expects me to invite her out, buy her treats, bring her things to work, but she has never offered to do the same for me (although she does it for others); my friend posted 5 emojis on my fb wall on my birthday (😘🎉 🎂👭💃) I  always congratulate her and wish her well; My friend calls me her “bestie”..... how real is this friendship for her?? 
 I forgot to mention that I always try to give her Christmas/birthday presents according to what she likes(mostly earrings or pretty blouses/dresses), she rarely gives me gifts (which is fine, I don’t expect anything in return) but when she does, it’s something that has nothing to do with me (like a size large red and blue Superman-logo hoodie. I’m a size small) or a random item she finds in the clearance section..."

ff,"Help with/what to do about toxic sister?
(Sorry for sloppy wall and if this isn't the right thread) As the title says I don't know what to do about my 29 year old sister. She is known by the family to be immature, selfish, and impulsive. She repeatedly burns bridges with family when she does not get her way and will give them the short end of a deal if it benefits her (ie. Not paying my financially struggling mother back on the multiple occasions of covering her rent or car payment because she decided to use her paycheck on a new TV or $200 purse). I'd love to not speak to her and never go to her place but because she is the mother of my 2 year old niece this is not possible. To give you some perspective, she has fights with my niece's father who got their old apartment raided by the police for selling heroin (finding heroin and a pistol in a safe in the apartment) to the point of yelling and hitting, even late at night when the child should be asleep, right in front of my niece. Because her father is soon going on trial and to prison for a long time (ex convict in possession of a firearm on top of selling heroin) and as previously stated, my sister being a half-assed parent, I am left to clean up after her when it comes to my niece. I have to be consistent in teaching her not to hit people and not to spit at them. Again, to give you some perspective, I am 15 years old and do not need the stress of making sure a child grows up to be a decent person on my plate. My sister has multiple DUI and assault charges which have resulted in her drivers license being revoked yet she continues to drive with my niece in the car even when everyone who knows her and cares about the child tells her not to. Although she is better now she is still a complete ass of a parent with her first kid dying before the age of one and losing custody of her two other sons about 9 years ago (older one being 13 and the other being 9). I am actually convinced her uterus is hexed because every time she has a kid shit goes horribly south which makes me terrified in the case of my niece. In the winter of 2016 my sister attempted suicide (my niece being just under 1) and while her drug dealer boyfriend screamed at her while she laid on the floor saying she wanted to die I had to make sure the child was still sleeping through all of it in the next room. Now although few and far apart, I've had my struggles with depression so I understand how difficult postpartum depression can be but even then I believe as a parent you always put the child first in every scenario. On top of everything else she completely spoils my niece buying her an unnecessary amount of toys and candy whenever she reaches for it at the store and I know she is not going to be able to handle it when my niece wants something at the mall my sister absolutely cannot afford at the moment and her entire worldview changes when she realizes she does not get everything she wants when she wants it. Although I mostly enjoy being alone and I have never been in a relationship I can only imagine possible significant others would not be totally understanding when I try to explain that my niece comes first which only adds to the stress and worry. To be clear, my sister is not neglectful and provides for my niece with everything a child needs such as diapers, food, bed, cleaning, etc. but if she continues this way (which I know she will) my niece will grow up with the same characteristics as my sister and it's just about all up to me to make sure that doesn't happen. Can someone please, PLEASE help me?"

ff,"How To Get Over The Pain
I ended/lost a friendship with a best friend of 14 years. She was really good to me, once upon a time; I was declared disabled and lost my house and she let me move in with her and her husband to get back on my feet. For all she knew I could've been the Thing That Never Leaves. But I lived with her for about 9 months, got a job, and got my own place.

She's Mormon, and during this time had her first kid. She insists everything's fine, no worries (because she had to, I think; Mormons put a lot of pressure on their women.) But things start getting distant between us, and this is only something I notice in hindsight.

I got the greenlight to publish a book, and she offered to typeset because she had InDesign. Okay, are you sure? Yes. You're sure? Yes. Okay, cool, thanks, that's awesome, I don't have to do it myself cause I don't have the program or know how to use it. I give her a deadline for October and pay her.

Well, I bust my ass on this book for months. It's the most important thing I've ever done with my life and it means everything to me. And 4 days before deadline, I find out she's only done up to Chapter 5 on the book. Which basically means she fucked off for 4 months, and did nothing, which means she's going to do a rush job. That automatically means more mistakes that I have to depend on her to fix, which she didn't in the first place, and she's totally shattered my trust.

I freaked the fuck out on her and had a hysterical meltdown. It was bad, and I don't make any excuses for it. I was really shitty to her. I panicked and thought she was going to hold the book hostage with procrastination, and I had no way to get the files from her. I'd put myself up shit creek, because it was too late for me to learn InDesign.

Well, she was defensive, to say the least. She said I don't need to police her time, and I should've known this is how she works. I felt like she was trying to gaslight me, so I posted on Facebook about the situation without naming names and asked other professional artist friends if this was appropriately professional behavior. They said no. That REALLY pissed her off, because a few days later I got a letter.

In it she said she'd done all this stuff for me (let you live in my house, put up with your shit etc.), said I didn't want her to have her dream family and dream life (she was doing horse archery competitions and I didn't want her to do that, either, apaprently), my shitty upbringing made me dysfunctional, and she gave me an ultimatum that I had to make a change. Until then she said she didn't want me to talk to her, and she was ""closing her door to me.""

I felt supremely judged, i.e. ""My perfect Mormon family was NEVER dysfunctional, so obviously you're the problem here, as a dysfunctional person yourself. Not me."" I felt like I'd been un-forgiven, ""Hey, remember all that stuff I said I forgave you for? Surprise!"" And I felt horrible, like I could never apologize enough, and that from here on out I was going to be scapegoated because I was the fucked up one and she was the squeaky-clean Mormon.

I left her alone for about 6 week, not talking to her like she said. Then I reached out, apologized, and asked if we could talk in person without anymore nastygram letters. And this, to be honest, is where I'm most mad at myself, because I wish I'd just cut things off the minute she started talking like her shit didn't stink. Instead, we met, and she said my apology made her angry because it sounded like I'd disregarded her letter. I was a bit taken aback, because the letter sounded like one of those venting things where you're supposed to write them but not send them, and instead she was acting like she'd sent me gospel I needed to abide by.

I said I felt like I was always going to be the wrong one, no matter what. She said I came from a dysfunctional family, compared me to a fear-agressive dog, and said ""Which problem is more in need of fixing?"" So in other words, yeah. Yeah, I was always going to be wrong, because no matter what she did I was always going to be worse because of my background. She said I'd declared her typesetting ""a failure"" before I even saw it, and insisted she'd done a good job. I told her there were obvious mistakes, like misaligned tabs and words running into illustrations, and she said she'd made the deadline and reiterated that once again, I should have known she procrastinates. I told for someone who had gone to church for twenty plus fucking years, she didn't know how forgiveness works because Jesus doesn't say ""Forgive thine enemies, until you've got a whole pile of ammunition and can really use that shit against them."" (I'm agnostic.) She said she'd already apologized (implication being that I couldn't forgive) and when I told her it felt like she could never make a mistake, she screamed ""YOU JUST WANT ME TO GROVEL!"" and stormed off. Her husband came out, yelled at me, and told me to ""handle my shit"" and called me a toddler. Previously he'd admitted to me in private that he wouldn't hire his own wife for a job because of her lack of professionalism.

The next day I wrote her saying I needed my book files, to make sure the publisher could make corrections. And once that was good to go, I told her I was glad we weren't friends anymore, because all her judgement was off my shoulders. She said she would have fixed the typesetting mistakes if I'd just told her, DURING the time she'd explicitly said not to talk to her, so it was my fault again for not getting things corrected. I was arrogant, you see, and she said she wasn't angry, just that she felt sorry for me, and told me ""You are your family.""

I am genuinely glad to not be friends with her anymore. She made the worst of assumptions about me, turned on me when SHE fucked up and made it MY fault, and got hyper-defensive and toxic  in her behavior while simultaneously calling me dysfunctional. Hindsight is 20/20, and I feel like she had too much to do with her baby, couldn't say no, and resented the task in the first place. She said she didn't come home every night and think ""I'm not going to work on typesetting tonight, just to piss off Plethora"" as if good intentions can't pave the road to hell and hurt people. I said we were shitty to each other, but she won't admit fault at all. And I know I don't need a judgemental perfectionist in my life.

But I'm still hurt, and outraged, and angry. I keep finding myself having arguments in my head when I'm driving or trying to fall asleep. I'm furious that everything became conditional suddenly, that I was retroactively unforgiven, and treated in the worst way by someone who sees themselves as morally superior. Winter is just finishing up so I haven't really been able to get out fo ra Meetup or something, but it's hard not to fee like you can't make a relationship work when a 14 year one just went down the drain because of something you did. I've read some other Reddits, where people have lost friendships over things like weddings, which make me feel a bit better. Bitching someone out because they dropped the ball on your creative work suddenly doesn't seem so unreasonable. But I'm mad I tried to make things work even after a bunch of red flags telling me I should've known better, and STILL ended up feeling like shit because I ""apologized wrong"" and ""wasn't good enough."" I miss who my friend used to be, not who she is now. I feel like the only thing that's going to take away the pain is time, but it's been months and I still feel the same way, and feel like I'm justified in never trusting anyone again, because if 14 fucking years aren't enough, what is? How do you get over the pain of things ending so badly when part of it was your responsibility, too?"

ff,"Is this my fault?
I've been on SSI ever since high school but before high school I wasn't. My oldest aunt suggest to me to get SSI but let's call her Cancer Rat because her zodiac sign is a Cancer. I was like ""Nah, I'm good for now"" because I'm lazy I didn't feel like doing that but I didn't tell my aunt that! SO, she took it the wrong way and start yelling BLAH, BLAH THIS and BLAH, BLAH THAT. My mom was like ""Cancer Rat you cannot get mad because she decided not to do that!"" Cancer Rat gotten more mad ""I'm not mad, I was just saying."" I gotten tired of her yelling because she can't get her way. I was like ""Mom, let's just do it so Cancer Rat can shut the FUUUUUCK UP!""  

My mom was like ""Ok, let's just do it. Let's get it over with."" The thing is ever since then I was in 3rd or 4th grade the relationship between Cancer Rat and I went down hill! I stopped going to church with is where is start going down hill. She got mad because I stopped going to church with her. From time to time Cancer Rat will bring it up to manipulate me to have me feel guilty about it but I caught on to it. She makes fun of my weight, hair, clothes I wear, what I eat and drink, just everything like she's overdramatic about every fucking thing I do but I'm probably ain't the only one though. It's so bad that I can't even read a story on the Wattpad without her bitch ass accusing me of texting a boy when I wasn't! She probably hates when I play video games. In 2016 she called me mentally retarded and said I don't think straight but I don't know why and if I ask her why she said that to me that she'll just lie, lie, lie of why she said it. She gets overdramatic when she's the last to find out shit or when you stop telling her shit, stop talking to her. I stop telling shit because you'll tell her not to say anything to anyone that she'll do it anyways. She did all of this ever since I was in 3rd or 4th grade and still is til this day..  


Now you know my back story with Cancer Rat. 

Ever since 2014 I started to use Bitcoins and the only person knows I use it is my mom at the time but my brother started to find out and he ended up founding out. From 2014 to 2017 I will lose Bitcoins and wins or earn Bitcoins! Just like if I were to use the trade market, you'll win or lose some. In 2018 I wanted to make history by making thousands of dollars from a $29.00 Bitcoin investment and I did. The problem is that Cancer Rat daughter, let's call her Tuna Fish in her 30's. So I made 2 mil but the household only knew about it. Until I made a big mistake by making a youtube video about my 2 mil and shared the video to my Facebook! The mistake was sharing it to my Facebook page. Here's the thing…Tuna Fish love to lurk on people Facebook pages using her husbands account and I wasnt paying attention until after my aunt Cancer Rat confronted me about my earnings 3 days after I shared the link to my Facebook. 

Cancer Rat yell and cussed at me that accused me of using SSI money to earn my 2 mil, that I did it behind everyone's back, that I didn't even bother to let her help, that I was being greedy, I didn't even bother to tell her, that she had heard it through someone else how they showed her proof, that the person had showed her a video of it, she's disappointed in me, she will forgive but won't forget, and that she feels lefted out. Here's the thing I did use SSI to get the 2 mil because back in 2015 and 2016 that Cancer Rat b•tch ass sent a letter to them told a false story how I barely go places, that my mom have to do all the work, that I'm mentally retarded, that I rage on video games, other sh•t that I can't remember and one of the update application for SSI that Cancer Rat lied to them and said that I was in a wheel chair when I never was. 

So that's when I started to think that she might trying to get them to cut me off and thats why I used $29.00 of my SSI money to get the 2 mil as back up like I didn't think it was a big deal. It wasn't my fault to me because I wasn't the one sending letters trying to get someone cut off but my mom told me to not say anything about the letters when we had first found out and today is day to confront Cancer Rat. I had to do it. Now Cancer Rat wants to try and tell me what to do. She says ""Girl, whatever I say to you is for the best. Whatever you did to make that 2 mil that I want you to stop doing it because it's not fair that you made your first 1 mil before your 21st birthday. You didn't do anything specially to get it. I mean like you SAT ON YOUR ASS!"" She was pissed but I don't give a fuck.

I said ""I had to do what I gotta do! It's not my fault that it happen. The reason why I turn $29 to 2 mil is because some bitch trying to sabotage my SSI by sending in false letters and I wonder who? Now you're mad because I made 2 mil before my 21st birthday OMG!"" so Cancer Rat yell and cussed at me that she said ""I KNOW YOU USED YOUR FUUUUUCKING SSI MONEY TO EARN THAT 2 MIIIIIILLLLLLLLL AND YOU USED 29 FUUUUUCKING DOLLLLLLARS! YOU DID IT BEHIND EVERYONE'S BAAAAAACK! YOU DIDN'T EVEN FUUUUUCKING BOTHER TO LET ME HELP YOUUUUUUU! YOU WAS BEING GREEEEDY! YOU DIDN'T EVEN FUUUUUCKING TO TELL MEEEEEEEE! I HAD TO HEAR IT THROUGH SOMEONE ELLLLLLLSE! THEY SHOWED ME PROOOOOOF! THEY SHOULD ME A VIDEO OF IIIIIIIIIIIT! I FEEL SO FUUUUUCKING LEFT OUUUUUUUUT! I'M SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU GIIIIIIIIIIIIRL! I'LL FORGIVE BUT I WON'T FUUUUUCKING FORGET THIS."" After Cancer Rat stopped yelling that I was about to say something but my mom beat me to the punch. 

My mom said ""Cancer Rat, how is my daughter greeeeedy when you're the only one complaining about the money like she didn't even do anything wrong at all?"" Cancer Rat got so fucking fed up that she stopped her ass out our fucking house and slam our f•cking door but while Cancer Rat and her daughter Tuna Fish was leaving that they shook their fucking heads at me!! 

Another thing before I started to use Bitcoins that this household was very poor. Trying to make ends meet. Barely trying to keep the food in the house. What made it worse when Cancer Rat and Cancer Rat daughter Tuna Fish (Cancer Rat have 2 other sons but they always in the streets doing who knows what), Cancer Rat grandkids Mices always bragging about money, money, MONEY everytime they come over to our house. ""Look we went and bought this"", ""We went and bought that."", ""We went and spent this much money."", ""We went and spent that much money."" They knew we was poor. So I asked them ""Why everytime y'all come over here that y'all somehow brag about money?"" They was like ""GIIIIIIIRL ain't nobody trying to brag about money. Are you mad that you cant buy video games all the time LMFAO!!""  Always make fun of me about that.


June 3rd, 2018 I will be 21 years old. 

Here's my question about the 2 mil and everything that ➡Is this my fault? Am I in the wrong here because I used $29 of my SSI money to earn my 2 mil, that I did it behind everyone's back apparently, that I didn't even bother to let her help me apparently, that I was being greedy apparently, I didn't even bother to tell her apparently?"

Well come to my surprise, she just chose to stop watching. Like just like that. My mom says to not be friends with her because I don't need that kind of negativity in my life but we've been best friends for 8 years. I'm really stuck between a rock and a hard spot. I loved what we had for greys but it's just not the same anymore. How should I proceed. Need advice"
ff,"Friend is acting distant, not hanging out much, i don't know what to do.
*Apologies ahead of time for the novel.*

So i (M 30s) have been friends with my buddy (M 30s) for several years, and there seems to be a repeating pattern with him and i really don't know what to do when this happens.  Instead of a long history, i'll just cite these last few months as an example.

So as i said, we've known each other for quite a while.  He's probably my best friend, although i wouldn't say i'm his (i'm not sure he really has one).  But anyways, prior to the last couple months we were hanging out as we usually do.  If we don't hang out every other day, we'd usually catch up over voice chat while playing video games, etc...  And this is the normal routine for us, we'd talk or hang out at least every other day, if not more often.  Then suddenly, a few weeks ago, it's like a switch went off and he's out.

What i mean by that is since then, i may hear from him once a week for an hour or so, at best; sometimes longer.  When we do chat, he mostly seems normal, but i can tell he's off.  So i've asked him what he's been up to, what's going on in his life, you know the usuals, and i get the usual answers for him: work, playing video games, seeing his parents occasionally.  I've brought up his absence and asked him what's going on, and his answer is usually the standard runaround, ""oh nothing"", ""i've just been avoiding everyone"", ""just doing my own thing"".  I pressed a little harder a couple weeks back and got a jokingly put ""i guess i've got a serotonin imbalance, haha"". I could sense his desire not to talk about it (which he never does, he hates discussing anything feelings related), so i let it go.

Next time we spoke, i brought it up again, asked him how he was doing with his issues, and got the usual ""meh"" or ""i dunno"".  When i asked what i could do to help him, he answered, ""you can stop fucking asking me about it"", so i of course let it go, and our convo continued as if there were no problems.  But of course there are, he's still MIA for weeks at a time.  The thing is, this is a pattern with him.  We're normal buddies, seeing/chatting all the time for months, and then WHAM, he's out and like this for weeks or a few months.  Then as if another switch goes off, he's back on again and acts normal and as if nothing's happened.  This has happened more times than i can count.

You know i wouldn't be so concerned if he were actually busy with life and doing things, but as he tells it in his own words when i do see him, he's doing nothing out of the ordinary (which for him is work and sitting home every night by himself (lives alone) playing video games (something we usually do together).  But as far as i can tell he's just sitting alone by himself every night.  

I've considered the possibility he's depressed or bi-polar (although you'd never get him to admit that), in which case i don't know what to do if he won't talk to me about it.  I've considered that perhaps i've done something to make him angry, but when he does come around (if i'm not bringing up this issue), he acts completely normal and we laugh and cut up, and whatnot like nothings wrong.  I've thought perhaps he's just not interested in being friends anymore, but he does still come around, and as i've said, after one of these episodes for a few weeks/months it's as if nothing's happened at all.  

So my problem is this.  I don't know what to do when he's like this.  I don't know how to act, what to say, how to approach him, etc.  You know, he's my best friend, i'd like to be there for him, to help if i can, but he rebuffs any attempt on my part to find out what's really going on, well besides him just ""avoiding everyone right now, and doing my own thing"".  He gets agitated if i push the issue.  So how do i handle this?  Is there a way to broach this topic that would get a better response?  When he does come around, how should i act around him?  What do i say, should i even bring it up?  I'm a very open person regarding my feelings and inner workings, and he's obviously not.  If this is just a thing he does, if it's not my fault and there's genuinely nothing i can do to help, how would i even get him to tell me that's the case if he doesn't like talking about it?  When he gets this way i just feel like i'm walking on eggshells around my best friend.  I dunno if it's ok to text, to invite him around, or whatever cause i'm afraid it's gonna bother him and push him further away.

So i'm sure i've left out a lot of details, but i guess that's the gist of it.  I would appreciate any meaningful advice anyone has to offer, especially if anyone around here has experienced anything similar with a friend.  Thanks to everyone ahead of time for replying."

ff,"[Need Advice] best friend (21f) moving in with my dad (dad age) and I (21f)
My best friend and I have talked about living together plenty of times. Now it’s really happening because her family is moving out of state and she has nowhere to go. My dad and I live in an apartment together and share expenses (though he pays for most of it). It’s a pretty good situation, but there are anxieties we both have about my friend moving in.
She is unemployed and has been for a while. The deal was that she could move in once she got a job (the deal was made like 7 months ago), but she is still jobless and her family is leaving in 3 days. We’re letting her move in, and luckily her mom is willing to help out with her expenses until she gets a job. But here are the worries:
• She had a lot of time before this to get a job, what if she takes even more time even after she’s moved in? My dad and I know from experience how difficult getting a job can be, but also expected her to have one by now.
The thing is, she’s very picky (even when she can’t afford to be). She won’t just take any job, she’s only applying to places she’d prefer to work at. Which I totally get! But at some point you just gotta do something even if you hate it, it won’t last forever and will even help you get to doing something you don’t hate. She’s repeatedly said that she’s “not the kind of person that can work a job she doesn’t like”. And that is definitely making it take longer for her to find work. But what can ya do?
• Another thing is, my dad and I (my dad especially) have had not-so-great experiences with friends/acquaintances moving in. That’s definitely made both of us have some not-so-great feelings about this situation (even if it may end up being really good!). A lot of things can ruin this and it’s hard to know how to avoid those things while still being a friend. It’s a thin thin line.
• my dad and I (my dad more than me) are also worried about compatibility. My dad and I get along great and it’s been no problem for us to live together. We have an unspoken agreement on bills, chores, privacy, etc. It just works. How can we keep that agreement while including a whole new person who might not think the same way?
For instance, I don’t know much about the way she lives. I know how it’s been with her family, but things are different when you leave home. It’s tough to say how it will be, but my dad is worried that she won’t be the kind of clean, kind, generous person he expects a friend/roomie to be. It’s tough because I agree with him..
• there’s the other matter of an official Roommate Agreement that could be made and signed by the 3 of us. We all think it’s a great idea, but I know how things can still get messy (literally and figuratively) when living with a friend. The problems that can arise are endless and maybe some even unavoidable. All we want is for things to work out well, with the least amount of issues as possible. Communication is key and that’s the goal of this Roommate Agreement.
However, there is still that line that we do not want to cross. I want this move-in to be professional as well as friendly. How can my dad and I make the rules clear so that she will take them very seriously without this being like some kind of crazy contract?

Thanks for even reading this!"
ff,"Should I meet estranged grandfather?
I've never met my  grandfather due to him and my grandmother being divorced, and my mother being the ""least favorite"" wants nothing to do with him. However her siblings are super close to him and my cousins have known him their whole lives. I'm not aware of any physical abuse that happened but I know verbal towards my mother and grandmother and their appearances and capabilities occurred as well as blaming my mother for the divorce. He has attempted to apologize to my mother for years and sends her cards which she throws away or returns. If physical occurred I would not want to meet him and I'm wondering if my mother is acting the way she is because she's hiding something.

Also he has never reached out to me but my aunts say he asks about me regularly. He may have not reached out due to the fact my mother won't speak to him. But part of me doesn't want to care if he's not willing to reach out. I'm torn.... Any advice?"

Hey,

Im 22 years old and i still live with my parents, recently it was been very hard for everyone of us. My dad suffers from bad anxiety and most likely depression for the past 3 weeks he got some panic attacks one leading to him calling the ambulance (thinking he was getting a heart attack)

I know for a fact that this has been passed down to me to. I also suffer from anxiety  but i learned more to deal with it now. But  times like this it gets a little harder.

We lost our dog 4 weeks ago and just a week after  that my father lost his brother so its most likely that which is causing the high anxiety and depression(?) 

It brings the whole family down and i'm a bit worried about my father but i don't know what to do.

Therefore, some of the participants of mine lost a small amount of their bet cash (likely because of my foul) and they said it was my fault.

ff,"Thoughts on multi-family and multi-generational households and family disagreements
Basically, I married into a Filipino family, and my MIL owns a fairly large chunk of farmland. She routinely expresses a desire for ""all of us"" (myself, my wife, our two kids, my sister-in-law and her husband, my brother-in-law, his wife, and his kid) to build a large house with a large living area. Each of us (read: each family) would get our own rooms, everyone would live together, and we'd all be one big happy family.

Except, not. I have a number of reasons for saying ""absolutely not"". Maybe it's my POV as someone that was raised in America, but I value independence and privacy. I want my own life, and my wife feels the same. Having family involved in everything you do, always having your kids being compared to other kids in the family, and always being treated like a child just sounds like hell. Not having the freedom to have sex or even choose what to have for dinner sounds like hell. No thanks.

It's be really easy if her MIL wasn't a good person, but she is probably the most kindhearted person I've ever met. She's always there to help us out, financially or if we need anything else. We're there for her the best we can, too, of course. So it feels really bad to turn it down, especially since I understand enough about her culture to know that this would feel like a slap in the face. And there's the financial aspect, since the land is already family-owned. Acting disinterested doesn't work. 

Anyone else have family that has tried this?"
ff,"How do I befriend my crush?
So there's this girl (21/f) that I (21/f) really, really like. I live in a super homophobic country. I've accepted the fact that nothing can happen between us. However, she's just such, such an amazing person, that even if we weren't romantically involved, I would want her in my life, as a friend, because she's just so great - no joke. I'm not sure what her impression of me is. My crush and I actually have a ton of mutual acquaintances and friends. We've even worked together on an event before, but it was a large scale event with a large team, so I didn't really feel much. She once even smiled at me when she saw me!

I have a friend who once had a guy give her chocolate that he “couldn’t finish” when we were in the library. The next day, he messaged her on Facebook, saying she probably felt weirded out by what he did – she responded to him, and they started talking to each other. They’ve now been dating for over a year. The bottom line is, with all this information in mind, how do I approach my crush to hopefully start a friendship with her? I've been warned that I should draw a mental boundary between feelings of friendship and romantic feelings, which I’m set on doing. I would do what my friend’s boyfriend did, but with these chocolate chip cookies I baked, though I'm not sure if it'd be a good idea. It would seem a little weird, wouldn’t it?

Even with my friend’s boyfriend, we knew his intentions from the start. My crush and I are both girls, however, so I suppose that changes things a little (we do live in a heteronormative society). With all that said, I’m pretty desperate, as she’s graduating soon, and I really don’t want to miss my chance. She's completed all her subjects and is currently only working on her dissertation. She's often in the student lounge, doing work - though I'm not sure what her schedule is like and what days she's in campus. Please help with creative ways to approach my crush (like my friend's boyfriend did)! Thanks!"

Aloha Reddit. So I'm a guy and I'm trying to reconnect with an old female friend of mine. Long story short, she stopped talking to me and then I stopped talking to her but she thought I was the one who stopped talking to her and so we ignored eachother for three years even though we go to the same school. Recently, I texted her saying that I apologize. She said that she'd give me a second chance, so I start texting her questions to get to know her again, but she takes hours to answer and when she does answer, all she says is ""Yes/no, you?"" When I ask her a question and ""Haha ok"" when I answer my own question. She even leaves me on read sometimes. Should I stop texting her? I really don't understand why she decided to give me a second chance if she won't even try to support the conversation.

ff,"My little brother was in pain and I didn't help him
I need to get something off my chest that I haven't talked to anyone about before. It's about a situation, where my mother freaked out over my little brother's bratty behaviour. He was about 5 years old and throwing a fit, he was in a really bad moment, he kicked my leg, and all those things weren't pretty. Something must have been bothering him, usually he is a very wonderful person, funny and smart, but just threw a tantrum like every kid does once in a while. When he called me a bitch (his big sister, and I might even have been teasing him) my mother totally freaked out, she scolded him loudly and he already started crying. She went outside to the car and took out his car seat and said she wouldn't need it anymore now that he's not part of the family anymore but will be taken away by child services.

He stood on the front porch and cried his heart out and screamed to my mother ""I don't want to go to the welfare home"" (that's what it was called to him apparently) and he sobbed so desperately and feared for his life and safety. And my mom then looked at him sternly and asked him to apologize and then they hugged and made up.

It is probably the most painful thing in my life. I know he might already have forgotten it and he gets along quite well with my mother (he's a teenager now), but I do think back to that moment and feel that stabbing pain in my chest, as I was standing there passively and watching my mother use him emotionally. He was so fragile and vulnerable, and if I could, I would just wrap him in my arms and love and comfort him, until there's no sadness left in him."
ff,"Am I being too harsh?
I have a cousin(we'll call him Joe) who is the closest thing I have ever had to a best friend.  We used to do everything together.  Throughout the years we would party our asses off in college, spend holidays together, play video games; literally everything together.  About a year ago, I started to notice that he was making some bad life choices.  Particularly, these bad choices involved drinking and driving, pushing relationships away, and hanging out with the wrong type of people.  At first, it didn't really affect our friendship.  We've always respected each others separate lives when we weren't hanging out.  It was when I started to notice the changes mentioned above that I started to bring it up.  One weekend, the whole friendship imploded.  

Some of my friends were coming into town.  Joe was friends with them as well, so I was planning a great time for all of us.  Friday, we went out to a local bar and were all having fun.  Joe has a girlfriend, who wasn't able to join us until the following Saturday morning due to work obligations.  They had been dating for about 3 months, and Joe had been constantly pushing her away, pretending he didn't care about her when I thought she was a stand up gal that could really help him.  That Friday night, Joe ends up making out with an ugly, fat, unnattractive old acquaintenance of ours.  I confronted Joe and told him to cut the shit or I would knock his ass out.  He stopped messing around with the girl and pretended everything was fine.  I confronted him, calling him out for how he chooses to make his life miserable with his actions.  I forced him to tell his girlfriend what he did.  After sending the text, he drove home drunk from the bar.

The next day, Saturday, my friends, Joe, and I all met up at a local event in my hometown.  Joe apologized to me and said he was glad I was there to make things right.  I forgave him and we proceeded to have a great time at the event(which is basically just a big tailgate party).  Near the end of the day, Joe's girlfriend was finally able to show up and join the festivities.  She didn't seem bothered by his actions of the previous night, which made me happy because Joe needed someone like her in his life.  Well, as the evening continued, Joe wouldn't stop drinking.  I kept telling him to take it easy, but it was in his head that he wanted to keep the party going at any rate.

That evening, Joe ditched me and everyone in the group, including his girlfriend, to go to the bars with some random people he met at the local event.  We were all there together, and then he disappeared, gone without a trace or text.  He told his girlfriend to wait in a near by parking lot while he finished partying.  She ended up calling me, crying, asking me to help her find him.  I tried to call Joe multiple times, and was ignored and sent to voicemail.  At this point, I'm full of rage from his actions now and the night prior.  Why would he treat me, his ""best friend"", and his girlfriend like this?  I text him, saying how upset I am and that he needs to be a man and figure his life out becuase he's pushing those closest to him away.  Later that night(around 2AM), I get calls from people at the local event that know me saying that he is making out with random chicks again and eventually was arrested by the police.  They're telling me to come get him before the police take him to jail.  I refuse.  Turned out he didn't actual get arrested(so he claimed), I've never found out the truth of that night.

It's been over a year since I've talked to him.  I don't answer his calls or reply to his texts.  When I go home to my local town, he always texts me and says he wants to come over and visit or that he wants to meet up.  He pretends that his actions didn't completely ruin our friendship.  I demand that he holds himself accountable and changes his lifestyle.  I won't respond to him until he has acknowledged how he has acted and makes an attempt to fix the problem: drinking alchohol and pretending we(closest people in his life) mean nothing to him.

My question:  Am I being too harsh?  Treating him like this breaks my heart.  He was my best friend, we had promised to be each other's best men in our weddings.  I don't know any other way for him to recognize how awful of a person he has become and to help him learn that he can't live his life like this."
ff,"""You can count on me"" That sweet lie.
Maybe this post is a way to vent. Maybe I just need to feel like someone, somwhere has read this and, in a way, I've actually said it.

I don't have many friends, but the ones I do have, I consider them quite close. One of them (let's cal him Joel) is by far the one whom i have a closest relationship with we are bouth 30 right now. I met him as the boyfriend of a workmate about 7 years ago and even after they broke up we stayed as friends.

Joel has a tendency for depression, and I've always tried to help him in any way possible. Because of this problem he ended up hooked on Cocaine, he admited it to me, and we tried everything possible to solve it. So far he seems to be dealing with it reasonably well, but I've had some very rough nights in which i would recieve a text message, wake up at 4 am, grab my keys and drive to his home to literally hold him in my hands while he cried back to sleep and then sand the rest of the night outside his bedroom's door. 

Basically, When I say the words ""You can count on me for anything"" I really mean it, and I think I've proved that to him.

Fast forward to last May and, for the first time in many, many years (before i even met him) I was hit with depression myself for various reasons. 

It hit me hard, suicide attempt hard. 

I tried to deal with it by myself, but finally turned to him and told him what was happening during what I consider the worst night so far in my life. The night I hugged my dog, left him at a friends house ""for a few days because i had to leave the city for work"" and drove to the forest with the intention of not comming back.

In that forest I called Joel in tears, told him whats was happening to me (didnt tell him what i was planning) and he literally said ""I feel bad i can't go there, but I had promissed someone else I havent seen in a while to hang out tonight"" but told me I ""could count on him for whatever I needed"".

To say I was shocked would be an understatement.

Obviously I didnt end my life that day, but I could not believe what had happened. I tried to ignore it, called Joel the very next day and asked him to meet me whenever it was possible.

This was in May.

I would not see Joel's face until September 2nd after basically begging him to meet up.

I'm writing this on November 26, and we have met once since then, a day I had to beg for again in which i planned to tell him how I was dealing with my problem.

He invited a girlfriend he just met and a co-worker to said meeting.

I find myself thinking about this every day, about how a person can be so selfish to have a friend, someone temselves call his best friend, in this situation and proceed to ignore it and basically run away.

After all we have been through this situation is hurting me far more than the reasons that nearly drove me to suicide some months ago.


I want to tell something to everyone who has taken the time to read this.

 

**Never say ""You can count on me"" if you dont mean it,** you may think you do, but consider if you are actually up to the task. Because,** a failure in this regard can completely crush someone's spirit far more than any problem they needed help with in the first place.**"
ff,"Close friend becoming distant....
So I’ve (f,21) had a friend (m,21) that I’ve known for over two years, and we typically text or snap daily. There are times where we are texting or snapping straight for a couple of hours or we get busy with other stuff so we reply when we have a chance. Two weeks ago we had been hanging out at his place and everything to me seemed normal. Then out of the blue this week I feel as though he’s become extremely distant. He stopped basically replying to me at all. It’s been a couple of days in a row that he only responds a couple of times in the morning and then is gone during the entire day. Since I’ve known him, he has never been this way. (I'm sure some might say he's in a relationship, but he's currently single. Plus when he was in a relationship, he didn't act this way.)

So last week I had sent him something early in the day and he didn’t reply until the following day. I didn’t think much of it because the next couple of days we were chatting like nothing and I was sure he was completely busy. Keep in mind, this was a couple days before he basically went blank on me. It actually got me thinking of what I had said that first day and think why he’d be so mad possibly to respond. The day that it had all started I had told him I had applied to a place and had gotten a interview the following day. I told him this even though he’s told me he’s been applying to different places and hasn’t gotten a single interview. When I told him I didn’t think that it would affect him that much since he’s told me he’d never apply to the place I’m gonna start working at. (Like he straight up told me he’d rather die than work at that place.) However, he's not the type to be petty or take things like that extremely hard and to heart.

I’m not sure how I should think about all of this.I have anxiety (which is why I’m stressing) but I’m telling myself he may be going through something and I don’t want to just push him. We’ve gotten extremely close enough to the point where we’ve discussed things that are vulnerable things. He's dealt with major stuff and so have I, so I also find it weird that he wouldn’t talk to me about any of it (if it was something personal).

Should I continue waiting basically a day for a response, or let it ride out and see if he gets back to himself and talks? Do you think he’s trying to ghost me? Or should I ask him what’s happening? (And if I do what should I say so that I’m not exactly targeting him). He has depression and we have discussed serious matters so I don't want to make him feel bad.

Feel free to ask any questions. Thanks!"
ff,"Estranged mum possibly dying
Hi so I'm basically in need of some help here with a big issue from people who have possibly experienced something similar.
So it's a long story and I'll try and keep it to the parts the are mine to tell to keep things less complicated. So first things first me and my mother have had a somewhat rocky relationship from since I can remember, it was more of a rollercoaster and have been estranged for a year. Although the intense emotional disrupt from the relationship has lasted much longer. 
A brief history of this would be as follows, since a young age my mum has never been the ""settle down type"" she was always away either to holidays guys she would meet online would take her on too out every weekend. Me and my sister had to learn fast from a young age that we weren't able to live a childhood like most of our friends and basically raise our little brother. Sometimes she would be caught leaving us alone for so long and we'd have to stay with her friends so she wouldn't get in trouble and others we'd have to just make sure not to miss school so she wouldn't get caught. After years of this repeated behaviour some days easier some harder living from feast (when mum would bag herself a wealthy guy) too mum didn't win at bingo this week and a 40 fag a day habit is expensive habit to keep up why don't you just have beans on toast tonight, ofcourse I know that this is better than alot of kids we had a roof over our head and food in our stomachs it was always just chaos. Cut forward to my mum deciding she wanted to move back to ireland.
I was about 10 at the time and and as such didn't want to move that's when the abuse went from none of my boyfriend's stay because of my kids too physical, she had us all so scared saying that while we were staying with grandad and granny and they heard us complaining this is what we'd get she kick us or grab us, I had been beaten before by my dad before he left so this was nothing I couldn't handle and until now never really tried to think about since. I just remember that I stayed very quiet for those coming weeks.
When we moved to Ireland it was just after the first week a man showed up at my grandparents came in kissed my mum and said hello to me and my sister and said he was so glad to meet us. Turned out he was engaged to mum.....and they were planing on being married within the year, all of a sudden the reason for moving became clear. So After the breakdown of their relationship the next week the man moved back to America in the night and that was that here we were living with my grandparents in Ireland with no where else to go, my mum a big believer of why would I have to work I have kids stuck. Now I know from mum's point of view this must of been a heart breaking moment, but looking back I think this is where alot of my sadness in life begins and I hate her for it. I know hate is a horrible thing to hold onto but it's the only thing that got me where I am today and kept me as a person and I'm definitely aware I'm no Ghandi so judge me all you want but wait until I'm finished atleast.

The next few months were basically limbo, we moved too late to start the term at school so had to wait until the end of term and summer to join, that's from April till September if I'm remembering right of living in the middle of nowhere in Ireland, sleeping in a room with your young brother older sister nothing to do but wait for the day to end we would take walks here or there and get to go to mass on a Saturday night but minus that it's all we had I realised then that mum had failed to do the one thing that kept giving me hope that one day we could have a ""normal"" family she was nowhere to be found off on holidays for weeks one after the other while our grandparents fed us and kept us in their home. I remember a week going by without hearing anything from her and I had to assume that's it she's gone.

Yet she came back this time more shiny and brand new then ever, she said she had found us a house not to far away and go to school and it was the start of our new life. So ofcourse I felt overwhelmed at how amazing this might actually be. Mum made sure though to show her appreciation that Christmas by starting a huge family row with my her brothers and my grandparents, they had all chipped in to buy me and my siblings bigger toys for Christmas, I got a playstation 2 my sister got clothes and makeup and a bike my brother got lego ect that kind of thing, now Christmas was never a thing for us mum had explained from a young age that the santa thing was a lie and we would get what she could afford again this is not as bad as it sounds I'd rather the truth always and she at the end of the day was a single mother why would we expect anything ""big"" so ofcourse she didn't like the gesture and disowned everyone there etc
But we were moving to new house and starting a new life what more could I have wanted. So after living in the new house for a week mum decided that now my sister was 14 she could come on a ""girls"" holiday with her and as such they went the next week I think my sister was just happy to be out of school so went plus I didn't mind my brother was older and didn't need as much attention any more so I kinda looked forward to it, after they came back my sister let me know that she had done it again and gotten engaged and tried to warn me I guess that atleast I could know beforehand this time, the guy she was engaged to worked abroad the entire time so mum basically worshipped the computer so she could talk to him all the time she would sleep the same time as him (during the day) and be up all night, if ever the internet would go down or the house wasn't cleaned or dinners weren't in the house she would freak sometimes more physical then not, up until the day she said we were moving again so long story short the guy moved over they were engaged I was still never told by my mother and I had to sit through the guy explaining how he was gonna be my new dad for 4 hours while we drove to our new home, setting the scene it was a country bungalow which hadn't been lived in for years but me and my sister had done stuff like this in the past so we started into doing it up mum didn't like the physical side of it but loved the planning so she kept busy for a while, quick side note, I loved school, hated the abuse for being the English guy in an Irish school, I had ended up in hospital etc due to some of the abuse, we lived quite happily for a while until my ""new dad"" went back abroad to work for the summer, I started work that summer and so did my sister, my mum would be obcessed with my step dad when he was working who he saw etc until she decided he was definitely cheating (he wasnt) and decided she would too, she spent ages trying to get me and my sister to set up dating profiles for her and to cover on the phone if ever she was out on dates, when he returned as you could imagine arguments between them started and one thing my mother is good at is arguing she was always able to make him think he had done something wrong and she did nothing it didn't help that mum would threaten to throw us out if we ever told him what happened. So that was us for a while weeks of calm and weeks of arguing. Mum must have decided to quit the online dating world for a while and started into online poker, she would find out how much we would earn and take that as rent and spend it on online poker, she would take out debts, spend it on online poker, take my stepdads wages, spend it on online poker, this isn't a film so I won't say she was ever good or ever won, or more anything she did win didn't go straight back in. That summer we went with my step dad to his job abroad the company only could afford a one bed flat for the five of us and to keep stuff private I won't say place names but it was a tropical island, 5 people, one bedroom, one bathroom and since there was a casino down the road thanks to mum no money. That's when I realised that no matter how seemingly redicoulous the situation we were just furniture in mum's whirlwind lifestyle. One instance I'll go into detail would be this one from that summer. I had saved  £300 pound in secret we didn't have enough money for clean water or food for the next 4 days so I thought you know what I'll just say that I had a little bit of money I didn't realise I had and buy food etc. So I did, mum seen the food swore and gave off loads had me return it and took the money to the casino.....that is one instance of many. 
So after that summer mum went back to her online poker and we went back to normal until the next summer when mum decided she wanted to go to America with a friend from online, no prize for guessing what kind of friend, and that's the summer when I kind of shut down, I stopped eating and I stopped caring, I finally thought maybe if I very quietly and very slowly wasted away it would all be ok I didn't need to be around. I would cook everyone else's Meals and just say I had something to eat while cooking, I lost 4 stone in 2 months. Even as im typing this its hard to write. I talked to my mother once in those two months, the time she had no money and needed help. I went into auto pilot I would wake up clean the house play playstation with my brother make dinner and stay up till 3 in the morning with background noise sometimes I cut myself sometimes I would exercise till I vomited, I was slowly dying and that goal was what got me through the day that one day hopefully I wouldn't wake up, my sister was too busy with her new boyfriend and I didnt want to ruin her happiness my brother was too young to understand I thought and my step dad just wanted a clean house and for what he was wearing to work and eating at work to be sorted. 

So then the message came that mum wanted us to come to America and stay with her for a bit. Once there at the airport was the first time I'd seen my mum cry. The first time shed shown genuine concern for me, in fairness being ""big boned"" in our family was normal we are tall and none of us underweight, and there I stood 16 years old 6ft1 and a total of 8 stone must of been mad for her I guess.
So if you guessed it right remember no prizes she was in America with another man he like all of mum's affairs seemed nice but not really in it for the kids they would have their relationship and we would be in the background. A million times o wanted to tell the poor guy but being stranded in a different continent didn't seem like something that we could get out off so I kept quiet. Things went on as they would mum would act like she was single and we'd have to agree with whatever lie she told. Her visa ran out and we had to go back home.
These times seem like they should involve more but at this point I was too numb to the world I didn't register it I would live in the lie I had to and disconnect.

Mum and my stepdads relationship continued to take on more strain every time with more and more intensity. Mum did try a little more to be a mother to me and even took me to doctors apointments to help try and deal with my depression and ofcourse I don't blame her for it I had decided what I wanted to do and I am responsible for that. Our relationship improved a little and I actually gained some nice memories. 

So in the next year something well something really bad happened to me, I don't like going into too many details but the overall was I taken advantage of by someone I thought I could trust and to this day I still struggle with calling it rape but deep down I know that it was, my sexuality had never been a big deal to me as id always known and never acted on it but I told someone for the first time and well yeah non consenting acts occurred.

The reason why I'm saying this is because Its what lead me to try to come out to my mother, our relationship was at its best and so I felt I needed to tell someone what had happened to me and at the very least try and get some help because I was already mental as fragile as I was.

The long and short is it didn't turn out well, I mean imagine your worst situation and how low you felt. Now sink a little lower.

I tried to tell my friends and get help and if not for one person I don't think I would have made it through.

I still had to finish school though and with only a year left I lived through that situation and my past experiences taught me how to become numb.

Cut to me getting the results I needed and getting into the course I wanted. 

I moved out after much arguing and for the first time I was free to be the person I knew I could be, I made so many new friends i gained weight for the first time I was always independent and knew I was happy. Like actually happy.

I met a guy the most thoughtful caring person and still to this day I think I'm glad I didn't die because every day is worth whatever he'll I went through

Stuff with mum was still messy but it was away and in it's neat little box of past baggage. She would ring and talk about a new guy she met and then talk about how much she loves my step dad.

I finally thought you know what last chance I'm going to tell her about the guy in my life and if she didn't like it then I could move on and understand that maybe she wasn't supposed to understand and leave it at that but to my suprise she seemed fine with it.

Weeks past he met my family and my mum was lovely it was weird like she was a different person out relationship became so much better she still borrowed money shed never give back and cheated but we could talk about other things normal things.

Things continued with their ups and downs for a few years I carried on being happy and asked the guy to marry me which he said yes too. That's when the bigger troubles started.

So a quick list.
Mum wouldn't allow him to keep the engagement ring on.
She demanded monthly visits regardless of what was happening
Started alienating his family and comparing their lives and how different they were to us
Pitting my brother and sister against me and themselves

And just general, idk mental abuse without sounding too intense it was weird because anytime it would get seriously intense and be basically ruining any day to day stability she would stop and be nice again for a few weeks. 

It was unfair to my fiance though alot of the time it felt as if she kept making situations in which he would have to increasingly prove him self with the more he would do. Sometimes it came down to outright having to prove his love to me and became more and more frequent. She started to try and control our wedding ie spending, decor etc. 

The event that started the end was when we had to unfortunately rehome our cat due to him not getting along with our dog etc this sent mum berserk she rang my work demanding to speak to me and completely dressed me down on the phone and my fiance and how dare we calling me and my fiance worse than our father's  (both of which had left us as kids)
She said we weren't to rehome it and weren't allowed etc. My sister and brother got involved and were repeating my mother's words. Showing the same cycle of go along with mum or terrible things happen. 

So then there was an issue with Christmas this is a long one so to keep it short basically how dare I suggest to go to my fiances family even though he had been to ours and how as my mother I am not allowed at this point I'm 23 years old.

Straw that broke the camel's back, mum's dog unfortunately died, and with work I wasn't able to make it down and neither was my fiance, we were barred from the ""open house"" they decided to do for the dog and we received phone calls daily calling us all the names under the sun. My fiance had recently got a job with the nhs and was starting it on the Monday and as such said on Facebook he was happy to about this. Now I got a phone call from my mother but it wasn't a sane person it was unbelievable and to this day still scares me, from moments maniacal laughter to screaming to whispering she did it all at how dare he be happy on the day her dog was being cremated......it was some scary stuff like I am a huge animal lover yes but the way she felt personally attack that someone had something good in their life when she didnt that day was disturbing. That night my sister calls and is basically the same except for the line ""if you can't attend dog funerals then we can't attend weddings"" and that was it. That was the moment. 

I hung up the phone saying I wish them happiness and health and that if this is the way it is then that's it.

And that was it I blocked them from contacting me and had one of the best years of my life.

I have become mentally stronger, I am happier and I'm well I feel like the person I'm supposed to be.

Until today I get a message from an account on Instagram ""mum has cancer can you give me a number to contact you on""

Now in all this I haven't even mentioned everything like the fact mum has pretended to have a heart attack before and has lied about equally as worse.

I know it's a horrible thing to not want to reach out after a message like that but I don't want to go back to the pain I was in before I feel like can't breathe when I even think about giving my number and know that even if it's true and she does have cancer that I could never have a relationship that isn't toxic with these people I need advice and help but mostly I needed to share so thanks if ya read this far there's so much to this and I feel like I haven't even mentioned half the stuff that happened but please do I stick to social norms and try and be a good son or do I put my mental health first.

Thanks"

ff,"Should I still communicate with my father?
Hello everyone. So the past few days my mom caught my dad cheating on her (2 women specifically). Now my mom sent him a closure to cut the ties (we live on the US while my dad is on another country). I'm angry and familiar with this feeling as well because my previous girlfriend cheated on me too (I guess it runs on the blood to be cheated on).

Right now I don't know if I should cut my ties as well, as I can't forgive someone who broke my mom's heart and also someone who can't be contented at all. I'm 24 and take full responsibility on her. Our little family is all what my mom have, as she never worked her whole life and expended it to nurture us her children, giving up her career and dreams."

We all got that fucked up incident in our families, right? Well, Imma vent about mine, cause it real fucked. For me at least, right, so am a naive virgin eighteen year old, wanna yknow experience sex and dig a guy and stuff, so I go on the dating apps and meet a lad, real nice too, sweet and that, I obviously am attracted to him. So we date and do all the couple stuff like movies and sex and I am on cloud nine cause he an older man so like am cool at school (super super shallow and lame but yknow, naive virgin eighteen year old trying to live up to social pressures exerted by my peers). Anyway, I like the dude, and we fall for each other, we married now with kids so we chill. Right, so a month or two in, he gets all funny on a night out and makes us go somewhere quiet away from our mates, which I dont catch onto cos yknow am like shitfaced and cant feel my face so I dont realise nothing is up at all. Right so he says to me, I shagged a girl before you and am like dude thats not a surprise yknow you told me you had women before me. That shit fair enough cause hes older and yknow its normal for partners to experiment before settling for one. And he goes well I like you, a lot, and I dont want this girl to ruin shit and am like, well I dont see how you arent still shagging her are you? he isnt still shagging her right, so yknow good boy, however, he shagged her before me, like six months before me and yknow what can happen in six months? A goddamn baby can grow in the mofo womb during that time. Hes pissed, he was like I told her it was a shag, she agreed, told me she was on the pill and it mustve glitched that month (as the story always goes) and she got preggaz. I told her to terminate (dude this is a condensed version of the story, there was emotion and shit behind it, so dont go all prolife on me, it's just a minor detail im trying get out there and passed so I can tell the rest of the story). Right, so she starts kicking off saying hes emotionally black mailing her into an abortion and talking about a baby she lost as a teen and shit and am like, okay so just back off. He did, and she came back a few months later like lol theres another guy, not sure if hes the dad or not, I think its you tho. Like, good, thanks bitch, a think its you is all the proof I need. So she sends him laods of scans and basically pretends hes her baby daddy. Annoyed me a bit cos yknow i was a teen wanting to mess round and just yknow settle with this guy and this chick is trying to like worm her way in. She makes friends with his sister on fb (weird cos he doesnt have contact with any of his family, hasnt for like four years prior that) and starts getting pally with his mum dad brothers, all of them. Tells them I was his mistress and they were a couple, they decided to have a baby, and when she got pregnant he started messing round with me, a teenage girl. Fews holes in that story but well skip ahead, and the baby is born. They get this dodgy dna that says its not admissable in court due to infrequencies or something and that close relatives (she was shagging his brother at the time too) could skewer results. Basically the baby daddy could be his bro but itll come back his cause its a shit dna. Anyway it came back the baby was his and he suddenly goes all fatherly. Doesnt see the kid for like six months then starts visits and pays maintance. Meanwhile, shes fucking round going to his family and bitching about how horrible I am being a homewrecker and all that eventho they were a shag and got with him six months after her. He wont get another dna cause he was like paid for one not doing another, and I explained the issues but he wont. ALl our children look identical, the kid has blond hair and blue eyes, me and my partner are both dark and so are our kids, (the girl in question also is dark so where the fuck blond blue eyes came from is beyond me). For months after she kept ringing me saying omg you need to put him on the phone the babys sick and he needs to visit, and if you ignore it shed up it and be like an ambulance is coming now omg its serious (it never was). The kid was in hospital like twenty times in his first week of life, each time let out with nothing serious wrong, altho she exaggurated and made out he was on the brink of death. Tries to get him to take her kids out while Im in mofo labour, giving birth and shes kicking off on the phone saying hes not spending enough time with them. Once I gave birth comes round screaming and shouting how hes off the birth certificate, how shes changing the kids name and how shes taking him to court for more money yhadda yhadda yhadda. Mama from Hell, legit worst parent and just a nightmare to deal with, the shit that baby been through already, feel sorry for it.

ff,"Best guy friend is ignoring me, and I don't understand why
My best guy friend ""Jake"" (not his real name) have known each other for 14 years. We are now both 19 years old. Of all the friends I currently have, I've been friends with Jake the longest. We first met in kindergarten. I used to be really chubby and shy when I was much younger, so I got picked on a lot. Jake was my only friend back when I was in elementary school and middle school, and he stood up for me a lot back then. In high school, I started to grow out of my childhood awkwardness, lost a significant amount of weight, and managed to find a small group of friends in my school's anime club. Throughout all this, Jake was a very steady, loyal, and supportive friend, and I'm forever grateful to him for that. We ended up getting into different colleges, both around an hour away from our hometown. Even though things got somewhat busy at times, we kept in regular contact and found time to hang out when we were both in our hometown at the same time.
Recently, I met a great guy ""Aaron"" (not his real name) in college. We started dating. I wanted him to meet my friends from back home, so I arranged a time to meet for dinner. During our meetup (I invited 3 friends from high school, including Jake), I noticed that Jake was unusually quiet. He didn't say much of anything during our dinner. I thought it was a bit weird because he is normally really talkative (I'm usually the quieter one in our friendship), so I pulled him aside and asked him what's wrong. He said nothing, so I figured nothing was wrong.  
That meetup was two months ago. About two weeks ago, I reached out to Jake on Facebook to ask him how things are going and to try to catch up on life. He completely ignores all my messages. I tried texting him to ask if he's mad at me. No response. I don't understand. I feel completely blindsided by this because Jake has never gone more than one day without responding to my messages. A mutual friend told me that she always suspected that Jake liked me, but I highly doubt that. He never showed any signs of liking me back when we were in high school, and he had a couple of girlfriends in high school. He's not the shy type, so I highly doubt he would be the type of guy to hide his feelings for so many years."

ff,"Feeling sad for my daughter/realizing grandparents won't live forever
My husband and I had a child later in life. She's 18 months old and her grandparents on both sides are in their mid-late 60's. My parents are very healthy and I don't think of them as ""old"", so I mentioned that my daughter could live close to them if she chose to go to University in the city where they live. My mom chimed up and said that they may both be dead by then (for context, they're Chinese and it's completely normal for them to be this blunt with their children). 

I've had other family members pass away before, but it just hit me that no matter how you prepare yourself for that day, you'll never be ready to say goodbye. It's never enough time.

I immediately felt very sad for my young daughter and just hope that we have lots of time left to bond and make memories. We live 5 hours away by car, so it's hard to see them as regularly as we'd like, but we try to visit and have them visit as often as we can. I just hope she gets to spend as much time as possible with them."
ff,"Apologizing to a family member ?
Not sure if this is the right place to put this?  If it’s not feel free to direct me!  To sum it up,  I’ve highly offended a family member of mine.  I wrote this apology that I can’t bring myself to send them.  I kept telling them how much I wanted to see them and I even flew up to see everyone.  When we were all seated at a restaurant I was having really bad anxiety and didn’t really speak to anyone.  He took this really personal and felt I came off as an asshole.  I didn’t know how to explain the anxiety part of things to him so I gave him a lame excuse about eating spoiled food the night before.  While it was true it wasn’t the reason I wasn’t speaking to anyone.  Then I had went to his house to try and speak to him as I was leaving the next day and he told me not to come.  I did anyway and you can imagine that didn’t end well at all.  He won’t talk to me.  I finally found the courage to type up this apology.  It explains the conditions I suffer from, how they’re debilitating and the trauma I endured that caused them.  The apology I feel is oversharing but I also wanted to explain myself in full and be as genuine as I possibly can.   Nobody knows the things I went through but I’m going to post the apology here for you guys to read for yourselves.  Please don’t judge me too harshly I just don’t want this family member to never talk to me again.   I understand it may come off as a pity me type of thing but I promise it’s not.  

Here it is :


I just wanted to let you how sorry I am.  I should’ve apologized sooner but I wanted to give you time.  I’d like to fully explain myself.  This is really long but it’s genuine.  And I’m not justifying myself in any way as I fully understand that I’ve crossed boundaries and disrespected you but I also want you to have a better understanding of what really happened.  Hear me out before you roll your eyes at what I’m about to say.   Some of this won’t make any sense initially.  But trust me it all ties together.  Whatever decision you make I’d prefer for you not to tell anyone any of this stuff.  This is why I handled certain things the way I did.  I’ve been through a lot of trauma.  Initially it was with Savannah’s dad.  He would beat me, kick me, slap, choke, etc told me my mother would be happy with me gone.  And she was aware and didn’t do anything.  This was when Jody had custody of me but I was visiting them when they had an apartment together.  Eventually I went to live with my dad and his parents.  His mom didn’t want any more kids and she was absolutely terrible to me.  She’d give me Valium to sedate me, swing pots and pans at me, threaten me with knives, lock me out of the house etc.  My dad wasn’t any better as he gave me my first black eye.  School was really difficult as I’d get bullied pretty bad and I’d get myself suspended just to avoid it.  At this point people claimed I had a behavioral issue and I was put on multiple medications I didn’t need.  His mom was able to collect SSI because of this and when Jody found this out she wanted me back.  After a year back and forth to court she won custody in January 2014.  I was 15 at this point.  She promised me a better life but it only got worse.  She kept me locked up in the house for 4 years as she didn’t want me improving and losing the SSI.  Her boyfriend also lived there, he was an alcoholic.  He’d break into my room in the middle of the night to beat and rape me.  Taunt me about how I’ve made previous suicide attempts and would go on about how he’d kill me but he figured I’d do it myself anyway.  I’ve never told anyone as I figured nobody would ever believe me.  Anyway, I was diagnosed with depression, PTSD, Panic Disorder, and social anxiety, and yet most people aren’t aware of a lot of the things I’m telling you right now.  Because of some of these conditions it’s hard for me to socialize with people for the first time.  I wasn’t trying to be distant or cold to you in person but my anxiety makes me seem that way and I’m sorry.  It’s something I’m trying to work on.  In fact it was so bad at one point I wasn’t even able to eat in a restaurant.  I couldn’t open the door if I ordered food.  I was constantly living in fear of being injured, killed, judged, any situation I was faced with I’d think of the worst possible scenario.  It’s even preventing me from getting a license.  Now, when you said I was chatty in text and not in person it really hurt my feelings and I wanted to explain but how do I explain this to somebody?  If I just said oh I have anxiety I felt as if it would’ve sounded like bs.  And I just felt absolutely terrible and I acted on an impulse and I just ended up disrespecting you and crossed boundaries I never should’ve in the first place and I am so so sorry for that.  Some of the things Aunt Connie said to me I took it to heart when I shouldn’t have and it was another contributing factor as to why I had left.  The spoiled meat story was true it wasn’t a lie.  I ate it around 1 in the morning she didn’t give it to me I wasn’t implying she did.  But it wasn’t what made me not say much.  If you were wondering why I had my luggage it’s because I figured you’d be mad,  but let me in.  I didn’t have enough money to uber all the way back so that’s why I brought my stuff.  It was idiotic I know.  I’m sorry.  Also,  I realize I’ve done things prior to this that have annoyed you.  And if I could get another chance I promise I won’t do those things again.   Sorry for those things as well.  I understand if you find it strange for me to tell you all of this but I’m sick of people not understanding how hard it is to deal with anxiety.  I wish I could do what normal people do without having racing thoughts and feeling like I’m about to pass out or worry about what people think of me or feel they’re laughing at me.  I wish I was normal but I’m not.  There isn’t an off switch.  Granted they don’t know all of this but now that you do I hope you believe me when I say it’s not an excuse.  If you have any questions about this stuff or anything in general you can ask I just hope you’re not mad at me anymore.  And maybe if possible I could come up again in a few months and try again ?  I know I gave a really bad first impression and it’s hard to shake that but I’d like to try and fix that as well.  Plus I never really got to know you all that well like I did with Aunt Connie and Uncle Paul.   And she basically told me I’m never welcome there again because I left.  I mean we texted but you get what I’m saying right ?  This is long and now I’m rambling sorry but I feel so much better now that I’ve said all this it was bothering me.  I just don’t have too many people in life right now.  And I know even when I first started talking to you on Facebook I would you send you pictures of alcohol and talk about drugs and I want to briefly go into that.  I was never hooked on anything hard.  I watched my mom lose everything from her health to her kids.  I did smoke weed, cigs, drink, and xannies.   I lived with an older cousin who pressured me but at the same time it was a way to escape my pain.   It wasn’t easy watching my mom nod out and Aunt abuse my brothers and sisters and only keep them for money.   And being stuck in that house everyday and dealing with an alcoholic.   I was never necessarily hooked on anything besides cigarettes but I didn’t want to look 40 by 30 so I quit those too.  It overall made my mental health even worse.   I finally cut all of that out and that’s when I heavily turned to food.  Then I gained almost 100 lbs and that was another reason I didn’t wanna talk to anyone because I felt absolutely disgusting but I’ve lost most of it now!  I’m back down to 180.  12 pounds until I’m a healthy weight.  But my point is I’m not that kid anymore I promise you.  I wasn’t even when I went up there there’s just more to everything than you initially see ya know?  And I’m not my mom I would never ask you for a dime.  I promise you I’m not a bad person if you really get to know me.  I’ve just had a lot of things I had to go through and I feel pretty much broken as a person but I’m trying to put myself back together it’s really difficult but I don’t have any choice but to go forward.  Believe me I still want to end it sometimes but I somehow manage to keep pushing on every day.   Talking to you, and Aunt Connie, and Uncle Paul made me feel like I had a chance of having some decent family members you know?  And I don’t really know you all that well to say how you are as a person but you seemed really nice.  And then I screwed it up with everyone.  It just made me feel like I’d finally have what I always wanted and I should’ve been realistic as I didn’t grow up with you guys, none of you know me like that, and I should’ve kept myself in line.  I just hope that you’d be willing to give me a second chance.  Again, I genuinely am sorry for all the unnecessary drama I’ve brought into your life.   But, I’m really lonely and I’d love to have some family that doesn’t hurt me.  I tried to explain the anxiety to Aunt Connie but she didn’t get it.  She thought I was just being rude whenever there was company or I was at her brothers house.  Of course I didn’t tell her everything I told you because I didn’t feel comfortable.  And it’s still uncomfortable telling you all of this but I felt that I owed you a proper explanation.  I mean I kept talking about how I wanted to see you and then didn’t even speak to you in person how much of an asshole I probably came off as."

ff,"Frustrating Friend
So my friend loves to catch up for coffee. Invites 10 or so of us to one session to catch up with as many of us as possible.
I'm a SAHM with a nearly 3 year old and 8 weeks off giving birth to my second. I'm also dealing with my husband being in a new job so it's a new routine for our boy. It's also a 40 minute bus ride into the city each time, maybe longer sometimes coz our weather is crap most of the time (take note).
My friend knows this but constantly badgers me to come for coffee whenever HE has free time. He just started a new job as of yesterday. Before this he had free time 24/7.
I told him in a huge message how my circumstances make it hard to just head into the city when he asks and that I can manage it on days I have midwife appointments.
He replied that he had just as much responsibilities that he had to deal with but he managed to still come into town to visit everyone. 
It feels like he just ignored what I was saying and that meeting him was more important.
Soooo frustrated!! What do I do? Am I a crap friend or does he need to understand where I'm coming from better?"
ff,"Is it bad that I am kind of mad my friend never follows my advice?
The friend in question and I have been friends for over 7 years and best friends for the last 3 years and have shared just about every detail of our life. I am a very observant person and have seen many repetitions in her behavior over the last years. 
The heading is a bit misleading here. I am not mad at her that she doesn’t follow my advice. Rather, I am somewhat annoyed that she keeps making the same mistakes with the same toxic people in her life. I have been telling her that many of the people she surrounds herself with are very manipulative and are using her in one way of another as she has actually realized that, however she can’t seem to actually do anything about this and keeps sacrificing her own needs to satisfy those of the people around her. This doesn’t just happen once or twice, but it happens almost on a daily basis and I can basically feel her mental stability deteriorating. I have been telling her for forever that she should focus on her personal growth and leave the toxic people in her life behind. I know that that is super hard to do and super easy to says and that you can’t follow that super easily and I have been trying very hard to be as supportive as I can and listen to her and be a shoulder to cry on. But it’s also very hard to see her being hurt over and over again by the same type of people or even the same person when there is a solution to the problem. And it seems like she isn’t learning and instead she is just getting more and more insecure and anxious and her panic attacks are increasing in frequency because of these people. And it also makes me very anxious when I constantly worry about her. But I don’t want to guilt or manipulate her into any decisions. And I don’t know what to do. help pls im desperate."

Sorry if this isn’t the right sub. Just need an outsiders opinion on this issue. My dad will often make *jokes* about my weight, for example: Tonight we were having dessert and I didn’t want any, he told me to stuff it in my fat little face. A few days ago, I was eating chips and he said I’m gonna get chubby, before that, he says stuff like “Nobody likes the fat chick” He says I’m gonna “get fat like my mom when I’m older” that’s another thing, my parents are divorced due to my mom cheating and if I’m being sarcastic towards him or anything he says “I’m gonna give you to your mom if you’re not careful.” It’s like I’m an object instead of a person? I do a hell of a lot of housework and all, it hurts to hear him *joke* about that.

I just feel like this isn’t something you should say to your 15 y/o daughter. He’s a great dad besides the comments he makes here and there. I got pretty upset by the comment he made tonight cause I’ve been dealing with weight issues and self esteem. He didn’t understand why I got upset cause it’s a joke to him. I dunno, am I being overly sensitive?"
ff,"My Wifes Car, Money, and My Brother. What do I do?
My wife and I got married, but instead of an engagement ring, we decided I would buy her a car instead. I brought the Toyota and moved in. She already owned another Honda. This way we would have 2. 
Eventually, she gave her Honda to her brother (who was also in need), and I told her she could give it to him because her dad had initially bought the Honda anyway, not her, so he has every right to own that Honda especially since we had 2 at the time. Keep i mind that it was ultimately my decision, not hers, to let him have the car, because although I'm married to her and her dad bought her the car, I felt like since her dad ""bought"" it, he has the right to it, and since her brother is her dads ""male"" descendant, he has the right to the car. (Sorry we're an asian family)
So now we have 1 Toyota (the engagement ring car). With a baby on the way, we decided we would lease another Nissan ourselves, so we could have 2 cars again.
Recently my brother was involved the Caribbean island Hurricanes where he goes to Med School, and his whole semester was shifted back to America until either this August or December. 
So now he's also in need of a car for about 8-9 months. I told my wife that since we are leasing a Nissan, we can let my brother borrow our current Toyota for the time being. 
My wife doesnt want to give up the Toyota to him in fear that she will lose it.
I thought this was unjustified because she gave her Honda to her brother, so why can't I let my brother borrow the Toyota too? 
Both of us grew up believing in ""helping"" a person in need, and I feel like I went out of my way to let her brother have a car that was rightfully hers, but she didnt let me do the same when it came to my brother. But then again, I feel like she does have a right to the Toyota because it was a replacement for an engagement ring at the time. 
After her brother took the Honda, we have been using 1 car for the last year. I figured we could keep using 1 car for another 8-9 months if it means saving my parents some money in buying my brother a different car. 
Am I wrong here? Is she technically right? Am I unreasonable because what we do with the car should be my wife's decision, since it was a replacement for her ring?"
ff,"“Best friend” didn’t invite me to celebrate 21st.
I’ve been friends with this girl for over ten years. We were our first best friends. We ended up going to different schools throughout high school and college, but we never drifted too far. 
Yesterday, she turned 21. She was coming into town to go to a local bar, but I’m not of age yet. She told me I could come, but I figured she was just going to be there with her boyfriend and other friends who are 21. I didn’t want to sit there drinking a Sprite while they all got drunk, so I let her enjoy her evening. I figured she would celebrate later again anyway (which she is.) 
Today, she posts on her Snapchat story her and all our mutual friends (underage friends) drinking and having fun over in one of our friends apartments. I was not invited. I got her a gift and was ready to celebrate with her. I’m pretty disappointed, hurt, and feeling lame as usual. 
This has been a common theme for the past couple of years. She hangs with a select group of about 5 or 6 people who I’ve known longer than her. I don’t really get invited to anything at all, only once in a blue moon. She sometimes tries to hang out with me when she comes into town from college.

No names or genders here, and I'm not getting into specifics on events just in case...


I have one friend who consistently wants to hang out, unlike my other friends, but the problem is that over the last few years I've started liking them less and less. They're fun to talk to and hang out with -usually- but their personality grates on me and there have been a few times when they have made me quite angry in ways that are difficult to reconcile. They can also end up being a downer though they have been working on it. An unknown quantity of my other friends also dislike them (I know a few for sure, but who knows how many they've pissed off in the meantime) so I either have to plan events without them (and they get upset) or not invite my other friends who dislike them.


We've known each other for years, and they consider myself and a few others very close friends but I have gotten the distinct impression it's one-sided. But they haven't done anything wrong (to ME) that would really merit breaking up a friendship so I've kept begrudgingly hanging out with them and chatting with them even though I'd rather not and just forget they exist. At one point I was one of very, very few friends they had, but I know they have a good consistent friend group now so...


I don't know! Advice, please? Is it ok to just not want to be friends anymore even if the other person hasn't done anything wrong? When I think about hanging out with them even though I know we'd probably do something fun I just feel apprehensive and mildly annoyed."

I had a friend who I thought she could be my real friend. I’ll call her hailey. I one told her a secret and she spoiled it to the whole school. I still gave her a chance. She started being really harsh on me and what I like which is photography. She would always insult me and say negative things that makes me think negative. I realized that we didn’t really go well and that our interests are very different. So We kinda stopped hanging out often. I tried my best to be funny and social. My friendship between my friends (Natalie and Monica)  were getting better but I was still the one that they didn’t really care. Now hailey is trying so hard to be friends with Monica, Natalie and maybe me. Natalie knows that she’s trying to “be like us” but Monica doesn’t. Monica is slowly hanging out with hailey. Hailey started to ask me what I like to wear and all the small stuff. And she also wouldn’t stop talking about my crush and his best friend. Which is uncomfortable for me. her personality changed and I realized she is actually trying to be like my friends.  I currently don’t know who should I be friend with since I don’t have a best friend. It’s quite embarrassing when I have to get a pair because I have no one. I don’t know what to do."

I'm a guy who doesn't like having to wait for others. I get things done faster on my own. He was coming an hour away and he's visiting from out of state so he doesn't know the area. Apparently he was gonna borrow a friends car but wasn't sure all before the game started in a few hours. I was like screw it I'm not dealing with this.

I basically convinced him not to go saying it was too expensive and that you'll get lost. I was being honest and he agreed. I wasn't gonna wait for him not knowing when he would arrive. I still went and I don't care. Sometimes you just have to be selfish and look out for yourself. Others can hold you back."
ff,"overbearing family.
I (19f) am living away from home for college in my 2nd year. However, I still feel very under the control of my mother. It is just me and her at home, and rest assured she has always done her best for me but recently I’ve had enough of how much she expects from me. I am studying for grade 6 piano and the fact is that I simply don’t have time for it. She wanted me to do the exam for it after only studying it for 3 months (bare in mind I only get to practice once a week as I have no piano away from home - I come home at weekends). When I postponed it she screamed at me for hours and called me an idiot and various other things. I told her I was too busy with college work, I got my results back for college and did very well; however, she still wasn’t happy. First comment was “maybe you’re not as stupid as we think” and then said that I could do a lot better, even though I did really well. 

I never leave the house when I’m at home for weekends or any holidays because when I go out or meet my friends she makes it very difficult as she usually starts a row before I leave and guilt trips me about going. 

I have been wanting a full time bar job for summer, as that’s where my experience is but she is even controlling where I work and telling me where to apply to. She keeps guilt tripping me about being away for college, and saying I’m on a permanent holiday. 

She is annoyed at me for having a boyfriend; she never uses his name only refers to him as “your friend” in a sneering voice, and she won’t meet him. 

She is by no means a bad person, she has always been a very good mother but the pressure she is putting on me is too much and I feel very restricted, and at times, controlled. BUT I am not giving out about her, simply want to understand why she is acting this way when I’ve given her no reason to distrust me and I’m trying my best. 

TL;DR - mother is controlling, putting huge pressure on me and is never happy no matter how well I do."
ff,"My family might break apart...
Sorry this is a long post.
Yes I know this is common thing sadly. But I don’t want it to, 12 years my family have been together.

Just to start off,
There is me, my brother, my dad and mum.

So my dad has anger issues. His parents never told him it was wrong so he has been like this all his life. Our mum is his second wife because his first wife divorced him for all the reasons I’m about to mention.
We only listen to him because he rules out of fear, he isn’t teaching us anything, and is a bad influence on us. When he gets annoyed he yells really loudly on purpose for everyone to hear (including our neighbours) then drives off for an hour. He’s always threatening to me and my brother, “I’LL KICK YOU IN THE FACE”, “YOU’LL END UP IN HOSPITAL.”
I’ve despised him for about 3 weeks and it’s actually a lot better when he drives off and vanishes. Problem is, he makes 80% of our money.

My brother is slowly becoming like my dad.I’m trying to help him, my mum is trying to help him but it isn’t working. I believe he can still change because he’s still young (12). He yells at our parents trying to prove he is right all the time. Problem is, he won’t listen to us unless our dad threatens him and scares him into stopping. Heres the big problem, he is a messy person and our mum is a very tidy person, she tells him all the time clean up but he says, “I’ll do it later”, but never actually does it. So my mum and brother argue often about this. He says he doesn’t care about who he is becoming, but I know he does. Despite all the tension between me and my brother I still love him very much. 

My mum is the only reason our family is still together. She ends up stopping dad from slapping/threatening us and is the one that teaches me and my brother right from wrong. She’s basically carrying our whole family and I feel bad about it. I love her very much and I feel so much empathy for her. She was a good daughter and this is the life she grew up for. It’s sad, really.

And me, I was also becoming like my dad, but ever since Mid 2017 I’ve had a fear of me or my brother becoming like him in the future. I’m using my words, I’m trying not to yell. I’m trying not to walk off after every arguement so I can tame my temper. I’ve slipped a few times, but this fear is actually changing me for the better.
I’m telling my brother not to answer back to our parents but he won’t listen. I’m trying to help my mum because I feel sorry for her. So recently, it’s me and my mum trying to stop my brother from yelling at us, stopping our dad threating/slapping us. I’m trying to get my brother to see the future like me. 

So just yesterday, my brother made a light-hearted joke to my dad and he got mad and slapped him. Later that evening, our mum asked him why he did that. So he drove off and came back at 1am. After this, our mum and dad haven’t spoken to each other. This morning my brother keeps arguing his point to our mum, I try to support her.
My dad has done nothing. All he did was wake up, drove off and come back at 7:30pm to sleep, then he drove off again.
So just a few hours ago, my mum tells my brother to clean up. This causes a arguement. I support mum, but my brother won’t stop yelling. I told him to stop 3 times but he told me, “You don’t have the authority to tel me to do anything”.  After this my mum asks me, “what should we do now?” Then I messaged my brother and things have been solved between us. 

Thats too much arguements for just 2 days, don’t you think? 
And my mum is right, what can we do? 

There’s too much problems with all of us, and we’re all depending on each other so it’s not easy. My mum would’ve divorced dad long ago if she had the money. 
I want me, my brother and mum to live together peacefully away from the bad influence of our dad.

We haven’t called the authorities because my mum is afraid of what will happen to our dad.
We haven’t got outside help because our parents think it’s embarassing.

So, what choices do we have?"
ff,"What do I call my sister that’s not my sister?
This would seem fairly complicated, I have a step brother and my step brother lives in a family his family has his real mum, step dad and step sister his sister isn’t related to my dad or my mom but related to my brother because they both have the same mom and me and my brother only have the same dad but different mom. So basically she doesn’t have my blood but has a brothers blood (my step brother doesn’t live with me) so what am I suppose to call her?"
ff,"My father may have been a monster after all...
I’ll try to make this as short as I can

I am a 32/F both my parents have passed my mom as recently as 12/2016. My father was up in age when I was born. My mom was wife number 5 and much younger. So when he passed in 2013 it was sad but he lived till his nineties. My parents each had two kids from previous marriages that are much older then me. My mom got sick and then was dying for a year. I was her caregiver 100% and she lived with me. I worked two jobs had no days off and was a P/T nanny as well. Which made her so happy to have in the house cause she loved babies. My bro and sister are human garbage. They did nothing for her when she was dying, made life horrible for me, disliked my care for her just all around horrible people who pushed me to the brink of suicide. I cut all ties when she died moved to another part of the state and got a promotion. I’m doing alright now and it’s only been a little over a year. 

So now I had a brother from my dads marriage but he died in a car wreck in 07. My sister from my dads side is all the family I have left. I love her dearly but she has mental issues that are severe. Depression, schizophrenia, anxiety. We live in different states and I tried to get her to move to my state and she Wont she likes where she is. She lives independently and goes to a day program so she manages ok.

Recently she has been upset at my cutting ties with my half siblings her step siblings. I told her I would have no problem with her continuing contact but I would not. Hell my cunt of a shitty sister tried to borrow money from her the majority of the times she called her but still I can’t stop her she is a 50yr old woman.

But now my fragile sister is starting to not do well she is recalling abuse from when she was a teen. Gang rape at 13 multiple rapes in high school etc.  and she said our dad did nothing and noticed nothing

Now I know this could be her illness at play but....I think I believe her.  She got sick or I should say her schizophrenia came to the front lines in her early 20s after she graduated college and had a pretty damn good job. I wasn’t even born yet but my mom was in the picture.

(My mom and her were very close) 
When my sister had her breakdown she described horrible rape and  abuse in the middle of delusions and episodes. My mom said my dad thought it was her sickness but as my mom put it the way she described it happening it originated somewhere. Whether delusions morphed her memories my mom thought it happened to her.

So now this sister only has me to vent to. I tried to call her case manager but as she is an adult and hasn’t been hospitalized in decades she won’t let me speak to her. I’m going to call her day program and try to speak to someone about her seeing a rape counselor or something along wit her regular treatment.

In a way I don’t want to deal with something this heavy again and I know that’s selfish I lost years of myself helping care for my dying father then 100% for my mom I was pushed to the brink of my own sanity

And then there is the fact that I think my father did do nothing. I was his favorite and I know I was. He never hit me and my mom but he was verbally abusive. But he favorited me cause I am the most like him. He valued education and ambition and I think he felt my sister failed him being sick along with my brother. He acted as a father and I have good memories of him but he wasn’t exactly a emotional or loving person to my mom or at times me. But I guess I got the little he had in him. 

Now I’m starting to wonder if he was a sociopath or fuck a damn monster. 

After my brother who would be said sisters full brother died in what we thought was a regular car accident I found out it wasn’t. He was on pills and had an addiction and was telling people  this shit will kill me. And from the police report witnesses state he just veered into a pole never hit anyone or anything. Just went into a tree.

My fathers first two children ended up like they did and then there is is me. Without my mom would I have been something different? 

While I pulled myself out of the hole I thought I was in, I haven’t done well in dating or making friends in my new city. before my parents illnesses I was good at it.

I’m afraid I’m doing ok with all these losses because I am like him. 

Through my job I’m booking sessions with a therapist but im still scared to pick up the phone when my sister calls

I know I sound really selfish"

ff,"How To Befriend Someone I Had An Awkward Past With?
I had this female friend that I met almost two years ago. Both of us were really nice with each other and we were pretty good friends at first, but my introverted mind did not help with that. After a while I started to have feelings for her and I started bringing up topics that did not concern her and was too awkward. I used to always text her almost every single day of every single hour to the point that she told my friend that I was annoying her (I knew that a couple of months later). I knew that something was up and that I made her upset but I never really knew what it was. I tried many different approaches to become her friend again but it all lead back to her thinking that I want to date her (she is not the type of person who would want to date at this age). After a year or so is when I figured out that I made her uncomfortable and gave her the notion that I wanted to talk to her only to date her and nothing else. I had an idea to confront her and apologize to her and tell her the truth of what I wanted from her but I keep having panic attacks and anxiety every time I think about doing it. What do you guys think I should do? Some might say that I should leave it behind, but I did such a horrible thing to such a great person and in all my life I have never met someone so true, genuine and wholesome in my life so I cannot give her up and make her feel this way about me. Would appreciate hearing from you people by assisting me. Thanks a bunch! :) <3"

Hello there, dear redditors. I truly need your advice and every opinion is highly appreciated, so feel free to express whatever's on your mind. I'll try to keep things as short as possible, so here's the problem. I know a friend of mine since we were 7 and now i'm 23. Recently (for a month or two) i started allowing new people in my life, which is pretty unusual for me and it got so overwhelming and intense that i didn't notice i started building distance with my best friend because i concentrated on new people too much. Eventually we got so far from each other that we barely even talk. We still respect each other and are chatting on occasion trying to look like we're still those ""good old friends"", but i can tell that he's not okay with the situation, even despite he's trying not to show me that. I know i fucked up big time. He's my best friend that has always been there for me and i won't forgive myself if i'll lose him. So, reddit, what do i do? I know it would be the best just to tell about the situation, but i can't find proper words and it pains me. Thanks in advance."
ff,"Am I being a bad friend or is she?
Hey, I'm kind of new to Reddit but I kinda need an opinion on a situation and I really hope the person I'm talking about never reads this. 

I have this close friend, (let's call her P) and lately, P and I have been having some problems. 

P is annoyed because she thinks I don't spend enough time with her. She's in one of my classes so I see her every other day for 2 hours but that isn't enough for her and she wants me dedicate my lunch time to her and spend more time texting her. She gets upset about this to the point where she sends me accusatory/passive aggressive texts during lunch about my location. Now keep in mind, I'm an honors student and I usually have club meetings or classwork to do during lunch periods and I barely see my other friends, who I'm much closer to and don't share many classes with, because of this.  
I'd be happy to spend time with her in a group of my friends (who she's also friends with) and spend time everyone but she gets mad or upset when I try to talk to my best friends.
Also, I don't really like her personality sometimes. She's kind of vain and she flirts with my friends and she likes a lot of guys for simple reasons (i.e. this one guy who's really friendly waves at her every time he sees her in the halls and she had a crush on him for two months because of that even though he wasn't interested). And she always talks about herself and gets jealous of my friendship with the waving guy she liked, to the point where I've stopped talked to him so she doesn't tell me about her dreams in which I make out with the guy in front of her and make her really jealous. 
However, she cut off most of her ties with her former friend group because they talked behind her back about how she only talks about herself and the current guy she has a crush on. 
I understand her situation and that she feels like she's losing her only friend but I really don't like being controlled and walked on.
I also feel bad about her situation and I don't want her to cry, make me look like a bad person and talk behind my back to my friends/twist the situation (which she has done before) and my friends are either telling me to cut it off with her or that I'm overreacting and a bad friend so I'm posting on here for a second, unbiased opinion. Help?"
ff,"Annoyed and I feel absolutely horrible about it
My parents have recently recovered from some financial issues that caused them to move out of state. A little over a year ago, my father found a job back in the state where I currently live and has been staying at my place during the weeks when he works. As much as I love my parents though, sometimes I really struggle with sharing my limited space, i.e. a very small one bedroom apartment. 

What makes it even more difficult is the fact that I rarely ever know ahead of time when he's coming and when he isn't. And when he does come, he doesn't knock. He just walks right in using the spare key that I came home to find was gone (without first being asked if it was okay to take) a while back. 

It honestly makes me feel like I'm twelve again. I worked very hard to become independent and to have my own life and space and now... I don't. I hadn't even been on my own for a year when all of this started. 

I can't say anything about it because my mother always downplays it by saying, ""You'll be fine. We're family."" And the one time I even indirectly said something to my father, just by casually asking if he'd taken my spare key, I got a phone call from my mother saying that he was upset and essentially blamed me for them having to move to begin with. 

Long story short, I don't know what to do. I feel so terrible to be annoyed with the situation, but I am."
ff,"I'm going to the party
Awhile back I was out drinking with my aunt. She decided to tell me a"" huge family secret""  that my father was murdered by the guy my mom dated after he died. And that my mom was complicit. 

That my gramma and uncle , both dead now believed this too. That some doctor at the hospital said he looked as if he had been beaten to death. 

This pissed me off and confused me greatly since  my mother can't speak up for herself. She died  7 yr's ago. 

My aunt wasn't even there when my dad died in front if all us kids and my mom from an aneurysm when I was 2. 

This explains a lot about how I always felt me and my mom were outcast by my dad's family over the years. 

Yes my mom was a hippy and my dad's family didn't approve of her since she already had 4  kids when they married.

 Yes after he died she dated one of their mutual friends, who was black which they also disapproved of. 

That night riding my bike home from the bar I was crying and so confused praying to my mom and dad why would she say this to me? 

So i called my big sister/ best friend who calmed me down saying no, she was there, he wasn't murdered, my aunt just talking shit. 

My aunt  called me next day asking me not to tell my siblings what she said. She said she was afraid  the suspected murderer might come after her?! 

 Anyway by that time it was too late , but i didn't tell her that. I promised not to tell. I shouldn't have lied but the whole thing was just so bizarre I couldn't keep it to myself. 

My brother messaged her on FB that she was wrong, that he was there and saw everything , my dad was not murdered. 

The fact she would say that about my mom really upset all of us. 

Well since my brother messaged her, my aunt and my cousins completely ghosted me and my kids over the holidays and everything. 

Before then we were close travelling together and going to events and parties all the time. My kids don't get it. Where is auntie they say , can we go visit? I just say she's busy.

So yesterday my cousins ex posted about a birthday party for her 3 yo son. I msgs her me and my 4 and 7 yo would like to go. She said sure sorry she forgot to invite us. 

So now I'm about to go and see all of them for the first time since all the bs. Im nervous but I know it's the right thing to do. Give me strength mom and dad!"
ff,"Trying to make me jealous
I once asked some friends about where they get one of their ""items"" and they both seemed to shrug it off, laugh and basically show that they don't want me to know. I thought wow ok didn't expect it from friends but I guess some people are petty about some things. And they knew that it got to me a little that they didn't tell me but whatever. Now they would bring up the topic of this ""item"" here and there knowing how they treated me regarding it. I have strong suspicions they are doing it to spite me or prod me to give a reaction or just to reinforce their ""dominant"" position. They probably get a kick out of it. The problem is, I don't know the best way to react to it when it's brought up in convo to show that I'm not envious or jealous. And I'm not jealous of it at all as I actually found out what I needed to through other means, it just bugs me that they think it does and so I don't want to give off that vibe so they can go into a private convo and laugh about it."
ff,"Telling my bestfriend she's long winded without hurting her feelings?
My bestfriends and I have been bestfriends for about 2 1/2 years. We met in our college choir and are still in college, just for context. When were at school we basically hang out every night and I love her but when she gets started its like she doesn't know when to stop. I've had to resort to redirecting my attention when she's been going on too long. 

She tells me the same, or similar stories a lot and has to give me all types of insignificant details that prolong her talking. Even when I bring to her attention she mentioned something before it usually never stops her from telling me again. It does get kinda awkward when I have to ignore her but it hasn't stopped her from rambling. I just don't want to hurt her feelings because I know she talks to me because I'm one of the few people she feels this open to drain everything into. Any advice?"
ff,"How do I end this, or can I fix it?
ok, so it's kinda a long story.. but me and my best friend met in high school, we clicked right away, there was this bond ( and kinda still is? ) between us, we would never separate, always talking etc. Still in highschool she cut me out of her life sudendly for a whole year. I dont know why I continue trying to talk to her, but maybe it would have been better for us if it had end there, and eventually she came around and asked to go out with her, we didnt talk at all about that, she just gave me a note saying why she did that, wich honestly didnt tell much except saying she has depression and didnt know what she was doing...She said she always hurts everyone so she cut me out. Years later, we didnt talk that much as before, but were still really good friends, then I started to notice that me or other friends counldn say anything to her if it was something that upset her. Sometimes it was so stupid that she got mad at me because I didnt agree with her opinion over an actor... She would rage in games with everyone, and stop talking.. now the part that hurts me like hell is that she would cut us all out of her life, for like weeks, then come back like nothing happen. She would never tell me whats wrong, if I tried to talk about more serious stuff she would step away again. Eventually I got tired, and told her that we couldnt go on like this.
 
So I stoped talking to her, 2 months later I decided to give another shot, what happen was exactly the same. So I stoped talking again, and I though it was for good, we only talked when we were with all our friends etc. Then I learnt a few months later that she wanted to commit suicide. She actually tried it, said her mom, and was admited to an hospital. I was heart broken, thinking about losing her forever took over my jugdment... So I went to the hospital, and we talk normally. Then after she got out we had a conversation, face to face, about her stoping doing all that to me, she said she was going to try, and promised me, PROMISED ME that she would tell me when something was wrong, or when she would like to be left alone so I didnt worry as much, and that she would talk to me if I ever said something wrong about her. Everything was going great, amazing really. I could tell she was better with her medicine and all, but that only last 3 months. Now she had a problem with a boy she likes or something, pretended that everything was ok, despited her answers said otherwise, and started ignoring me. I was mad and said, some things never change, and she responded to me saying she was a lost cause. I wrote a whole text to her saying I want to be her friend, but that will only work as long as shes honest with me and stops pushing me away... she wanst answered yet. she also never said to me that shes sorry she hurts me, even thoug I say that to her when I hurt her. I feel like Im in a toxic relationship, that I always find my way back in again. Is there a way to fix this? or should I just give up for good?"
ff,Friend has crossed the line...
ff,"Help...Relationship with my depressed, mentally messed up friend
This is my first time posting on reddit, sorry if I have made any mistakes.

This post is gonna be quite long. To start with, my friend and I are both 15 year olds living in Hong Kong and we study in the same school. She is a great person, very special, someone I can never forget. The problem is that she is the kind of person who smiles in front of people but is actually depressed. And I feel like I will just make things worse.

Because of her laughs and near-crazy actions, nobody knows her true feelings. In fact she constantly complains about everything, being unpopular, being immature, the education system here, her online friends, just to mention a few. She is tired and feels like a loser all the time. Games and cosplaying is the only way she escapes from reality. I don't mind listening to rants. It's ok to be sad. But I seriously do not know how to respond when she comes up with questions related to suicide.

During lessons my friend would show me long paragraphs about her self hate and ask for my reply. A typical example of our conversation: ""Why am I so unpopular?"" ""..."" ""WHY AM I SO UNPOPULAR."" ""...maybe you have different hobbies and interests from most people?"" Then she starts to regret her choices, why did she choose to study in this school, if she had been in another school, she would have been happier... etc.

In her letters, she questioned about the meaning of life. She wrote about ""nightmares"", ""thought crimes"" and ""leaving the endless circle of life"". That left me terrified. All I could do is to sit next to her speechless. If I said something wrong she would just jump off from the roof. Not to mention all those confusing philosophical questions. I can never give an answer simply because I don't know how.
I once asked the school social workers how to talk to a depressed friend. Her advice was literally trash, and I ended up crying when I talked about her suicidal thoughts. I have no idea what to do. The next day when you see her at the school gates, she puts on that smile again, but she definitely has problems.

Anyone has experience in dealing with such friends? Depressed friends who smiles all the time? It sounds weird to ask what I can do for you, because she normally won't respond (at least I think so). What should I (or should not) say to her?"
ff,"I'm a [M/17] A guy and I both know each other but never spoke a word, how can I approach him.
Before telling you about my problem that I seek advice for, let me tell you about my personality. I don't have any real friends, I just have acquaintances, if you will, people who I see in school mostly and spend some time with occasionally, I find myself to be happier this way since I could focus more on what I like most (Science and music) I basically spend a vast majority of my time alone even when I go out to the cinema or to get dinner I have no one but myself, I was like this since I was a kid, so due to this my social skills aren't great, I turn red most of the times when I speak to new people and just wish I'd turn into a tree just so I could escape the situation. However, I can speak on a stage in front of thousands of people if I had to, as long as it is not a direct interaction or I already know the people I'm speaking with, I am good.

With that said, over the past year, I found myself trapped in a social situation beyond my understanding, I genuinely don't fully understand how this relationship (If you could call it that in the first place) developed in the first place but here is a recap of what happened. A little bit over a year ago in my school. Some guy and I sat around the same table in the library, this happened because the library was packed that day and there was no other place other than that table, so we just sat opposite to eachother not saying a word, and I'm pretty sure each one of us didnt know that the other existed in the first place, days went by and everyday I went to the library I'd sit in the same place and the same goes for him, even when the library was completely empty we'd sit in the exact same place, by this time we knew eachother but never spoke a single word I guess we got used to eachother and if a day went by without one of us being there I'm pretty sure we'd feel a bit blue. By the time we were done with our exams we stopped coming to the library and did not see each other that often until our classes got moved and my homeroom happened to be just opposite of his, and this is where the bollocks started, we got to see one another way more often, In the corridor, the bathroom, on the way out to the buses, and as we passed by eachother, we'd always just stare at eachother still not speaking a single word, we both know eachother but pretended that we didn't. We would find our selves in group conversations since we have mutual friends, we still wouldn't directly speak but if I say a joke he's going to laugh and vice versa. I developed some kind of liking for this guy, I almost consider him to be a friend although we never spoke, I'd like to say hi, but as I said before I will probably turn so red that I'd melt, and even if I was courageous enough and had the social skills to do so I don't even know if he wants to talk maybe he doesn't like me or consider me a friend, maybe I'm just an obnoxious kid he sees way too often. Now we see each other every day in the morning, I don't know how the hell it happens but we go to the restroom at the same exact time in the morning (I guess we both arrive at the same time). So this is a short version of what happened, this is bugging me and I've been losing sleep over it, what do I do?

Sorry for the long post and rubbish grammar (English isn't my first language) Thanks in advance."
ff,"Suppose you also have a teenage daughter
My daughter is quite often seen on the phone with her friend since she has her first smartphone. She get used to locking her bedroom when she is out. More often than before she gets home late. I don't know whether she slips out at night when we all sleep.
I'm concerned about her. What I only want is to keep her away from the bad influence. What can I do?"
ff,"Should my friend pay for the damage she caused to my car?
I asked my friend to drive my car and pick me and some of our other friends up from a party. She drove about 7 miles, 15 mins, with the parking brakes on. I took it to the shop the next day and they said I would be fine for now, but I would need to repair the damage within a month. They said it would be $250. 
If it was me I would've offered to pay 100% right away.
Should I ask her to pay? Should I get her insurance involved?
We're both college students and she doesn't have a job. I don't want to ruin the friendship, but I'm already super upset about the damage to my car and feel that she should take responsibility for this.
What should I do??"
ff,"My Friend is Draining Me
Apologies, this is a very long post!

I’ve been good friends with a girl for around 10 years since we were teenagers. She moved overseas around 5 years ago. She used to be such a fun, bubbly and funny person until she met her boyfriend around 3 years ago. Looking back, I can see that she was a always bit crazy and insecure (her father is emotionally abusive and tells her she’s worthless and stupid), but meeting him seems to have exacerbated all her bad qualities. She has a really low self esteem and perception issues when it comes to relationships. She also has OCD.

She was, and still is OBSESSED with her now ex boyfriend. They had an on off relationship where she thought it was normal to call him “just ten times” in one day, and would get upset and not be able  “sleep or eat” if he doesn’t reply, thinks talking on the phone three times a day is not much, they pushed and shoved each other, she hit him, he talked to other girls and acted like she wasn’t his girlfriend, she’d call his voicemail just to hear his voice, he threatened to hurt her, she considered going to a shitty college just to be near him, etc.. basically an abusive and obsessive relationship with awful communication.

Every time she messages me, she’ll ask how I am and ask a few questions, and then steer the conversation back to her numerous problems and her ex. About how she’s so poor (goes out every second night and goes on shopping sprees), how she’s really sad (but won’t see a counselor because she’s “too poor”), how she wants to be confident and independent (goes back to the ex repeatedly and doesn’t listen to any of the advice I give her), tells me she can’t eat or sleep because she’s heartbroken (I told her I was eventually okay after I broke up with an ex, but she brushed it off as I hadn’t gone out with him for as long and how she gave everything to her ex). She also says how I’m so lucky to live with my boyfriend and how I have such an amazing life, as if she’s the only person in the world that has problems.

I’ve talked to her multiple times about how talking about her ex all the time and her problems is effecting me (as well as her other friends), and how she should really see a professional as this behavior is really hurting her. She always apologizes and says that she didn’t realize how it might make me annoyed, and she’ll send me an inspirational video or inspirational words, and asking about me before going back to changing the topic so she can talk about herself, her ex and how it’s so hard for her right now, how she feels suffocated and her heart is broken. I understand that people go through hard times in their lives, but this has lasted at least 3 years. I’ve always said how I’ll be there for her and that if she needs to talk to someone, I’ll listen, but I’m starting to feel that this is a one way relationship.

The frustrating thing is that she says she agrees to everything I say, and how’s shes going to change, but nothing has changed! She says she’s more confident and doing this and that to help herself, but she just plasters selfies and videos of herself going out with people to try and convince people that she’s having an amazing time. 

I don’t want to just ignore her, but I don’t think talking to her again will do anything. I’ve been nice, brutally honest, and even angry at her and nothing has changed. She’s stuck in her own tragic world and I’m realizing that maybe she thrives in this drama, and that she’s lonely and needs a boyfriend’s attention to validate her self worth . Our other mutual friend has cut ties with her due to this. I think I have put up with this for so long as we’re not living in the same country.. 

Sorry about the long rant and formatting, I’m on my cellphone.

TL;DR friend who lives overseas is emotionally draining me every time I talk to her. I have already talked to her about it multiple times, but she always goes back to her old ways."
ff,"I think my friends ditched me.
I was recently doing a mass unfollowing on Instagram and I noticed a lot of people that I went to high school and college with are no longer following me. Same thing with Facebook. I don’t blame them because I’m boring and they are either married with kids or they’re just out to the hottest bar or club every damn weekend. I don’t drink nor am I in a relationship or married. Where does a 29 year old go to make new friends and even find the love of their life? I failed to find her in school or work. Am I just doomed to roam the planet a loner who only can have internet friends. Sure it’s cool at first but I need real friends to talk to and someone to marry for real.

I just cant stand them anymore. They treat me like a shit compared to my sister. I never ask my parents for money I eat at home so they don't give me money for lunch I don't buy things I'm using old phone that i bought 6 years ago with my own money. But my mother changed 3 phones in the last year. They threat my sister a lot better they gifted her a phone for christmas i got some shitty speakers that had the price tag on and believe me their price was not close to the phone's. They bought her a new car last year they gave her the money for the driving lessons and she want money from them everyday. So i need a new PC at the moment so i thought that i might ask them because i really need it and that's the only thing i have ever ask my parents for my I haven't asked for a single cent in my whole life. Everything i buy i buy with my saved money from grandparents. I even buy my studentbooks with my own money. And they refused. They told me if i have the money to buy it but I spent all i had to buy furniture for my room if i didn't i would've gotten only a bed in my room. I feel hated. They don't spend time with me neither give me money. Yesterday I offered them to give me the money for the PC and when i have the money i will return them but they still said no. I legit have no idea why they do it. I don't go out often i don't argue with them  and i have decent grades in school. They are so unfair."
ff,"How do I show my family that I love them?
I am 23. I consider myself am emotinally distant person and I like to spend most of my time alone with my dog.

I was watching the road movie and at the end i just started balling my eyes out for 30 mins +. 

In a couple of months I'll  finish my degree and plan to move abroad. I guess the thought of losing my parents and my dog hit me hard. I will still get to see them of course but I think I started crying at the thought of losing them permanently. 

Somehow my dog realized I was sad and came up to cuddle and put his leg on my arm as of to make me feel better (he hates cuddling)

I never told my parents I love them and i don't  think I have it in me to say it I don't  know why. I want to show them. I am think of writing a letter to each of them and saying it in that.

Any ideas? I'm  very distant and and that's why I never been in a long term relashionship"

I am very close with 3 girls and I’ve noticed if definitely the duff(desensitize ugly fat friend). Which I  guess is fine but it’s just that my two friends have boy friends and that all they talk about. There going to a volleyball game and didn’t even tell me (we literally tell each other everything). And I was like I’ll go with another girl and they didn’t even want me to go. Anyways they just have such perfect life’s school, popularly, money, And there  beautiful.  And like much more. And I’m over here with a horrible life compared to them my family sucks and like if I got into details you would understand I have no friends except them  my family is broke and I’m so ugly and I suck at school. I know thing will get better bc I’m only in 8th grade but it’s just so hard to be friends with these amazing girls when your constantly comparing yourself and lowering your self esteem.

ff,"Kids- I don’t want them...is it likely I will change my mind in the future
Hey all! I have felt very strongly that I don’t want children for many years now. I don’t think there is anything wrong with me not wanting kids. And I don’t think there is anything wrong with people that do want kids. I’ve been wondering how likely it is that I might want kids in the future. 

Has anyone not wanted kids when they were in their early twenties and then had a change of mind/heart? Just curious! Btw I’m 25 years old."
ff,"I can't forgive her, no matter how hard I try
I'm focusing on improving myself and working through repressed emotions from a difficult upbringing, namely with my grandmother. I am currently staying with her but thankfully I am already making plans and taking steps to move out within the next 5 months or so. I have stayed on and off the last several years and before I became an adult, I lived with her from birth.

We have a complicated relationship. Although I appreciate the things she has done for me - and she often tries to make me happy by buying me something or getting me food I like, etc. - I can't seem to let go of the deep seated anger and resentment I feel toward her for the mistakes she has made and how she has also been cruel to me.

I understand no one is perfect; adults aren't always ideal role models to kids. But my grandmother had a unique way of mentally and emotionally hurting me as a child. She would often act like I was her partner in crime [in the absence of a husband] and made me feel responsible for her happiness. She would try to talk bad about my mom so I wouldn't favor her [my mom wasn't living with us and had mental issues]. She would give me the cold shoulder, or say things to incite anxiety and guilt in me if I happened to act like I wanted to spend more time with my mom or got in a bad mood. 

It confuses me because I think deep in my heart I DO want a happy relationship with her...or maybe I try so hard out of guilt, knowing she has tried to make it up to me, I guess? But every so often I implode and I tell her how much she bothers me or even that I hate her. Sometimes even hearing the sound of her voice is enough to make me want to scream in irritation. I feel terrible about it and like I'm a monster. I always feel guilty when she tells me 'you're the only one who is really special to me, you're the only one I have.' [She doesn't have a close relationship with mom, her other D, or siblings.] Maybe I get angry because to me, this doesn't feel normal, it feels like I'm being trapped. 

I'm seeing a DBT therapist but we aren't making progress about this ... yet. I just wish this was not my life. I'm not looking for solutions per say, just sympathy or someone who also understands. It's so exhausting."
ff,"Friend leads much better life, I feel resentful
We both just graduated, she had so many job offers,  I had none save for an internship. I found a job later but I make less than half of what she makes. She got a job offer from another firm, and referred me to them when she turned them down, but I didn't get it even though the interview went great. And because she makes so much more than I do, she's always trying to get me to travel, which I can't afford since I'm saving up for grad school.  She's also currently in a relationship, and has tried to set me up with people but it never works. 

She's a great friend but she makes me feel so inadequate. I'm begining to become resentful and envious, and I don't want to be a toxic person to be around. It's getting hard for me to hear about her achievements while I have nothing to compare, how shitty of a person would I be if I distanced myself from her for my own mental well-being?"

ff,"How I Learned About My Birthfather... & My Brother?
I remember when I was around 11, my little cousin, Lily, who was 6, came from Cuba to the U.S. with her parents. They stayed in our home for a few months until they were able to find a place. 

Right before they left for their new home; I was on my computer, I was 12, playing educational computer games. My family is chattering/gossiping in the living room per usual. I never had any interest in the family gossip, I just wanted to be in my own little space/world. Lily was not like that at all, she loved to listen-in on family drama. It was not long until Lily came barging into the room saying:    
""I know a secret.""    
""What?""    
""Roberto isn't your real dad.""    
""Liar.""    
""I'm not lying, they're talking about it!""    
""I don't believe you, so just leave me alone.""    
""Just ask your mom.""

After that she left the room and the seed of doubt was planted in my head. I did not think twice of it at that moment. It sure as hell bothered the hell out of me for days.. then weeks.. and eventually to months, to almost a year.

It wasn't long after, I started to doubt it myself. I did not really look like my father, Roberto. He was light-medium brown skin color, I had pale skin with freckles. My mother had a light tan. Things that I did not notice before started to bother me. The difference in skin color, I did not have his last name, there were not baby pictures of him holding me. I did not feel a connection to this man. I was 13, almost 14, when I decided to confront my mom about it while she was organizing important documents. There was something about this that was bugged me was that... I KNEW the answer to her question BEFORE she could respond. I was 99.9% sure already, but I still had that 0.1% in order to fully believe it.    
""Mom, can I ask you something?""    
""What?""    
""Is Roberto my real dad?""    
""No.""    
""Who is?""    
""I can't talk right now, I'm busy.""    

It was at that moment that I knew she did not really care to talk about it. Of course, I would bring it up again and she would brush it off just the same. ""I'm busy,"" or ""Not right now."" After a while, I stopped communicating with my mother and our relationship has suffered, to this day, because of it. It was not long after my mother asked for a divorce to my step-father. I remember her sitting me down on the couch and talking to me through it. I did not have a strong relationship with Roberto to begin with, it hurt to an extent, but it was not something that I felt devastated over. She did end up telling me that she married Roberto to provide me a father figure.  

On my 14th birthday, Roberto tells my mother and aunt that we need to leave the house permanently. The day after my birthday, we packed up our things the same day and left. All of this happened one week before school started, I was going to start high school. It was hard for the first few months, and around that time I started to get more curious about my birthfather as Roberto was separating himself from the picture. So I began to research him, ask my mother (always backfires on me), and listening to family gossip. One of the few things I caught was that my mother came into the U.S. legally, unknowingly pregnant. When she began to go see the doctors for a check-up, that is when she found out she was pregnant. Got married to my step-father, Roberto, when I was 2yrs, and from there I believed he was my father all along up until I asked her.

On April 20th, 2017 I received a random friend request on Facebook. The last name was exactly like my last name and strangely enough, looking at this guy's profile picture, he looked a lot like me -- strange. It took me a few days of speculation to finally grow the balls to accept the friend request after 6 days, April 25th.    
""May I ask who you are? And do you have any relationship to Alexander?""    
""I am his son. From what I see, you're my sister.""    
From there he asked for my phone number. I was still skeptical and asked for details such as my birthfather's birthday and my mother's name to prove it. Once it was proven, I gave him me information. I found out I had a little brother in Cuba, he turned just 19 this year in January. My birthfather and his family were in Cuba. My brother 3½ yrs younger than me. It is absolutely crazy thinking how I was raised as an only child, while he was raised knowing I existed somewhere in the world. I still have trouble wrapping my head around this.

I video chatted with my birthfather, Alexander, and brother, Lazaro, for hours. My father was crying. I did not get the full details on HOW they found me, it was hard to understand -- the Internet connection was extremely bad and it costs a lot of money to communicate from Cuba to the United States. I saw my grandparents for the first time. My grandfather was crying on the webcam and my grandmother was crying as well. They looked so happy and kept telling me that they prayed to God every day to just see me and that I was happy/healthy. We all laughed, we cried, we smiled. It was bittersweet. We asking questions and answering them through smiles, tears, and laughter. 

Unfortunately, a lot of time has passed, and that would be the first and only time I would have seen my grandmother. She died unexpectedly on December 24th, 2017. (R.I.P. Abuela Ramona) 

Hopefully, I can make a trip out to Cuba this year so that I can meet my family. My mother will not be joining me on my trip as she does not want to be part of that. I am not mad at my mother, I am just disappointed in the way she kept such a secret from me. I do not trust her on the same level as I did prior to all of it. My hands are shaking as I write all of this down. I am still trying to wrap my head around it. It is 2018 now and I will be planning a trip this summer to see them hopefully. The realization is hitting me that I am anxious beyond belief. I felt as though I babbled a little too much, but I needed to get this all out. This was therapeutic for me. I am going to sleep now, good night ladies and gentlemen. Sleep well.

I will be making a new post about meeting them. Thank you for reading."

ff,"Help - unplanned pregnancy at 41, wife wants to keep it
Hello, I need some real advice.

My wife and I were married in 2011. We dated four years and the day we married was the best day of my life. We immediately became pregnant with our daughter, who is now 5. A couple of years later we welcomed our son (now almost 3).  

Brief introduction of us - I'm almost 41 and she almost 37. I work full time and she recently became a stay at home mom.  We are middle class, homeowners living in Seattle, college degrees, financially responsible, socially liberal on most issues, have good friend circle (many with similar aged children), good family support live in area. Both of us raised in healthy and happy traditional nuclear homes. Our traditional marriage is good and based on trust, but I won't lie and say the last 5 years of raising two children hasn't been without its challenges and occasional spat. But we married for life, and at the altar when I said I do forever, I meant it. Overall, we are fortunate and thankful for our lives.

After the birth of our second child, I was done.  I had considered getting a vasectomy (snipped). Many of my dad friends had done it and recommended I do it. My wife was against it, and I wasn't really wanting to do it either for other reasons.

My wife always semi-joked she wanted another kid, and had quipped she felt incomplete and that being a mother is her calling.  She is an excellent, patient mother to our children.  However, I felt it was a phase and she could get her ""baby fix"" with friends newborns.  I did not feel a need to have another child, and was quite against it. I was frank with her on the matter, but because of the differing opinion and emotional confrontation, we avoided discussing it at length.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago when my wife informs me she missed her period and sure she is pregnant. No visits to the doctor yet to confirm, but we have never had problems conceiving, and I believe she is pregnant.  Our birth control was her counting her monthly cycle, which she is pretty good at.  I always reached for a condom just in case, but she does not like using them and told me it was not needed. Well we slipped one past the goalie.  

When she told me, I reacted poorly, saying it would mess up the good thing we had going, I was tired and didn't have the energy, our family was complete already.  Not to mention the fact that it was be financially very difficult (we'd have to buy a larger house and I don't need to tell you what Seattle real estate is like). We are quite squeezed in our little home already. I told her she would have to go back to work. I asked her to terminate the pregnancy. To sum it up, it wasn't the reaction she was hoping to hear.

The next week I bounced between many emotions. Anger, for upsetting our lives, even considering the idea she intentionally got pregnant. Fear, that our stable little family might crumble, that 3 makes an odd man out and the children would suffer. Fear, that she isn't healthy for this, as she is showing some physical ailments/breakdown that shouldn't be ignored and having another child will only fixing those off further. Fear, that I'm suffering physical ailments as well and don't have the energy to go through another round of caring for an infant. Fear, that both her parents and mine are elderly and close to needing care from us, and that they won't be there to be the ""relief valve"" and help with watching the kids when we need it. Anxiousness, that we had just got out of having the kids in diapers and were just starting the ""next phase"" of our children being autonomous and doing activities I could participate in. Guilt, for crushing her dreams and not supporting the idea of a third child when its something she wants very badly. 

One day I wrote out an objective list of reasons (many of which are cited above) why having a third child was a bad idea. After a few more days of trying to ignore the issue, we had our blowup.  I presented her my list and she listened, acknowledging they were valid and made sense. She then countered with her belief that this was meant to be, and she could not in good conscious have an abortion. It would stay with her forever and she says she would never get over it, and would forever resent me for pushing the issue.  I told her I might resent the child and her for letting this happen.   I slept on the couch that night, feeling disgust and bitterness.

The next morning there was nothing else to do but discuss it more. I again said I wasn't interested, and she can't force this on me. She again countered with her same argument that it was meant to be, that our ""next phase"" of children would just have to wait a few more years.  I yelled I would be almost 60 years old at this child's high school graduation. I want to play sports with my kids and be active, not the ""old dad"". I said I wouldn't care, not even over the name we would give it. I said I wound't go with her to the doctor appointment.  I told her she was being selfish and not putting what she has now over what she might have. She told me she would start contacting a divorce lawyer if this was how it was going to be.

It's only been a few days since that talk, but I am completely stunned and not myself.  I was a zombie at work, not able to focus on anything. At home I've been short tempered and avoiding everything.  I've cried in my car, cried in the bathroom. Borderline panic attacks.  I'm frantically researching mental health professionals, as I need to talk to someone. I haven't seen a counselor since before we were married.  I can't talk to my family or friends until the doctor visit to confirm the pregnancy.  I feel like an absolute asshole for saying the things I said and my attitude, and I can't take that back. Even if it isn't a viable pregnancy, or she miscarries, I've made my mark and she will always think less of me. I'm scared she regrets even having ever met me.  I absolutely DO NOT want to break up our family, I love my children and family. I am certain a divorce would ruin all of us.  

We are at an absolute impasse. She is set in her mind, the only thing that could stop this is the doctor saying she or the baby are not healthy and viable. 

I'm beside myself. It's not that I don't love children, I really do. And I know I'll still love the child regardless, it's not the child's fault and they should not be treated unfairly. And she may be right, that it is only raising another baby is temporary and it'll pass and everything will be OK and we will all be happier. But what if it's not? What if this was a bad idea and our quality of life is destroyed? What if I do resent her, or she resents me because of my opinion. What if her feeling of being ""incomplete"" is just a phase and she really just misses doting on a newborn. What if that feeling doesn't go away after a third child? Am I the selfish one? Are my doubts unreasonable?  What can I do?"
ff,"help with friends/roommate situation
I have been trying to be friends with my roommate for months, but recently noticed she uses me. I always invite her to hang out, I do all the cleaning, I bake her food, do sweet things, helped her when shes throwing up, taken care of her, and overall have been called an amazing roommate by others. She's never once said thank you or has reciprocated, and my mother and a friend called it into my attention. I was fine with it (sort of), but I really wish she would have maybe wanted to be friends. But like I said, its fine you can't force people to care back. My problem arose when I introduced her to my bestest friends because she was sad and lonely and heading down a road I was very familiar with and didn't want her to go through, and she proceeded to ""Steal"" my bestest friends. I only say the world steal because she doesn't try to be friends with me and talks behind my back with them and has thoroughly excluded me from my own friend group. I'm just so angry and can't talk to her, she has permanently damaged my friendships because she literally always hangs out with them now, and has just kind of shoved me to a curb. I find it extremely inconsiderate because this year has been really rough for me because I was lowkey depressed for medical reasons and a tough break up, and she knew I was lonely and super super happy when I made my supposed close friends. She is so fake with them, it doesn't make sense. For example, one of my friends was going through a rough time and I was helping him get through it, and my roommate tried to butt in and help him too after meeting him like once. Yes, reader you are probably thinking to yourself, what's wrong with wanting to help people? And I would agree with you, there isn't anything wrong. But the thing is that she lacks consistency. She only tries to help when it is beneficial to her. Helping people is not in her personality, I spent months and months sobbing and upset and she would just run away and turn a blind eye. Why care about my friend who I had taken the time to bond with and gained trust with? She literally had met him like twice?! I think I forgot to mention that we are both female and all my friends are male and she didn't have any male friends before this and she was upset and lonely because of an ex...sounds sketchy af to me.... Point is, I haven't talked to her in two weeks, I just can't hang with my friends anymore, and everyone thinks I'm the bad guy. I myself don't know if I am the bad guy, my close friends from home think I have a right to be upset..am I the bad guy for being upset? What should I even do at this point? 
Some people told me I needed to find better friends since they don't take my feelings into consideration, but I don't want to be that bitch that is like you have to choose friends...I'm conflicted with that because loyalty in friendship is very important..idk please help I'm just so sad and mad"
ff,"Am I being paranoid?
I joined Girl Crew a few months ago. For those who don't know, it's basically an app for women to make friends. A few of us girls met up twice and have a group chat. We're planning to go to a rally tomorrow, and we all expressed our interest in getting a drink afterwards. Two of the girls tagged/mentioned the others in the group in something on FB - places to go for drinks. Both times I was not mentioned, despite saying that I'd like to go. So, am I being paranoid? Or do I have a right to be upset? Rationally, I shouldn't be. We don't know each other that well, so they can't hate me yet. But I don't know. I didn't make the best first impression, so maybe they don't want to be near me at all. I might not even go tomorrow; I might remove myself from the group chat/delete them off FB. What should I do?"

ff,"Was it wrong to block my dad's phone?
Was it wrong of me to block my dad? We had a massive fight that just escalated quickly, as we always do. My dad has a habit to threaten to disown me every time he gets angry. Once I pointed out how hurtful it was, and asked him to please not to say that, but nothing changed. So I’m just trying not to respond to these angry text messages about how he wanted me to stop using their address because we are not family anymore. 20 minutes later he sends another message telling me to do as he says or he will embarrass me in an extended family group chat (he doesn’t know that it doesn’t bother me and he eventually carries out this threat later), and then 20 minutes later he offers me a deal where he would drop this address issue if I do a couple of things that he wanted. Sorry for being vague, the things he wanted were the things I essentially didn’t want to do and is linked to what we had an argument about. From my perspective, I saw messages that were intentionally hurtful, about how I wasn’t family, and then I saw a threat to shame me, and then I saw what looks like a way to manipulate or coerce me into doing what he wanted. It was very late at night and I had work the next day. That was the point I blocked his number (and I told him before I blocked it) and it is the first time ever in all 30 years of my life. However, now I’m wondering if it was the right thing to do, because well, Asian parents always say shit like that and don’t mean it, and I think my very drastic step would have upset both my parents a lot. An imposed silence also sabotages the opportunity for future open communication and is quite passive aggressive as well. If they were overreacting about the disowning me part, then I could have angered them to the point where they decide to go through with it.

The next two days I unblocked my dad and sent some messages about how I was sorry I had to block my dad and clarified some of the things they were unhappy about (some of what they were unhappy about wasn't at all true). But I think both my parents have now blocked my number. Yet I can't blame them for doing that because I did it to them first, but I do wish I had just turned off my mobile, or been able to bear the burden of hearing shitty talk, instead of blocking my dad. (It's not possible to visit them as we live in different countries).  

Prior to this fight, I have been working through ‘abandonment’ issues with a therapist. Not hard to understand why… my dad always says things like ‘don’t call me dad’ and ‘don’t come home’, ‘don’t need a daughter like that’ if I don’t do what he says for as long as I can remember. My parents don't know this. I’ve thought about completely cutting my dad out of my life, but I’m undecided as I feel like other people who have done it have more serious issues like abuse, violence, lying, and more about conflicts on serious issues like marriage, religion, sexual identity and child custody.

Would really appreciate some 'Asian' perspective here, as most of my friends don't fully understand the cultural aspect of this."
ff,"Friend Abandonment Issues
Hey Reddit. Im having some friend issues. I(M33) have a friend(M34) who I was close with for years who now seems to abandoning me. We met each other 10 years ago. We hit it off and would casually hang out with eachother. He was new to the city so I ushered him into the fold of my friend group.We both had similar tastes and sense of humor. It would work out good and we would have a great time. After a couple years he totally cut off contact with me and those friends. I was confused but didn't mind so much then because I wasn't super close with him. I was confused but not hurt. A couple years after that I reached out to a bunch of people because I needed help moving. I was pretty desperate and couldn't afford movers so I reached out to him as well. To my surprise he responded and came and helped. I was so happy he offered to help and was happy to see him again. After that, we started hanging out again. I asked him what happened and why he broke off contact and he shared with me things about being depressed and hanging out with other people. It felt I little strange but I accepted it and carried on being his friend again. We both moved to a 'big city' through our jobs and work and would meet lots of different people and introduce each other to new friends. We would periodically check in with each other and see how each other are doing, even if we couldn't hang out for weeks on end. We were in a band for a while, threw parties and events. We both went through break ups with our long time partners at different times, and helped each other out in that regard. We basically became 'close friends' and expressed this to each other. Then I introduced him to a group of old friends of mine who recently moved into the city. They all began to hang out with him and it was all good. He even hooked up with one of those friends and have been together for years. I too found a partner I have been with for a a couple years now.
Now, over the past couple years he has began to hang out with all of those friends and much less of me. He hardly ever reaches out to catch up or hang out. Months will go by. I try to reach out and stay in touch with him but he does not reciprocate. I had been dealing with this over the past couple years now. I finally called him that I feel a little hurt and that it feels like he doesn't reach out or try to stay in touch- or care for that matter. His response is ""I'm just too busy"" sort of answer. I can also see on social media that he does hang out with other people- mostly the friends I've introduced him to. I feel really hurt by this. I don't understand why he all the sudden doesn't seem to care about me. I don't feel like I have any good friends I can go to anymore. Other close friends have done the same. I have had other friends that I became pretty close with who later I feel like started to treat me like they were 'too cool' to hang out with me anymore. I start to feel less respected and cared about. I'll ask them about things they're doing in their lives and won't be asked the same questions in return. When I do put forward information about things is my life I feel like they're less and less taken seriously or completely indifferent to it.
Here's the other thing that confuses me: Some of these friends years later come out of the blue- if I run into them or they start commenting a ton on fb post and act like nothing happened and sometimes they are eager to hang out again. It makes me feel like all the sudden I've done something cool enough, or are hanging out with people they are interested in and want to join in. I don't know whether to ignore them or try to let things go and be friends. My fear is that if I do, we may become close again and they will just do the same thing.
Im very confused why this happens. I don't know if I'm doing something to encourage this. When I say 'close friend' I do not mean calling every day or even every week and sharing every aspect of each other lives. Close friend just means some one you can talk to every once in a while, and who checks in to see how the other is doing. Is that asking for too much? I feel envious when I see how my girlfriend has couple good friends she talks to about her life and issues. I think it's healthy to have close friends other than your significant other you can do this with, I just don't understand why I can't hold close friends. Any advice would be welcomed.
As a side note: since this has happened with my 'close friend' I have tried to widen my net and reach out to other people to hang out. I am becoming extremely exhausted. At age 33 now, I feel it is so difficult to try to hang out with other people. I feel like I do all the reaching out and it's making me feel extremely bitter about friends and relationships. I understand about casual friends, networking, or friends that are united around similar interests. I just get frustrated when that is the only thing that holds people together. I wonder- is that a symptom of living in a big city where everyone is trying to 'make it?' I think that, but then I'll hear about how some other casual friends keep in touch with each other still and give each other life advice etc. and just feel frustrated that I can't keep consistent good friends like that. What am I doing wrong?"

ff,"How can I deal with my clingy friend?
So, me and this girl have been friends for 5 or 6 years and I hadn't noticed any clingy behavior from her up until last year. She always wants to hang out with me everyday and if I say I don't want to she will beg me because she knows 9 times out of 10 I will cave in. I've had to come up with elaborate lies to avoid hanging out with her which has resulted in her changing her social media bios to ""friends don't lie"". I want to continue to be friends with her but I don't know how to get her to stop this behavior without hurting her feelings."
ff,"Drifting away from my best friend
My best friend and I have known each other for well over a decade, and have gone to the same schools and last year when she went away. 

We text everyday and see each other regularly but recently I’ve been feeling so disjointed from her.

We’re really close and I’ve told her things I’ve never told anyone. 

She just got into her first serious relationship, had sex for the first time, got drunk for the first time and also had her first pregnancy scare (i was with her when she took the test).  We’re 17 by the way.

However, whenever we talk it’s always about her life, and her boyfriend. She built up so much courage to dump him only to get back with him the next week. They’ve known each other for only a month and he said i love you within a week of them dating. He’s emotionally manipulative and so immature but she insists that she only tells me the bad things about him not the good things. 

I want to support her but she makes it so hard. She never asks about my life anymore. I’m going through a really tough time yet it’s never come up. All we talk about is her and her relationship. I know it’s a big part of her life but it feels like my life is just irrelevant to her.

I’ve never drank alcohol or had sex or even been in a relationship so it feels like we’re just drifting apart. I don’t relate to her anymore. 

Obviously I love her loads but it feels like this friendship is one sided and purely based on her. 

I don’t know whether to keep putting effort into this friendship or not?

ff,"Dealing with a spiteful sister-in-law?
I'm 28, and we are all living under the same roof. I live with my mom and dad, and help take care of my grandparents.. I have fibromyalgia, chronic pain, migraines 4-5 times a week and have trouble getting out of bed some days. Brother (loses jobs frequently, can never keep his wife happy) she's become a very spiteful and distant person in the last 2 years. They decided to move in March of 2016 after not getting their way of getting help from my mom (who helps everyone and is the kindest and most selfless person you will ever meet). They have 3 kids, and now a fourth one on the way in May. Brother ""Dave"" and his wife gonna call her ""Vick"". Always go back and forth at one another, as he loses jobs and they both work (she's held a stable job and he hasn't), calls him lazy, P.O.S., a horrible father, our family made her the way she is now, tells her kids to ""suck it or, or stop crying"" when they get upset or hurt. She used to be the sweetest, kindest person ever. I REALLY liked this woman, and we got along great. I could never say a bad thing about her 10 years ago. Until, I came out in 2008 as gay. She was supportive or so I thought. Then wrote a long nasty letter to me after telling my mom she didn't want me holding my boyfriends hand around her kids, that she didn't want that exposed to them, etc. I called her a hypocrite and walked off, because she did all these things with her husband and more. Nothing more, nothing less.  Cause she was and I was sick of all her bull about me and her hating on the way I was. I don't say things unless something truly bothers me and I was at the last straw. 


Said she didn't support me being gay, me being with my boyfriend was wrong, she doesn't want her kids around it, etc. Anyway, little bits of this kept coming up over the last 9 years and slowly grew distant from her. Last one me being worried about her being mad at me for something, as she came in and didn't talk  to me or respond to what I had said. I said is she mad at me? To my brother. He goes I don't think so. She then yells ""I'm not mad, STOP BEING SO DRAMATIC!"" I'm like wow.. completely out of character for her. I've never done anything to her to get spoken to like this.  1 year ago -- she called my brother a piece of sh*t for the 40th time. I got tired of it, her belittling him, throwing his things, telling him that our family are horrible people for the fights we get in once every 2 months. He looked defeated, he looked the saddest I've ever seen him. I asked what was wrong, he told me. I agreed with what he had said about her letting the children use the tablets too, that it was ridiculous that she's called him something so horrible over it. I was really angry at her, disappointed with her. We had gotten into a big fight after me coming out before as well and she denied everything that happened that day. 


I whipped out my phone for this one -- so all the facts were here. Everything was caught on camera for the minute we got into it. After I go into my room, she comes and slams the door next to my room closed and says, ""You've got to me f'ing kidding me. Is he really siding with you. HELL NO!"" to my brother. I come out and say what's the problem? (My mistake, but no... no one in my family has ever said anything to this woman to keep the peace. They're afraid of her taking the grandchildren away and my mom loves them dearly and is afraid of having a bad relationship with her.) I say ""I'm tired of you calling my brother a piece of crap."" I yelled, ""Stop treating him like that, what the hell is wrong with you? Who says that to the person they love and are married to? Why do you belittle him so much when he's finally got a nice job. I can't believe anyone in this house doesn't say anything to you over the way you treat him, specially around your kids. You say we're saying bad words in front of them and you guys and making you this way, analyze yourself."" 


She tells then to ""go back to your room, get a frigging job."" Then turns to my brother and says ""do something with your brother, go back to your room!""""I say no, you don't like what I have to say (and I speak for everyone in this house cause it's true). You can go."" This sparks her sister to message me -- telling me ""Never in my life have I been so disgusted with someone. Who do you think you are filming her!? The mother of your nephew and nieces raising your voice at her telling her to get out. I'm so disgusted, get the F' outta here!"" 


Brother wouldn't defend her after that happened. She went to my mom (who's like best friends with her) -- she didn't defend her. She then split with him for 8 months (this last August) that day. Now they're back together. Saying they're going to move and haven't. Ever since then, she's just been passive aggressive. Stands in the doorway and doesn't move when I need to get through. Is constantly rude when anyone says anything to her kids (when they're making a mess, yelling and telling adults to stop talking to them) unattended downstairs as she's on the couch upstairs. Telling my brother that I'm doing things when I haven't even spoken to this woman in months. I am so uncomfortable around her. I have said hi to her and things and have stopped, because it's a short ""hi"" and walks by. The last 6 months she's walked by me and hasn't said a word, no hi, no bye when she goes out the door. Walks by me or anyone in this house aside from my mom like we're not there.

I know this sounds pathetic coming from a man who's 28, but I'm actually sick and am developing actual dislike and almost even hate for this woman. She hogs the washer and dryer, tells me to turn my animal light off when she's going to bed (cause it's out where she sleeps in the upstairs loft). Tells me to get all my stuff out of there when it was my storage space and now my room is packed with all my things out there. Tells everyone to keep it down. You go down the stairs too loud (passed her) she will ask who's there and make a big deal out of it. If anyone says anything to their daughters being rude to us, they both snap (yes my brother too) and call us rude, guilt trip us and say ""they're 5 and 9 years old, this is the way youre going to talk to a kid!?!, or they were just trying to make a sandwich as they're telling us to ""stop taking to me or telling me what to do, you're not my mom or dad"" etc.

Is it bad that I want them all to move? I'm in my room most days when they're. I feel so trapped here, and I don't know what to do. I have no choice but to stay here until I find a job for people like me with chronic health issues - and they're never going to move because they constantly mooch off my mother.  She pays for their car accidents, their bills, their car rentals, their groceries, dinner, gives them money to go on dates and gas to go drive to work (even though they make their own money), etc.  My mom is starting to sort of agree she even wants them to move, and she won't step up and say anything to anyone. I tell her to or else I will. She goes ""NO DON'T!"" She's so afraid of these people -- and losing her grandkids. 

I don't know what to do."

Last weekend my 21 year old college daughter fell and was taken to the hospital via ambulance. We got a call from the hospital and my wife and I drove 4.5 hours to spend the night with her in the hospital. While there she had to go to the bathroom but called a nurse because she had to use a bed pan. Just before she went she asked us to leave the room and my wife and I refused because we wanted to get a cute photo of her on the bed pan to post to Facebook and compare to a baby photo of her when she first learned how to pee. She got very upset and called the nurse and told her to remove us from the room. This upset us, especially my wife but we tried to keep out composure until she was released from the hospital.

My BF and I decided to do DNA tests because they were on sale for black friday. We got our results back last week. I said yes to see family relationships. Turns out I have a cousin in the system. She reached out to me for information but I didn't even know she existed. 

Her bio mom says they she isn't ready to be in contact with her. From what I gather it was a teenage pregnancy and my grandparents forced her to give up the baby , moved her to a house for unwed mothers and moved the whole family away from their hometown to avoid embarrassment . I think it was a very traumatic experience for her and she may not want to bring up those memories. 

I feel stuck in the middle now and don't know how to deal with the situation. I suffer from social anxiety and this whole situation has caused me panic attacks. I feel bad for my newly found cousin and don't want to break her heart but I can't go around my aunts wishes. 

I don't have a lot of information about the family that I could pass on without talking to my aunt or other family members. I am the youngest cousin and my grandparents passed away when I was quite young.

Every time my parents come and visit us, I'm the one who has to clean the whole apartment. He doesn't help me with any of that. One time I just snapped because my parents were coming to visit us and I had been cleaning the apartment all day and she wanted me to wash his sheets and clean his bathroom and I said no, if there's one thing he can do when he gets home from work it's take the time to clean his bathroom and wash his sheets. My mom bitched at me because I wouldn't do it. But I'm just so tired of having to do everything myself. In case anyone asks, yes, I do pay my half of the rent with my own money. So it's not fair. I just don't know what to do anymore because I don't like saying things that might make me seem like I'm being dramatic or bratty to my parents. And they know he doesn't clean anything. They know I do it all by myself but they don't ever say anything to him. My parents are just so controlling too.

So about 6 months ago, my father had an accident which left him disabled. He lived in a 1 story ranch home. Being the only child that would be able to take care of my Dad, I moved my husband and 2 children to my dads house. Our house needed so much work, we wanted to sell it anyways, his house being 1 level worked so much better for him, allowed him to get around easier.
So my father has gotten a little better, can take care of himself in the bathroom, needs helps with cleaning, cooking etc. also can’t drive. We are still living with my dad. The living situation has really worked out for us all. I am a stay at home mom, so taking care of my dad and 2 children is very much manageable. My husband and I do have our own space in the house as well. Sooo can someone please tell me why I’m so embarrassed to tell people of our living situation? Everyone knows what happened to my dad, everyone knows he needs me but I sort of feel like a failure. I guess because we don’t own our own house. We have done so much work and updating to my fathers house to make it our own. We pay almost all of the bills too. I love that we are all together I’m just sick of telling the whole story of how my dad got hurt and why I had to move in with him and why we don’t own our own house.

So im a teenager aged only 14 , i live in Greece, my family was having issues, (my parents) started ~ 2015 and the real reason causing it was that my mother is working at my school as a cook , and a guy who finished his university ( i dont know what's called) of cooking  , he came to the school to work as head-chef , my father paranoia began at that time , he posted on facebook a post from my mother's profile tagging the cook and typing like this guy is my new boyfriend and stuff like that , my mother would never do that to my father, my father always had side-chicks beside her and he was being disloyal even at their marriage, also that head-chef was about 22 years old and my mother is 40-43 ... well lets go the main thing ! At 2017's March my mother's only brother (sibling in general) past away from heart disease and next month my father found this as distraction may i say to begin saying that my mother is a wh@re and is going to the school so the head-chef f@cks her.... its so sad guys that this guy left the work at school 3 months before that , he went to almost everyone he knew to characterize and judge my mother as a wh@re. Literally to everybody... well my mother shutted her mouth and stood back not resisting (i dont know how to describe it well) and actually let him come back to our house at approx. August , hm it went well shall i say for sometime but all of a sudden he left the house and went back to his paranoia .. he found a gypsy woman which he has relationship with now ( she is fat and ugly) , i managed to crack his facebook account and we ( me and my mom) got into his conversations with that ""lady"" and we found really smuttile stuff , there was things about v@brators and m@sturbating and really sad stuff in there .. my mother now has depression and she is so stressed (she considered suiciding actually) ... now that gypsy is controlling him and shes taking his money and she's trying to seduce him away from us , she's ridiculing him in public (cafes and other places).

She made me look for the house, call the agent, book an appointment, put an ad on facebook.... She said that she has some anxieties doing some of this which i guess i  can understand bc sometimes i have bouts of social anxiety that i can’t help so i am a little sympathetic... But she’s being very demanding, i couldn’t look at any houses over the weekend bc i was with my boyfriends meeting his parents and his family so i couldn’t drop all that and go on my laptop doing all of this !!

If i tell her that it’s looking to be an all female house with maybe one guy, i’m a little scared to know her reaction... But then again, she’s made me do all this work and yet would have to audacity to complain ?! 

I feel like she has a certain demographic in her head of what kind of boys she’d like in the house (she’s a lesbian so it’s not like that) ... idk ... 

I’m not sure what to do or say... shall i accept the girls that are actually willing to pay and be proactive or decline their offers JUST because my mate “wants boys”🙄?

**TLDR** friend and i need to look for a house with other ppl for next year, she’s making me do ALL the work, is demanding and wants some boys to live with us. Only girls have been seriously enquiring... how do i tell mate ?"
ff,"Alcoholic dad
It's been like this since I was 6 years old. Just to give information, my family and I lived on a farm before I was six and I rarely got into contact with people outside of my family so I barely knew how to talk and would rather screech and be mad all the time and this led me to be very bad at my own language and have few ""real"" friends. My dad's problem started when he started drinking after the company he worked in shutdown I didn't know about it but my family fought about it without my knowing and I don't even know my siblings that well due to me never having gotten any real attention I just sat in my room while they fought at age six and played a game of Madagascar and shut it out I started understanding at age 10 how bad I was with actual relationships i barely know even now how to initiate discussions with other people or relatives and cryed, everyone started to fight at age 11 now at age 16 my dad drove me and my friend from my other friends due to us having had a LAN (played games) and he almost drove right into the railing of a bridge and that was today now that it wasn't just me who was endangered because of his fucking problem I started getting mad. He barely cares what I say and what my mom says he probably wants to leave my mom but doesn't have the financial expertise or job to do so. I dont know what to do and I barely have the guts to cut myself or anything just banging my head into a wall when my parents aren't home or watching people play games. If you read this whole thing thank you. My dad had gotten physical a few times as well. 

Sorry for the wall of text."
ff,"Advice to restore lost friendship?
My cousin and I used to be best friends when we were little. We told each other everything and were inseparable. Then, a bunch of terrible stuff happened to her around middle school and in high school. She shut herself away. Even though we used to tell each other everything, she didn't talk to me as much after that. I love her, and I wanted her to know she could trust me, like she always could. But she didn't talk to me. Or anyone else. 

Then she moved a whole state away for a couple years. We drifted apart. Far apart. I used to consider her my very best friend, but at that point I didn't feel that way anymore. She now lives close to me again, and we have started hanging out again. I feel like we are starting to get our friendship back, but I still feel like there is something preventing us from getting back to how we used to be when we were little. She has depression and anxiety as a result of everything she has been through. I want her to know I am there for her and that she can trust me completely.

I do know her well enough that I can tell when she is having a hard time with something, and today, I could tell she was struggling. I asked how she was doing, and she was upset because she and her boyfriend have been fighting a lot lately. I asked her more about it, but she didn't want to talk about it. That's completely fine; I understand. And I told her as much and also let her know I am always here for her if she needs anything.

Now, I say all of that to ask this: how can I let her know that she can open up to me without sounding too pushy? I want to regain what we once had. How can I restore that closeness we used to have?"

Hi, so, I recently met this new group of people, and it's been pretty nice being with them, but there's this one girl that I have a crush on. About a week ago, one of my friends whom I have known for ~4 years told her, and she said there was a high chance she would go out with me, and has been telling me stuff she has said, and he said that if I was going to ask her out, I should wait 1-3 weeks. Well, recently, they seem to be getting closer and closer to each other, and I have heard that he has a crush on her as well, and wants her to date him instead of me, and when I asked him about it, he got all defensive about it.

Everything about it just screams ""Hell no"" in my brain... safety issues with traveling to Mexico as a whole, she is 17, I don't know his parents, they have only been dating for 6 months... she says I'm overreacting about the violence in Mexico and that she doesn't do drugs so there is nothing to worry about... he is a good kid but he is 2 years older and in college (they went to the same high school). It's bad enough that I don't like the age difference... (they look the same age and act like the same age, they just aren't the same age)

Wondering if anyone can tell me it's all going to be okay in the sense that 65 is not that old, and that I still have time to make memories and learn from my dad at his age. I'm 26. The concept of him having nothing new to teach me and needing me to take care of him now is truly devastating, because it's hitting me how much time has gone by, and just the idea of me being more capable than my father is a bit scary. He's healthy, smart, independent, wise. He still seems the same as he always did except for being a bit more gray, and you can see the age in his face a bit clearer. He drives himself around, works, volunteers, has a long distance relationship. He just seems to be a bit upset and nervous about the state of my life. Like I'm always complaining and yammering about something and it's hard on him. Yet all he wants to do is help me, so he keeps trying, and every time, he just gets put through the ringer and it's hard on him. I feel so bad because I say very harsh things and he's such a fragile person, trying so hard to be tough in this world. And I know shocking the system when you're old is hard on you. So I'm trying to just be mature, put all of the mess behind me, and ensure evevery time him and I are together now, he can see that I'm all good, grown up, and not going to make everything bad for him again.

ff,"I guess I’m done with her? Or is there something wrong with my attitude?
So, in the Literature class, we did a practice exam paper and we had a peer assessment.
One of my friend had my paper and it turns out she graded mine the lowest in the class.
The teacher was actually surprised on her harsh mark and said jokingly ‘Hey, he (me) did all right. Isn’t that too harsh?.

Later I approached to her to ask what was it that she gave mine a low grade.
Then, she rants out all the things I’ve done wrong, but she spoke so fast that I couldn’t quite catch all of them.
And I became a bit angry at her attitude because
1. She spoke so fast (so I couldn’t quite catch 30% of her points) which is likely to be intentional so I’m startled before I can argue back.
2. Majority of her points were about that I lacked explicit points, but the teacher ticked all the points and said they were explicit enough?

So, I said back to her ‘Hey but the teacher said the essay was all right’
She scoffs and says:
‘Yeah, write like that in the real exam and you will totally pass. Who are you kidding?’

Now I wouldn’t really complain if she actually gave me valid constructive criticism,
but she spoke so fast (likely to be intentionally) and most of her points came from simply her not reading carefully enough..

BTW, she actually achieves better grades than I do and is clearly smarter than I am. Not trying to be boastful, but in this Literature class, I really think it’s safe to say that I get better grades than her most of the times. And, she’s not a teacher. What the hell does she know better than the teacher to say things like that, especially when she gets lower grades than I do most of the time???

Besides, she really always says rude things in front of someone’s faces (and many many times in front of my face).. and she’s sometimes in her own world and can get really arrogant and cynical.

I guess I’m done with her right? Or is there something wrong with my attitude?
I regretted a couple of times being friend with her in the first place, and now I really see that there can be no good staying with her.
And, I'm in my final year before graduation... I feel quite embarrassed that I'm complaining about this kind of friendship problem and I know I should be focusing on studying, but thinking about this gets me angry every time."

I have a particular friend from highschool who always wants to meet up with me. We were good friends then purely due to convenience I feel, and over time we’ve become really different people. She had a bout of depression and has been struggling with these issues for several years now. 

I don’t feel like she’s responded to my own issues well, and for some reason her method of reassuring me is to “move on, and get over it”. I’m not quite sure how I feel about that considering I would never say that to her. It’s gotten to the point where she would occasionally send me messages on Facebook about her ill mental health and says that I am the only one she can talk to about this, despite having a boyfriend and other friends already. 

I want to cut her off, but at the same time for some reason I feel guilty to? Like here’s an emotionally vulnerable person and I’m not sure if I’m just adding to her despair. But I dread seeing her messages and I get tired thinking about her. I’ve also suggested professional help but she’s shot that down many times.

ff,"hot and cold friend
I do quite a bit of online gaming on console the past year and have made some great friendships during the span of time. Some of them have developed into stronger friendships (we bond on more than just gaming). I became close with one guy in particular and I'd say he's become one of my best friends. We met each other through a mutual group but through shared interests and our ease in conversation, we became close enough to add each other on various social platforms and IM. Initially, we texted all the time but I've been noticing very recently, his texts have gotten shorter and less frequent. I get that eventually friendships can go through lulls but I feel like things have changed. I had always thought he was very sweet and affectionate; always asking about my day, initiating conversations, and just being a kind friend in general. If it's been a couple of hours and i haven't replied, he'd message me to check up. I admit it was a bit intense at first but I had gotten used to it and reciprocated. But now that he's kind of dropped off, I feel like I am becoming overbearing and that's the last thing I want to be. I feel like I'm putting in more effort to keep a conversation going these days. I've brought up the change in our interaction but he reassures me nothing is wrong yet things just aren't what they used to be. On top of that, I am starting to feel this tiny annoyance grow inside of me...I don't nearly game as much as he does so when I do come online, we usually play games together. Sometimes we play with other friends but about half the time or more, we game with each other. We don't really play in groups much because he's a bit of an introvert and doesn't feel comfortable in large group settings. The other day, I was invited to play with a friend we made online. Prior to this, my friend and I had some particularly frustrating games so he was signing off early. But me not wanting to play with our new friend alone, i told him i got an invite and got him back online pretty quick to join me...but the whole time he was kind of silently sulking until he texted me he just thought it was weird that this guy would want to play with me and that was what made him feel weird. Eventually he warmed up and started talking like a normal person so I was happy by the time I called it a night and found that all of them were bonding. These incidents have happened a handful of times in the past month and it's left me slightly annoyed and very confused."

ff,"Should I reach out to her or leave it alone? (TL;DR)
I had a friend and it ended pretty bad IMO. I’ve really missed her over the past couple years and I thought about re-befriending her but I’m not sure.

I’ll start with the good things about our past friendship: -she was pretty sweet to me. Very supportive of most things. -She stood up for me when like half the school picked on me for having a 2 foot bright orange Mohawk. -She tried to keep me from dating a pretty Toxic boy (but at the time I was young and wouldn’t listen) -She made me walk around the entire town with her frequently (helped me lose the weight I’d gained and build some muscle in my legs) -She was for the most part a great friend

Now the bad: -since I didn’t listen about Toxic boy, we ended up dating for about 4 years. He’s said he didn’t like her cause when they went to school together she flirted with him and when he kissed her in the hallway she told the school he sexually assaulted her and got him sent to juvie. Now while I’m not gonna go into the semantics of whether or not it was s. Assault in anyway, I will say she fully apologized to him and me for it a while back but he made me tell her that we didn’t accept her apology and to “fuck off” -She borrowed a couple box sets of shows from me around this time, those sets were given to me by favorite aunt when I was young. When I wanted them back she claimed she couldn’t find them. Almost a year went by of her “looking” for them, and I told her (mostly from Toxic boy pushing me to) if she didn’t find them by the end of the week I was going to call the police and report her for stealing them. She gave them back to me a couple days later (scratched, though I don’t know if she knew they were scratched) -I also shortly dated, and quickly broke up with one of her brothers last year (our personalities didn’t really mix well) but I don’t think she holds it against me

The manority of us breaking up was due to Toxic Boy (he’s he was toxic, he tried to fuck literally any girl friend I introduced him to) pushing me into breaking up with her, telling me she was the toxic one cause she didn’t support our relationship and cause of the juvie thing from years before.

In 2015 she reached out to me on Facebook saying: “Hey i know your probably the last person you wanna hear from but, i just wanted to say im sorry for all the bullshit that happened when i was still in school. If you don't wanna be friends thats understandable, just know thats not me anymore, and im sorry” Which, of course, Toxic boy made me to reply incredibly rudely to and our friend ship just kind of died.

So I need a second, strangers, opinion. What do I do?

I am in such a shit situation I don't know what to do. Myself and ex partner both have a child who is nearly 8 years old. We have been separated for a number of years and i see my daughter at weekends. The mother of my daughter isn't a bad person, she had a lot of bad stuff to deal with when she was younger. She basically smokes weed to shut out all the bad stuff and usually only does this when our daughter is in bed. A lot of the time she has threatened to kill herself and this has happened in front of my daughter I'm sure  which is so wrong. Today when I went round she started getting angry and I heard my daughter say to her 'if you don't stop I will run in front of a car when I'm older'. This has broke my heart completely and I don't know what to do. I hope my daughter doesn't mean this and is just copying her mum, but this is only gonna get worse as she gets older.

ff,"Ending a friendship - am I overreacting?
I'm looking for advice from impartial people.

To give a little background information, I recently went through a nasty split with my fiance of several years. My relationship with him, up until the dividing issue, was solid.

I have just discovered that my best friend spent many months telling my coworkers that my relationship was illegitimate, that I was only dating him because I pitied him for his looks, and that my fiance and I were really just platonic friends but that I agreed to get married out of desperation. (To be clear, none of this is true - although others do find him to be unattractive in a conventional sense, I did not. She was projecting.) As a result, as I have now learned, my LEGITIMATE relationship became a workplace joke, and everyone has been mocking me and my fiance behind our backs for a year, including my bosses. This also includes people who I excitedly called after getting engaged and people that I had offered positions in my wedding party to. To make things worse, the fact that the relationship ended is being blamed on me being shallow about his appearance and is being used as vindication for these rumors. Not that it matters, but it ended for a plethora of deeply ingrained and painful issues, none of which were in any way related to appearance.

I feel so betrayed by this friend that I can't imagine ever reconciling. I am preparing to completely cut her from my life and just want to know if others would do the same, or if I'm overreacting to average workplace drama."

I also grew up with a bottle a night alcoholic of a father and neurotic mother who had to have everything her way or...well there was no ""or"". My parents loudly fought most of my childhood, very loudly I might add, which was very VERY terrifying for a small child. And if I may rewind just a bit I was diagnosed with a pretty big case of ADHD which I was medicated for from the age of 8 till I was 20. That being said, my neurotic mother decided it would be good for her to practically do my homework for me. It didn't help that since I have ADHD I would I had zero filter, making me a target for most of the school bullies...and there were alot. I got a job when I was sixteen and worked almost 40 hours a week just so I could have at the least 8 hours out of the house to just be myself. My mother noticed I wasn't happy and sent me to therapist after therapist...I lied to them mostly because they would probably judge me if I told them the truth and I really didn't want anybody to know what happened inside the confines of my own home. Around the age of 21 I found drugs...well pot really and booze. I loved it right away, it was like I forgot everything that had made me sad or depressed.

do,"Hey everyone!

So after seeing the new Monarch cards I decided to try to use them to revive my favorite deck from 2015, Qliphort. The floodgate build has sucked ever since Twin Twister was released, since the deck's goal when MST was meta was to make your opponent choose between either destroying Scout, or your floodgate. Twin Twister lets them destroy both and ruin your day.

With the new Monarch cards, I threw together a near-trapless beatdown style deck on Thursday night, and even without testing it hardly at all I went 3-1 at my locals on Saturday, tying for 2nd place.

**Main Deck**

1 Qliphort Scout

2 Qliphort Monolith

3 Qliphort Shell

3 Qliphort Disk

3 Qliphort Stealth

3 Qliphort Helix

3 Qliphort Carrier

1 Saqlifice

3 Wavering Eyes

3 Upstart Goblin

3 Summoners Art

3 Pantheism of the Monarchs

3 Tenacity of the Monarchs

3 The Monarchs Stormforth

1 The Prime Monarch

2 Qlimate Change

**Extra Deck**

Didn't bother putting one together since because pickles. Oh and those pendulum scale restrictions.

**Side Deck**

2 MST (will be Twin Twisters once I get them next weekend)

3 Shadow Imprisoning Mirror (lots of BA at my locals)

2 Pendulum Impenetrable (Sided in every time to protect scales)

3 Lose 1 Turn (for PePe)

2 Necrovalley (for Monarchs)

3 Imperial Iron Wall (for Kozmo)


**Round 1: Lost 0-2 versus PePe**

Game 1: I lose the die roll and he goes 1st. He goes off hard setting up the good old Rafflesia and CDI field. Also has a set Wavering. My hand is good but he has answers for everything I do and wins quickly.

Game 2: We agree to side out Wavering Eyes and I go first. Unfortunately I don't see any side deck cards and end up just setting up my extra deck with a Disk play. He opens strong with Luster + Plushfire, and ends up Castel-ing my Scout back into the deck, and has too much advantage for me to overcome.

**Round 2: Won 2-0 versus Nekroz**

Game One: I win the roll and choose to go second. He sets a backrow and passes. Open with Scout and search Monolith. Then I Pantheism discarding Stormforth, drawing a Disk and a Stealth. I pendulum summon a Helix and a Carrier from my hand and tribute them for Disk. Disk summons 2 Qli's from deck and I attack for heavy damage. He scoops next turn and reveals to me a hand full of ritual monsters that aren't Brio or Clausolus.

Game 2: He makes me go first. I open well and use a Stealth play to search twice. Setting Qlimate Change and Lose 1 Turn. He Raigeki's me and Twin Twisters my Scout and Lose 1 Turn. Then he summons Decisive Armor and Valk, hitting me for big damage before drawing cards with Valk's effect and passing. Luckily he missed my Qlimate Change, so I use it to get back my scales. Scout grabs me a Disk, and Disk plus Stormforth wipes out most of his lifepoints. He tries to recover and gets over my Disk on his turn, but I just Stealth him on my next turn for game.

**Round 3: won 2-1 versus BA**

Game 1: I lose the dice roll and go second. He makes double Dante and sets 2. I get Fire Lake'd hard on my turn and can't come back from it.

Game 2: I go first and open dirty with Scout and 2 Shadow Imprisoning Mirrors. He can't out them and I poke him for 1800 a couple turns in a row before finishing him off with Stormforth and Disk.

Game 3: He goes first and makes a Dante, but mills absolute garbage and just sets 1 and passes. I'm able to set up Scout and Monolith as scales, then tribute a Helix and Carrier for a Stealth to clear his board and swing for 2800. He can't do much on his turn and I pendulum summon and swing for game afterwards.

**Round 4: won 2-0 versus another BA**

Game 1: He goes first and makes double Dante, but mills crap with both and passes. I draw a bunch off double Pantheism and Carrier/Stealth away both Dantes. He makes another Dante the following turn but I just Stormforth it for Disk and kill him on my turn.

Game 2: He goes first but apparently bricks with a lot of discard traps, because he set 5 but never stopped any of my plays on my turn. I get Shadow Imprisoning set before he can get a Dante on board and it locks him out of the game.

**Thoughts**

I'd appreciate any feedback on the deck. It needs work but seems decent so far. One strength is that the 2 most popular hand traps of the format do nothing to the deck, as Effect Veiler can't touch tribute summoned Qliphorts and Maxx ""C"" only plusses if you are going for a Disk play. I think I'd like to try 1 Escalation of the Monarchs because summoning Stealth on the opponent's turn seems really good in theory. Other than that, I was just happy to do well with a deck that isn't meta. After the tourney my opponent from round 3 congratulated me for topping with Qli's even with how heavily they've been hit."

The 11 was recommended by a sex worker friend (he's used it on clients for g- and p-spot play), though the pure wand is WAY cheaper and seems to get the job done from what reviews state.  I am definitely a size queen but so far have only squirted with hands (vibrator isn't important here, so the toy can cover my clit during use), so size would be nice but is not neccessary. 

I guess the question is, has anyone used both, and if so, HOW MUCH better is one over the other?

Many thanks in advance!"
do,"Hi everyone :) I never really considered myself a furry but i know better haha. I've been lurking for a while now and I'm not really involved in the community, but I really love the art and you all are some of the nicest people around. So I just wanted to say hi!

do,"So long story short when I was 10 till I was 15 I had a psychologist. I am not comfortable talking about why because I don't want to trigger anyone who is sensitive to what I did and because frankly I have come to terms with the fact that doing it again is just selfish. Well in any case I ran into him a few months back and joined his little group just out of obligation and left because I didn't like being lied to.
Well today he called me for a cup of coffee to catch up. Thing is instead of catching up it was him trying to pressure me back into rejoining. It just so happens that during this he kept hammering away at certain things that only him and one other person knows to try and get across the point that I need the group so I should come back ""home"" as he out it. The fact that it was such a exact and secret thing really makes me think he is using stuff he remembers about me to manipulate me. It's only been ~5 years since I stopped going to his practice and I know for a fact that he has a thick binder with notes on me (long story but basically a month or 2 ago I was doing some work at his house and on his desk in his study was a file with my birth name on it which I haven't used since middle school. I didn't think much of it at the time but after this I'm a bit freaked out) so it's not to crazy to think he knows how to make me tick right? Am I just going crazy?"

do,"Yesterday (Thursday), a young man was fairly sick (no v*, had stomach cramps and d* according to his girlfriend.) but he thinks he had food poisoning.  

Another man, however, v* from Monday until Wednesday night.  He was still very pale today and had to go to the nurse for stomach medicine frequently.

When I got home, I washed my hands and pur on gloves.  I then disinfected everything and then took a hot shower.  I didn't even retouch my clothes, as I put them in a plastic bag before showering.

I figured that'd be enough but now my stomach hurts (no stomach cramps or stabbing pain that's commonly associated with any stomach bug, just a nagging n* feeling.)  I ate some Macorni and Cheese about 3 hours ago, so I'm not hungry.

I am going through some very anxious family-related issues (I recently got adopted by my grandparents, mom and sister are moving, etc, etc.) and took a huge two-day test last week (and I won't know the results for almost another month!)

I have a massive tension or sinus headache and mild n* (no d*, in fact I'm actually constipated (if this word isn't okay tell me.))  Am I coming down with a stomach bug or is it more anxiety related?"
do,When I attempt to observe my breath I become anxious about not breathing 'correctly' and I begin to regulate ny breath.

A fucked up lonely and angry monster. I push people away, and those who don't get pushed away get their lives ruined while I ruin my own life before they leave, and tbh I don't really give a fuck about anything anymore. I've fooled myself into thinking I care but really I'm just a shell of a pathetic excuse of life. I'm already dead inside.

But I keep just going back to ryu when I'm on a losing streak in ranked or just get mad or whatever. I know Ken's supposed to be a better character but for the way I play I don't know. You need to be aggressive with Ken, or so I'm told. With ryu I feel like I don't always have to be in the enemy's face but with Ken it seems like you need to. Also ryu's normals are just like better than Ken's, and I feel like I know when to use any one of his normals. Like they're self explanatory. With Ken I'm totally lost on what normals to use when. I have practiced in training mode A LOT and I have pretty much all of both of their bnb and punish combos down, I just don't really know like what my game plan is as Ken.

Personally, make Nair come out 4 frames earlier, less lag, auto cancel or give it a bigger hitbox to make it harder for opponents to fall off will be enough to make him better than now. Giving him an OoS option besides jab and having a reliable combo started will be so good to make him bump up a few spots on the tier lists. Another thing could be giving down throw a smaller DI multiplier (like DK's up throw or Bowser's) so D-throw to U-air is a reliable kill confirm."
do,"***On China:***

Currently, the People's Republic of China is engaging in the same kind of expansionism the United States warned the world about just a few years back. Tibet fell easily and this gave the Chinese the confident to push claims elsewhere. 

We are sure they would have taken all of the Korean peninsula if our government hadn't vehemently argued for United Nations troops to be stationed in the area. And now they are pushing claims on islands almost [nine hundred thousand kilometers away](http://scarboroughshoalpinoy.weebly.com/uploads/1/1/4/4/11449201/9815922_orig.jpg) from their shore, and threatening the territorial integrity of their neighbors. 

This cannot go on. 

To the People's Republic of China, we warn that its current expansionist policies must end. We have accepted to keep ourselves at the margin, merely trying to maintain civilians safe during the Chinese invasion of the islands in the strait of Taiwan. But we cannot continue doing so if China continues being a threat to the stability of the region. 

We know that only our warnings will fall upon deaf ears, so we call upon the nations in the region and all members of SEATO to band together and warn the Chinese that violating the territorial integrity of a single nation will be the same as violating the territorial integrity of all South East Asian nations, as it will be clear that they are all possible targets for Chinese invasion and possible annexation. 

We also speak to the nations of the world when we say that the United States has not engaged Chinese troops in any way, shape or form, and that we do not wish for open conflict with the Chinese. But we also say that we will protect the territorial integrity of all the nations in the region from Chinese aggression, and that we will use all means necessary to ensure peace in the region. Again we say, we do not wish for war, but we will accept our responsibility if the Chinese government forces our hand. 

The People's Republic of China cannot continue threatening its neighbors over territory that is almost nine hundred thousand kilometers from its coast. It is simply as ridiculous as the United States laying claim to the Canary Islands, or the Soviet Union laying claim to Ireland. It is absurd. 

The Chinese must be willing to negotiate, lest they be willing to initiate war with multiple nations over such an absurd proposition.

***On the Austrian Question*** 

Although we are aware of the current instability the Soviet Union is experiencing after the death of Stalin, the United States believes it is due time for the Soviet Union and our government to negotiate the release and demilitarization of Austria, as a single, unified nation. 

To this aim, we propose the complete removal of both American and Soviet troops from Austrian soil by 1959 and the declaration by the future Austrian nation of complete neutrality now and forever in the same form as Switzerland has remained neutral over the centuries. 

They will be allowed to retain a small military force for self-defense but will not be allowed to use this military outside of their own borders. just as it was agreed with the Japanese at the end of WWII.

Both the United States  and the Soviet Union would agree to respect the neutrality of the Austrians and their territorial integrity, and the Austrians will be accountable for remaining neutral: Neither western nor soviet-aligned, but respecting both ideologies and engaging neither. 

We also take this opportunity to urge the Soviet Union to attempt to reason with their Chinese allies, as it would be irresponsible to let their rhetoric continue and possibly cause an incident that all nations involved would regret."
do,"Seriously, this subreddit gets a little annoying because you can't tell what gender anyone is, unless they say it. I get so annoyed when I finish it thinking its a guy, then its a girl, or the other way around.

Edit: I'm quite new to this subreddit, and bisexuality in general. I am a guy that has recently discovered that I am bi. It is also interesting to see the assumptions that you make be wrong, and which ones were right, it really helps the view you have of the world. It is the great thing about being bi.

I enjoy activities, but only as long as I can focus on them (which isn't very often). I'm not ""sad"" all the time. Does depression explain the several accidents I've almost gotten into because of impulsive driving decisions? Does it explain how I have to switch back to my email every five minutes when i have to do something at work that I don't like?

do,"So I noticed my bumps on my waist, pelvis and belly button about 2 weeks ago. Since then I've seen two Dr's who diagnosed it as Molluscum. It's spreading like crazy downwards and I'm totally depressed beyond belief. I used to take baths ever night before I noticed it so that might be part of why it spread. I'm taking all precautions I can now. I'm just scared it's gonna start spreading all over my body since I caught it late.

 They gave me podophyllum resin 25% with directions of twice a day for 3 days, 4 days rest. Repeat for 4 weeks. According to my research that is the directions for the other less strong medicine, I have to call my Dr to double check. But it's drying out the skin around my penis like crazy and making them spread I think. I now have around 60-70 bumps and clusters varrying in size. The medicine made them blister and just come back, one even literally turned green and scabbed off and underneath was a little hole, and the bump looks like it started growing back again. I'm fucking nuking it with this medicine that destroys DNA and it won't kill it. My questions are:

Have you ever had this? 

Have you ever treated this?

How long should this take? Is a case of 70 bumps mean I'll have it for years like the horror stories online?

How can I cover them to stop spreading? Some are in folds of skin that are impossible to cover. 

Should I stop all contact with any human beings? Or is covering it enough?

Im going crazy with sanitizing everything, washing hands every 5 minutes, washing everything daily. Im losing my mind. All I really want to hear are some stories of a similar situation where they were cleared for good. I'm getting every answer imaginable online. I've been dealing with depression and loneliness the past 5 years and was finally about to turn things around. I have an appointment with a dermatologist in 3 weeks. I can't find much reliable info on this. Even called the CDC and they had hardly anything on the genital kind. Please give me some words or stories of hope. Thank you.."

CPU and GPU will be watercooled. (~400usd for parts)

**I have following questions:**

Is the CPU and MOBO overkill? Should I get something cheaper like an i5-5820K? I have no clue what is gimmicky marketing on motherboards and what not.

**I want:**  
- 1x m.2 port  
- Lan + WIFI Ethernet (since I currently can only use WIFI) 
- Good Overclock Support   

**
Not so important:**  
- Should look good in a watercooled setup lol  
- SLI, I intend to not run SLI just yet but if its able to that would be a plus  

Budgetwise I do not really care if its 3k or 4k, I just want to build an awesome computer but my knowledge of CPU/MOBO is not up to par. 

Im giving my current build to my brother which is why I intend to upgrade.

do,"I consider myself a pretty frequent gym-goer, I lift 4 times a week at my college gym. Weightlifting is something I really enjoy, one of the only things I consistently do nowadays, so it's pretty important to me. Therefore I'd like to meet more people who are into it as well. 

This semester I've been going around the same time, so I see familiar faces a lot. A lot of people have their earphones in so it isn't easy to talk. Then also I'm kind of shy/introverted. There's this one girl who both works and lifts at the gym, we had a class together over a year ago, so whenever we see each other we make small talk and talk about what we're working out that day. I think it'd be really cool to be friends with her but I don't know how I would go about initiating that. She seems to be on the more extroverted side since she seems to know a lot of the employees and regular gym goers, she usually talks to them as well.

Then also it would be nice to meet guys at the gym. I find it really attractive when guys are into lifting, so theoretically the gym would be the perfect place. Except I have never approached a guy. Sometimes I make eye contact with guys at the gym but it's usually because I just glanced in that direction. I see guys looking at me too, but I never know how to interpret that (Checking me out? Staring into the distance? It's a mystery). There's this attractive guy that also works/lifts at the gym frequently and I've caught him looking at me a few times, we make eye contact but I break it after like a second. I guess I'm attractive and I'd say I have a nice body thanks to lifting heavy. But anyways how does a quiet person go about meeting people at the gym??"
do,"Me and this girl I met she and I instantly hit it off. We both told eachother things we never told anyone else. I felt like she and I both must be empaths because she suffers from ""energy vampires"" she says. But anyway after hanging out with her I suddenly was feeling horny. I visualized her and me and I am straight and happily married. It lasted three days and always at the same time of day. I was curious if she and I linked in some way. It went away after awhile but she also stopped speaking to me. We only hung out once and all these things happened so very fast. 

I'm a baby empath, I've not figured out how to set boundaries yet and I have alot of trouble separating my own feelings from others. 

I was curious if other people have had this happen and I wondered if I scared her away. Somehow she and I just clicked in a way I've never done with a stranger. It's almost sad we don't talk now but, I wondered if I felt her being attracted to me (she's pansexual.)  

I just wanted to ask if I was crazy."

do,"I am currently 21 years old and taking my bachelors in Illustration. Ever since I was young I used to be heavily artistic and many people in my family agree that art has always been my primary talent. I ended up taking two years off after high school to decide where I wanted to go from here. The first year I was in an artistic fundamentals class which I absolutely despised and received poor marks in. The second year I took off to do a little soul searching with no luck however did manage to work at 5 different places to attain some general work experience. I had the guts to apply to a very competitive program for the arts which I made it into. I’m just about to reach the end of my first year and it has also been similarly dreadful to my first year in art school. I don’t understand why this correlation is happening and I assumed that I would be happy in a field that many claim I am naturally talented within. Sadly that doesn’t appear to be the case and I still don’t understand why. College has also been a struggle recently due to my Panic disorder I’ve been fighting since I was only 5 years old and my clinical depression which I had since high school. I am aware I have these issues and am undergoing therapy and my own personal research to help manage and rid myself of these issues. When I think about some of the major causes of my depression, the reason has been similar for the past few months: I feel that I will not find stable employment with a degree in the arts considering graphic design isn’t my cup of tea and I’m struggling to learn digital programs for drawing/modeling/etc. I figure that if I am struggling in the classes and also not enjoying my studies that it may be an indication that I should learn a little more about myself and take a different path. At the same time too though, my family tells me that I could branch my current bachelors into a teaching degree and find a lot of potential with a degree from a high end/well known art school. All these thoughts have been conflicting me a lot recently and I’m certainly at quite a crossroad for what to do. I don’t want to make any rash decisions but at the same time I also wonder if my mental health and overall happiness would improve if I was in a program that I felt I had more of an impact on society within. Besides the arts I am also very passionate about mental health/psychology/social working and recently developed a connection to foods/nutrition, mindfulness and exercise to help me cope with my current struggles. From an outsider’s perspective, what do you think would be an appropriate approach to my current scenario?"

So me and 2 other friends had planned this, they're both stoners so they were really nice and helpful. 2 other friends came but they didn't smoke they were just there to spot us and chill with us. Anyways I come to my friends place and we walked to the shops to go get some snacks and then went back to smoke. We were in her garden with my other friend and they both took and hit and handed it to me, Btw I was pretty much shitting my pants but they calmed me down and told me it was gonna be awesome, so I took a small hit becuase I didn't wanna cough my lungs out but I still coughed anyways, first off it tasted like complete shit, I still took 2 more hits and then I was done. We went back inside and after about 5 minutes it hit me, it felt like I was in one of those crooked houses at a fairground or theme park, I started hysterically laughing, I had crazy body tingles and I couldn't move from the sofa. It was like I had become a part of the sofa haha, we put on pink floyd and chilled it was really really fun, then another friend came over and he was like ""oh you guys smoked, I wanna do it"" so we did it again and I didn't really get high, I dont think my hits were big enough but I still had the giggles. overall it was a memorable experience I'll definitely be trying it again."
do,"**Box Full of Kisses (Love)**

Some time ago, a man (Mohammad Safdar Gohir)  punished his 3-year-old daughter for wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became infuriated when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree.

Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, “This is for you, Daddy.”

The man (Mohammad Safdar Gohir) became embarrassed by his overreaction earlier, but his rage continue when he saw that the box was empty. He yelled at her; “Don’t you know, when you give someone a present, there is supposed to be something inside?”

The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and cried;

“Oh, Daddy, it’s not empty at all. I blew kisses into the box. They’re all for you, Daddy.”

The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl, and he begged for her forgiveness.

Only a short time later, an accident took the life of the child. Her father kept the gold box by his bed for many years and, whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there.

**Moral of the story:**

Love is the most precious gift in the world."
do,"Hey, I hope this is the right forum to post this on. 


I've always had eczema on my face and small patches on my inner elbows, and a little on my neck too. Lately the patch on one inner elbow has spread all over my arm, but I'm not sure if it is still eczema as it doesn't look like any eczema I have had. 


[Here](http://m.imgur.com/jouZ0UT,AgwlfEU,S3SZ4d7,JzW25JB,xw9Ehcl)  are some pictures, I hope I formatted that right as I am on mobile. The red is ever so slightly raised and quite bumpy in some patches. There is one dry flaky spot which is where my eczema originally started. It gets very hot and itchy.


Does anyone have an idea how to control this? It just seems to be spreading and getting redder and I'm not sure what is causing it. I have used cetraben, aveeno, cerave in the tub, sudocrem to stop the itching and hydrocortisone cream. Obviously not all at once! I have used those products for years so I don't know if I have become allergic to one of them? 


I've just ordered some evening primrose oil as my nan told me that helps to moisturise. I have sensitive skin and my eczema on my face flares up to absolutely anything (can't even use Simple skincare anymore) so I will make sure to patch test.


Sorry for the long post - I have the doctors on tuesday for another issue so I will mention it then to see if they have a solution. Thank you in advance"
do,"This is a bit long, please bear with me.

My partner and I are into BDSM, we have a D/s relationship. I am his domme. However, he is a switch. I told him I could not provide for the dominant side of him as I do not have a submissive bone in my body, but he was welcome to go elsewhere.

I don't know what I really expected to happen - would he have open relationships on a DADT basis? See a pro? I didn't really think it through, looking back. He met a lady on FetLife, and she is absolutely lovely. They went on a couple of dates, and then I met her. She is polyamorous and has a husband and a boyfriend, not including my partner. 

Well last week we ended up having a threesome. I guess I expected that, but didn't really know what would happen afterwards.

I had got on board with Steve (partner) being poly; it isn't something I knew much about so I did a lot of reading and we talked a lot. But we never really considered ME being poly. 

She changed her FetLife the next day to include 'Polyamorous with Jessica' and I panicked. I don't know if I am poly or mono or what?!

So the long and short of it is, I enjoy spending time with her, and enjoy playing with her, but I'm not sure if I am ready to be in a new relationship or if I am even poly. I am going through a really bad patch in my life at the moment and this just really frightened me, I can't even explain it.

I know there isn't just one answer to this question, but any advice would be really appreciated!

do,"Hi guys, 

I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until I was 19 years old. I always just squeaked by in elementary and high school, and was never able to pay attention. Finally I sat down in my doctor's office bawling my eyes out because I failed an exam I had studied and studied for. I was referred to a specialist and found out I had severe ADHD, depression, OCD, and anxiety. 

I am now in my 3rd year of university and I am struggling more than ever. I never learned how to study as a kid because I just couldn't. I would try to study, never retain anything, get a passing score on a test, go home and do whatever kids do after school. My parents never really suspected anything. Both my teachers and my parents told me to try harder and apply myself. I WAS trying and I WAS applying myself. Nothing was working, and it still isn't working. 

Basically, what I am asking for are suggestions. Suggestions on how to deal with adult ADHD at work and at school. How to study (tips, tricks, methods). Suggestions on how to get people to understand this is a real thing and that I'm not just annoying or looking for an excuse to get out of something. I don't know how to deal with it and I am thinking of just quitting school. If anyone can help, please do."
do,"I was re-watching my favorite show Black Mirror, and I was on the episode *Hated in the Nation* and to make a short run down on a huge component of the episode, they had these small robotic bees, that were artificial pollinators because in the episode (which was in a futuristic society set not too far away from current years) bees have been wiped out. The bees seemed to make artificial hives as well sort of like a very very small 3D printer. they flew about freely and would pollinate flowers, report back to hives, basically did everything bees do, minus the honey. The episode is horror based but I wanted to ask about the concept of ADI's.

If bees were wiped out, do you think scientists would step into make artificial bee-like drones similar to [this] (https://fsmedia.imgix.net/db/39/4d/5c/835f/4a74/ac95/0170f1285708/robot-bee-drone-pollinate.png) 

I'm not saying that it is going to happen and that it is our only option, but I am not saying that it is that far off to be considered crazy. I just wanted to know if anyone has ever thought of our ""action plan"" about life after bees.

do,"Hey guys, 

Just got back from my very first session with the psychiatrist. I was really, really, nervous but he was super nice and that helped me work with him. 

I had printed out and highlighted pages from ADDitude.com and Wiki with things that especially related to me. I also printed out some info about RSD to show him. 

After the session, he said I had ""textbook"" symptoms of ADHD, Anxiety, and mild Depression but didn't tell me which type of ADHD he thought I might have. He prescribed 150mg of Wellbutrin XR and scheduled another appointment in a month. 

Is this common? I had heard that doctors typically run a bunch of tests to determine which type of ADHD you have before they begin treatment. 

He did say that he was reluctant to prescribe stimulants because they could make anxiety worse. Could that be the reason we didn't dig into my ADHD more?

do,"Throwaway because my girlfriend knows my regular account.


Anyway, I am  a 22 year old male. I was diagnosed with BPD a little over a year ago, and I fit pretty well into ""The Hermit"" archetype. I'm afraid of being alone, but I push people away when they get too close.

So, when my last girlfriend broke up with me for my various BPD tendencies, I started dating again within about a month. It should probably be noted at this point that the girl I'd been dating and I were engaged to be married about two months after we broke up.

So, I'm in a new relationship now, and have been dating this girl for around two months now. She spent the night the other night, and I let slip out that I felt that I was falling in love with her. We both know that the other has a personality disorder, but we don't know what the other's is. We decided to tell the other when we were comfortable with it, and I'm fine with that.

So, today we started talking more about our feelings for one another. She started, and said ""I guess that my feelings for you are excitement, lust, and hope for the future.""

I was devastated, because she didn't say that she loved me. I responded in kind by saying that the three strongest feelings I had for her were ""Love, adoration, and hope for the future.""

She's recently out of a failed marriage, so I understand that there's a reason that she doesn't want to let herself fall in love, but it does hurt me pretty badly that my feelings aren't reciprocated.


Note: I put ""love"" in quotation marks because I've had family members tell me that people with BPD are incapable of loving. I don't know how you guys feel about it, but there it is."
do,"The break up was a bit more than a year ago and we both did some shitty things to each other (2+ year relationship).  She hurt me pretty badly, but after growing up some more I've realized a lot of my own transgressions.  She really didn't want anymore contact at the time, so although I feel a big desire to say a short apology, I worry about whether hearing from me would hurt her.  It was an intense relationship for both of us.  Nothing seriously bad like cheating happened, but feelings were very badly hurt.  I would love to apologize if it would help, but I don't want to disrespect her request for no contact, especially because I did the opposite at the beginning.  But after a year of growth, I wonder if now would be an alright time."
do,"I have a GTX 660 running on driver software 359.06, for about 2 months everything ran okay up until I tried to update it (I used DDU to uninstall my driver) to the latest driver 358.39, but after a wave of BSOD's I decided to uninstall the driver (Again using DDU) and just go back to my old driver, even deleting the Vulkan software it installed.

For two days ever since I've had BSOD issue after BSOD issue; I've noticed if I have a YouTube video playing it'll crash my browser (Firefox), if I try to load up a game (Such as WarThunder or something else) it'll crash as well, sometimes a BSOD other times just automatic restarts.

I went through Bluescreenview and I could not make what's causing the problem, I used WhoCrashed which analysed all of my crash dumps but only one of the 20 or so came back pointing to athwnx.sys, which is some network adapter. All of my other MiniDump files come back with nothing. 

I'm incredibly unsure at this point, I had a BSOD no longer than 10 minutes ago which seems to of deleted my login information on a number of sites, I've ran two virus scans and nothing has turned up.

I'm either thinking it's a driver issue or just some sort of hardware issue, I had something similar happen before which fixed itself once I turned the computer plug off at the wall after turning everything off, after that everything went back to normal. I'm really not sure why after trying to update my driver software now everything's gone balls up. I've never overclocked the system, it has been running absolutely good up until I tried to update it.

Good for you lady. Taking a picture of the horrible young lady. Giving her passive aggressive insults. Ignoring her when she tries to explain herself. Because in all of your years you've learned that it's better to act like a cunt then to actually talk it out with a person. 

Look, I get what it looks like. But it wasn't. Maybe she was trying to get my attention in the beginning but thought I was ignoring her. I know its hard for people as ancient as her to see the wires of ear buds.

do,"*PREFACE*

Thousands of years ago, on the continent of Illiria, the first human King, Skaldor the Conquerer, came to power. He waged a long and bloody war against his fledgling nation's neighbors, those forest folk of the Sylvan Alliance. In his bid for power, in his attempt to eradicate a vastly larger and vastly superior force, he sought out 144 entities and commissioned the creation of 144 artifacts of wondrous powers. This artifact was created by the Guardian, the Human God of family, home, bountiful harvests, and those who have no voice.

*DESCRIPTION*

The Tears of the Guardian are a collection of magically created ponds of salt water, near the Kuastan coast and the grand city of Coppershore. The seventeen small ponds form the shield sigil that signifies the Guardian, and each pond is a light shade of tan with a liquid metal sheen, giving the appearance of liquid copper. The grass that grows in the area turns white over time, growing in such a way as to leave a path around the glorious ponds.

*POWERS* 

The Tears of the Guardian can be used to grow crops to an impressive yield, and being baptized in the salt ponds might protect a righteous man from evil. Those who pray here in desperate need of help will often find the help they need.


*THE SYLVAN WAR*

Skaldor prayed himself for thirty three days at the beginning of the conflicts that would become the Sylvan War. The Guardian believed his worshippers to be pure, for they had provoked no violence before the conflicts began. Skaldor prayed for the safety of his smallfolk, and for the coming storm to spare their crops so they might eat in these times of strife. It is written that Skaldor received a vision of the marshlands near Coppershore, and he set off to see if his prayers had been answered. 

He found the Tears of the Guardian in all their glory, a dangerous bog  transformed into a symbol of divine protection. Clerics from each settlement in Skaldor's small kingdom would gather here, and be baptized in the light of the Guardian. Those who truly believed could drink of the salt water without harm, and a field sprinkled with it would grow tall and healthy crops.

The Guardian was pleased at first that his children could grow and be safe, and Skaldor's men bravely defended their borders.

But they didn't stop there.

With the Artifacts in hand, Skaldor led his men beyond the beaches of his small nation, into the great forests that cover most of Illiria. They committed atrocities, and the Guardian was appalled that his holy name could be used by such bloodthirsty, violent men.

And he wept. He wept, and he wept.

The rains came down on the realms of men, the Tears being flooded from a swelling river.

It is said that no one died from the rising waters, but the Tears were lost under the whitewater swell. 

Skaldor lost the protection of his God, but the people under his rule did not suffer. 


*TODAY*

Coppershore prospers, safely out of control of the Empire.

Noblemen and soldiers do not pray to the Guardian, for they receive no protections or boons from him. Common folk worship the Guardian reverently, for he makes sure they do not starve.

The Tears themselves still exist under the whitewater, the copper saltwater hidden under the river, appropriately named Wrath of the Righteous. It is said that one with the blessing of the Guardian, a man truly pure of heart, will one day raise the Tears to the surface, bringing on an endless age of peace and prosperity. There are those, whoever, who sadly shake their heads at the children's stories and say that the bloodshed will never end."
do,"I know I'm not active on this thread but I've been thinking about the passing of Chester since it occurred. I felt I should say something but wasn't sure where (and I'm not sure that this is the place but it's where I'm doing it). 

I grew up dealing with childhood trauma, depression and anxiety, that later manifested into a lot of unhealthy behaviors. I was hospitalized for mental health reasons in high school and twice in graduate school. I attended graduate school for Social Work. I wanted to work with kids who had experienced trauma. I feel an immense need to thank Linkin Park, and especially Chester for the impact they had on me when I was younger and as I've grown into myself more. 

Chester was honest about his pain and struggles, and despite losing his fight to those struggles, I still see him as a huge beacon of hope. I am immensely grateful to Chester and Linkin Park for unknowingly supporting me through multiple inpatient hospitalizations and on a day to day basis just trying to make it through. Linkin Park showed me how to have hope and dreams worth chasing despite the pain, you made me believe it could be better.

You've given me the gift of understanding empathy, validation, and feeling connected when I couldn't feel that from anyone else. 
I am so thankful that I made it through to be able to help others on a day to day basis with things I understand struggling with. 

I am sincerely just so grateful for everything Linkin Park has given me throughout my life. I wouldn't be where I am without you and I will always be the person who cares if one more light goes out, and will always work to prevent that from happening. 

Thank You."
do,"So I've been lurking around r/keto for a few days now reading the FAQs and looking at your delicious recipes, when I finally decided I'll give it a shot. I logged into my old MyFitnessPal account (which has gone untouched for some 10 months) to update my goals and was shocked to realize that I've gone back up to my starting weight over a year ago (I had lost about 15 pounds on a conventional diet--only limiting calories). I'm hoping this is the kick in the pants I need (that and the fact that I literally only have one fitting pair of pants remaining) to get going on this new diet, because clearly a conventional diet is NOT sustainable on any sort of long term for me.

My only real concern is starting this around the Holiday season : ( Bad timing. Goodbye, delicious potatoes and stuffing!"
do,"I've been talking about this with a lot of people, but for some reason, it's still hard to put it into words with a post. I guess the best place to start is last summer, when I started therapy. I was diagnosed with depression pretty quickly, but I was uncomfortable taking medication. No problem, says Bob (my therapist), I can help you beat this without drugs, but it'll be harder.

He wasn't joking. The past four months have more or less been hell. I wasn't sleeping. I wasn't going out and doing anything - I spent nearly all my time at work, or school, or in my apartment. I was missing classes and missing shifts and not always even being able to call in for the latter. I managed to keep my part-time job and keep my head afloat in a single class, but it wasn't easy, it wasn't pretty, and not all aspects of my life went so well. I wasn't taking care of myself - the apartment I was more or less sharing with my girlfriend was filthy, our relationship was going downhill fast, and my normally hyperactive sex drive was more or less nonexistent.

The relationship is worth more discussion, because my girlfriend (our one-year anniversary came about a month before I started therapy) was, for a long time, the only thing holding me together. I'd come home from a shitty day, and she'd cuddle me and make it less shitty. Not better - nobody could have done that - but less shitty. It wasn't a healthy relationship for a long time, though. I wasn't capable of doing my part in ANY way, because the depression was just screwing me up that badly. Every single ounce of energy I had was going towards trying to get my head on straight and trying not to have my life utterly collapse out from under me while I did so, and there wasn't any left for her.

I wasn't dating a complete pushover, and she didn't like that, and we fought a lot, but we weren't communicating well (one of us was depressed) and so the fights weren't often on topic. We were also both very reluctant to break up with the other, me because I was basically using her as a lifeline (and yes, I feel guilty about that) and her because of past problems that aren't my story to tell. So things kept going downhill, because it was an unhealthy relationship and it wasn't ending. Finally, things came to a head last week. She cheated on me with a friend of hers.

Since I'm a terrible storyteller, I'm going to add an aside about how therapy worked for me here. Basically, the psychologist I've been seeing (who I found through Psychology Today's listings, in case anyone needs help finding one, and who was open to helping me regardless of financial situation, though my parents gave me some help there) is what's known as a cognitive behavioral therapist. I told him all about what was happening and how I was feeling, and he would ask me about how I was thinking. Once he had a good picture of my mental processes, we talked a lot about how many of them were not only inaccurate but self-defeating, and how I wasn't thinking about life in a wholly realistic way. He gave me a lot of help replacing those with more realistic, positive, and healthy ones, and those processes slowly got better, but it took time, and even once I'd made significant improvement there things weren't really getting better in terms of how I felt emotionally. It got to the point where even though I wasn't comfortable going on meds, I was seriously contemplating it because I was sick of feeling bad and wanted to do something about it.

Anyway, so my girlfriend cheated on me, six days ago, and thankfully called me directly afterwards to tell me about it. Then the weirdest thing happened. I felt hurt, sure, and I felt REALLY disappointed in her, because she's better than that. But it didn't crush me. It didn't make me feel horrible. I was able to keep functioning, even though I felt really hollow inside and frankly not very great at all. I told her I was breaking up with her but that I didn't hate her or want her to feel horrible, hung up the phone, and went to talk to a few friends about it online.

The rest of that day...was rough. I had a ton of stress in my life already, but thankfully no school or class that day. I ended up going over to my mom's house to help her with something, and I ended up briefly in tears a couple of times. But I got through it, I went home at the end of the day and I got a good night's sleep. I woke up the next morning feeling better, but still rough, so I called in to work sick (feeling bad about that, of course, mainly because I've done it so much thanks to the depression) and stayed home.

That day was better, though. I started feeling a little better. I realized consciously how unhealthy our relationship had been, and that I was honestly a little glad to be out of it. That made me feel a little guilty, but I'd made a lot of progress in therapy, and I kept telling myself that feeling guilty over how I felt was unproductive, that wallowing in guilt wasn't solving anything, and that the best thing I could do was just accept things for the way they were and move on in a healthy fashion. And the strangest thing is that it actually worked. Not just in terms of convincing myself that that was the case - for a while, I'd been getting that far, but it wouldn't make me feel better, and then I'd feel even worse that it wasn't working. It actually improved my emotional state. I did a bit of cleaning, I got back in touch with some friends I hadn't talked to in way too long. I made a profile on OKCupid, because I realized that I wanted to meet new people and I was told by people I trust that that was legitimately a good way to do that for the socially-adept-but-currently-withdrawn.

The next day, Sunday, I woke up feeling all right. Not good - I hadn't woken up feeling good, or had a day that I felt good for the majority of, in months - but neutral, which is nice enough when you're used to feeling like shit all day. And that stayed with me all day. I did a bit more cleaning. I made some plans with friends and with strangers online. I stayed in control of my thoughts, and managed to delete some compromising photos of my girlfriend and myself from my phone without feeling awful or collapsing or contemplating doing anything less than completely honorable. The last, thankfully, is par for the course, but the first two are completely unprecedented in recent history.

Then monday came. I woke up early - which never happens - and the strangest thing was that I woke up feeling GOOD. Actively optimistic, happy to greet the day, looking forward to class (there's this cute girl...) and even to work to some extent. And by the time I was on the way to class, I realized something. A redditor I know, who was depressed and on medication, had described the day he started taking meds as waking up and going ""oh hey, this is how OTHER people see the world!"" Monday was that turnaround day for me.

Since then, things have kept going well. I'm feeling actively good about myself, and I have been consistently throughout. I'm staying in control of my thoughts and emotions when bad things happen and looking on the bright side. I'm keeping up with all my responsibilities. I have an active social calendar planned - this weekend is going to be crazy in the best way. My therapist thinks I've made legitimate progress that's core to who I am as a person and is talking in terms of seeing me less often unless things turn back around. And the part that made me want to post here is, it hit me more or less out of nowhere. Therapy helps, guys, and I heartily recommend it. I've heard that drugs help, but they weren't for me, and I now have proof that that's okay. But the most important thing is, if you can't see a light at the end of the tunnel, don't get discouraged, because a week ago, I was feeling shitty and didn't see myself feeling better any time soon. Today, I'm feeling awesome and a trained professional thinks I'm likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future.

Feel free to ask me anything, or share stories, or whatever you like. While I'm here, I'd like to thank a very special redditor, mbingo, who provided me with help in the form of pizza and being an incredibly fucking kind human being on two separate occasions while things were bad. To those of you who are here to help out others, not get help, you really are that awesome. It is impossible to overstate how much a random act of pure kindness and generosity can help someone in a bad spot get through the day. I love you all.

Thanks for reading.

EDIT: Holy crap, this got long. TL;DR: Bad stuff has been happening, but therapy helped, and so I'm dealing with it constructively, and doing that has turned my emotional life around and has more or less cured my depression, or at least the way it used to cripple me."

do,"... Without alienating really good matches.

OK, I generally think I'm pretty good at tindering and stuff, and I consider myself bisexual, but I have a pretty narrow scope of women that I'm attracted to. I've only seen a few really great physical/intellectual matches these sites (86% on okc!). 

So because I know that these women are good matches and starting conversations seems to be the most difficult hurdle (waiting for the other person to start), I message first. We have a lot in common, well educated, etc. Then it's, ""you're a catch, but too young"" (then why are you looking at people my age?). Just as a side-note: I look young for 25, but I'm pretty mature.

I actually just recently matched with this person again on tinder, so it isn't really a fluke they are attracted, and interested in people my age. I messaged something harmlessly flirty and related to her one sentence bio, and she then changed her bio... And no response. I waited a day and mentioned an activity that I was going to do myself that she might find fun too (based on her pictures, she's sporty).  Unmatched.

I guess this just happens when I, perhaps try too hard, but it is hard because there are so few people that I feel are good matches nearby, and I don't get this issue with guys because the onus of the conversation is usually put on them. 

I feel like I close off similarly when people don't broach subjects like I'd ideally like them to, but coming from this side, it sucks trying to reach out to someone who you feel like you could really connect with but you're trying to kick-start something that requires a bit of give and take, and you're left hanging.

Unfortunately I'm horrible at talking to women in any social setting. I have no confidence at all in myself and my looks, job keeps me isolated from meeting people, and kind of in a new city (moved back home after college but live on the opposite side of the city from where I grew up). 

Recently I met a girl and we have a lot in common. She was awesome to talk to and the first girl I've really connected to in about 2 years. All of a sudden she stopped talking to me as much and seemed distant. Just talked to her today and she said she's too busy in her life right now to be with someone. This shit always happens to me.

do,"Hi /r/motorcycles,

Another noob post. I don't know anything about motorcycles really, but one day I decided I wanted one. I was browsing on craigslist and found a 1988 Kawasaki Eliminator 250 for sale for 200 bucks. I looked into it a little bit, thought what the hell and offered 160 for it, which the guy took. The ad told me that the bike needed a carb cleanup, a new battery, and a new gas tank. The gas tank on the bike had a huge hold in it, and was so full of bits of rust that it could of been used as a maraca. The guy had taken the battery off at some point, so no battery came with the bike. Everything else seemed to be in good working order, although the guy suggested I replace the front tire sometime soon. It had been in storage for a few years, kept outside but under a cover. I just have a few questions for you guys;

1) Before I put money into a battery and new gas tank, is there anything I can do to get the bike running? I have a gas tank from an old lawn mower and have the petcock (just had to look up the name for that one) off of the old tank. Could I maybe jury rig the mower tank to my bike and maybe use a car battery or something to start it? Probably a stupid question. I'm a broke college student that just wanted a motorcycle to learn how to fix up, maintain, and of course ride. I've got the drive to learn how to get this qt poppin, just no knowledge.

2) How difficult would it be to clean the carb itself? I've heard it's pretty doable and that getting a mechanic to do it would be pretty spendy. I'll honestly be happy to get this bike fully working for under $500, but right now I only have about a hundred left. 

3) If you were in my shoes, what would you do to get it back to its former glory? In what order would you deal with certain parts/elements? I don't know the first thing to getting these things road-ready, so any guidance would be great.

4) If you know anything else about the eliminators or my model (88 EL250) specifically, I'd appreciate any specs, experience, or opinions any of you might have. 

tl;dr trying to get my cheap bike running, looking for any advice on doing that and/or anything about my bike I should know.

I'll be watching youtube videos and trying to learn more about this stuff, but I thought I'd try reddit first and see what you guys have to offer. I have some photos if you guys want but I wasn't sure about the rules so I didn't bother. Haven't been on reddit since the heydays of r/dogecoin, back in high school. Those were good times.

do,"I realize this is quite a controversial topic due to the all the conspiracy theories &amp; propaganda involved etc (which is what I want to try and cut though). 
I am honestly wondering what rough percentage of European academics/thinkers were Jewish during this period (30 %? etc). I also wonder what the reason behind this is. Is it down to a combination of factors such as primarily residing in towns/urbanized environments which are the areas of high culture linked with universities &amp; centers of trade etc, ostracisation on religious grounds leading the group to focus on methods of making a living in the urban environment like banking and the like, possibly creating a sort of quasi upper middle urban class heavily populated by Jews? To add to that, I read that there was a sort of population explosion among Jews in the late 19th century that would coincide with all this. To add to this, I am not entirely sure if I have a cognitive bias in the sense that I may be consciously picking out the jewish academics and not noticing the heavy contributors of other classes/groups. If this is the case what other groups/classes were heavily influential in this period regarding academics/business .

The story is pretty long, as it covers these 3 failed trips. I've added my thoughts at the end. If you have any useful insight, please share it!

**STORY:**

The first time I took it by myself, with two of my friends (Eddie and Billy) there with me. We were all pretty hyped but after a couple of hours and no sign of major symptoms (apparently ""you just know"" when you're tripping balls), we concluded that it must've been a dud. Bad luck, but shit happens!

The next day, Eddie suggested we try again together, with Steve (the guy who'd provided the tabs but who we'd only recently met). I realised that not leaving enough time between trips would mean that the effects would be lessened by increased tolerance, but I was really hoping that I'd at least be able to have a proper trip this time. How wrong I was...

The fly in the ointment was that after 3 hours, I still hadn't started tripping and was close to giving up. I smoked a joint with Steve and was starting to feel something, but then all of a sudden Eddie told us that he had been having an intensely bad trip all this time. We had been chilling in the park, enjoying the nice weather, etc. but I decided that it'd be better if we walked back to my flat and help Eddie through his trip. 

I could feel myself starting to become anxious, trying to tell a reluctant Steve that we needed to relocate. I've never been good at taking charge of social situations, particularly with people I don't know well, so naturally was quite uncomfortable. Eventually we managed to find our way back to my room, where Eddie collapsed on a beanbag and then quickly excused himself to have a pee. 

We decided to message Billy to come over and help, as he hadn't dropped. After a while I went through to the bathroom, to find that Eddie was having a full-blown mental breakdown - he made allusions to suicidal thoughts and having an existential crisis, and beneath my calm exterior I was panicking. 

I'm relieved to say that I managed to calm him down and bring him back into the living room. The rest of the evening felt like a new chapter, but I still didn't have the tripping experience I had hoped for. I decided that this was probably because I had to deal with a socially and emotionally challenging situation. I don't know whether that's a fair conclusion to reach, but I'm quite certain that I wasn't tripping during any of it.

Nearly 2 weeks later, Billy decided he wanted to trip, so I decided this might be a good opportunity. Third time lucky, etc.

Again, Billy (just like Eddie had) came up within the first 30 minutes, describing the feeling of ""ascension,"" while I felt entirely rooted in the ground. It was around about the same time after we first dropped (about 3 hours) that I started smoking and then things took a turn for the worst. 

Billy and I seemed to be quite aware of the energy in the room, which didn't seem to last more than 10 minutes at a time before he decided to change what we were doing (e.g. listening to music, then watching videos, then flickering the lights in the bathroom, etc). As I've mentioned before, I have social anxiety and so was very aware of this odd social environment. Usually I'm really comfortable around Billy - he's one of my best friends - but I was starting to get in my head, just like last time during Eddie's breakdown.

He then had an emotional breakdown as well, telling Eddie (who had been trip sitting) and I about some of his repressed traumas from his childhood. I'm generally a really empathetic guy, so this triggered a response in me. He pulled through and we settled for watching a cute Japanese film (*Spirited Away* - if you haven't watched it, you absolutely need to!)

**MY THOUGHTS:**

- If I didn't trip on these 3 occasions, does that mean that I need to try a higher dose (&gt;200ug)?
- Should I try tripping by myself again, so that I don't become so affected by someone else's negative experience?
- I heard that acid, unlike weed, doesn't exacerbate existing anxieties - should I avoid smoking when I next trip, to reduce the chances of becoming uncomfortable?
- Is it possible that on all 3 occasions I had a dud tab? It seems improbable but not impossible.
- Would my anxiety/emotions on the second and third trips really have prevented me from tripping? 
- And finally, if I *was* tripping, how could I have not noticed it? Were my friends wrong when they said, ""you just know""?"

3) is it a dog friendly city?
4) anyone ever been to Jefferson Community College? If so, how was it?

Thank you in advance!"
do,"I just got rejected for a scholarship - there were two reviewers and one thought my application was great but the other one thought my project was too ambitious and they didn't believe I was capable of doing it. Also they gave me 15/20 for my project being relevant, and they didn't say why but my project isn't about a commercially exploited or charismatic species and I was afraid that would put me at a disadvantage. The other reviewer specifically said that they thought my project was valuable and shouldn't be overlooked just because it wasn't about something more... IDK sexy or whatever.

It wouldn't bother me so much except someone I know won the same award last year (I don't know how many people applied last year; they gave it to the top 24/98 this year) and this student has no idea what they're doing. And I've seen their writing and there's no way their application was better-written than mine.

On the one hand, I guess I should have put in more about how I'm going to do the data analysis, though I was right up to the word limit so I would have had to sacrifice information in another section.

And on the other hand, that really pisses me off that they basically thought ""the average student in this program isn't computer-literate enough to pull this off, so I'm going to assume this student isn't.""

There are deadlines for some more scholarships coming up in February and now I'm really discouraged about applying for those. My project is about something most people have never even heard of and I feel like it's an uphill battle to convince people it's worthwhile, and that I have the molecular bio and programming background to handle the bioinformatics part.

So, words of encouragement please?"
do,"So yeah, yesterday the sirens went off and we had to take shelter.

Poseidon was a little stressed out, but once I was able to get him back in his tank I threw a blanket over it and he calmed right down. Once in the shelter I put my bag between the two carriers so they wouldn't see each other. They were little celebrities in the community shelter. :)

do,"What I'm about to post is not the easiest thing to talk about, but it needs to be known. The rest of my family already knows. The relationship with my father has never been a good one. He believed that beating up on a child was the best discipline. Having privileges taken away &amp; stuff like spankings are ok, not what I personally would do as that never worked on me, but that's beside the point. 

My father always felt the need to punch me, kick me, throw objects at me (knives being one such thing) and say emotionally hurtful things to me to get his point across. He would say things like ""you're useless, worthless and will never be anything in life."" If I brought home a bad grade in school it would result in a beating so bad I couldn't sit down for a week. He once hit me in the head with a shovel while raking snow when I lived in Michigan. I still have the scar of that to this day. 

He wasn't too happy when I came out as Gay either, but he put up with it for a while, but as of February 2016 he had had enough of it and basically attacked me for being Gay and he said I would go to hell. I haven't spoken to him since and have no desire to really. He is one of the reasons that I have trust issues. I'm afraid that friends will abandon me, that I'm not liked by anyone just because of the hurtful words he had said to me growing up. 

To those who have a loving father consider yourselves lucky as it is one thing I wished that I could have had. I am however glad that I have a Grandaddy who thinks the world of me despite the fact that we argue a lot."
do,"it be a long one but please read.
It's been about a week now, everything has been 'normal.' He looks like my father, talks like my father, acts like my father but I am still scared he is not my father.


A bit of background information: when I was four and my sister was seven my parents divorced. My mother took my sister and moved to the other side of Canada (country I live in) meanwhile me and my father stayed in British Columbia. I am eighteen now and female, I get a birthday card and christmas card every year other than that I dont hear much from my mother and sister. So turning to them for help is not really an option. In turn I am very close with my dad. My dad split our house up since I became an adult, I live in the basement and he lives upstairs. 


Our house layout (only whats relevant): The door separating his space from mine has five steps coming down from it leading to the entrance way. The front door is next to the garage door and if you turn around you will see the stair case leading into the basement.


About a week ago I was laying in bed and it was around two thirty in the morning. My dad is a truck driver and heads to work at this time every morning. So quietly I waited to hear the usual sounds I do when he is getting ready/leaves for work. But something strange happened,  I heard all the regular sounds but they were different? As if they were glitching out. I'll explain:


First the creaking of his bed (his bedroom is right above mine) even that sounded a little off. My father is a very vocal man usually he yawns or sighs in the morning but I didn't hear that. Just the quick creaking as if he hastily climbed out of bed. Which is odd because he never flies out of bed at two am. Then his foot steps, usually they are heavy and solid. (He's about 5""11 190 lbs) But that morning they were lighter, as if he was trying to be quiet. (Which he never tries) They also seemed to drag on the floor, being an avid /r/nosleep reader I was already terrified. 


He went into the bathroom, instead of hearing the toilet, I heard the shower turn on at its highest pressure for about a minute and thirty seconds and then turn off. The foot steps still dragging and light entered the kitchen. I heard him punching numbers into the microwave but when it turned on it whined loudly and sounded staticy? (sorry for the spelling) Which freaked me out even more because i know sometimes electronics mess up around the paranormal. It dinged and I heard him slam whatever he was making onto the counter. Then silence. 


The door separating me from him creaked open slowly. And the sound of a key ring with a hundred big keys on it crashing to the stairs was heard. After it sounded like more keys were being thrown onto the stairs then as if he had put his feet on them and was sliding across the stairs onto the entrance way like that. It was a ear piercing scraping sound, the garage door not the front opened abruptly and I heard the sound of screws or nails or something hitting the concrete floor. The door slammed shut and the front opened with a groan. Hesitantly I called out to him like I do every morning:


 ""Have a good day at work dad, I love you"" I suddenly felt the feeling I was being watched and felt sick to my stomach and light headed. All I heard was a laugh. (Looking back I wish I didn't call out to him because I don't think whatever is in my house now knew I was there till then) It wasn't my dad's normal laugh. Sounded like his voice but not his laugh. The front door slammed shut and I heard his big dodge roar to life then peel out of the drive way.


I went upstairs to see if the truck was gone and if he had left, his room was empty and the truck was gone. I went back to bed figuring it was all in my head. The next morning I went upstairs to make breakfast. When suddenly my dad's bedroom door opened and out walked my father. Upon seeing him I looked out the window, there was no truck outside still. I didn't even returning his greeting I just said:


 ""Where is your truck dad?"" 
""Getting a tune up"" he smiled. (My dad is a bit of a tough lover he doesn't just smile at me for no reason)
""When did you take it in because I saw it when I came home from work last night?""
""You must have thought you saw it there, I took it in while you were at work."" He smiled again. I packed up my breakfast and drove to the library and just sat in there for most of the day because I didn't know what to do.


It's been a week now, his truck reappeared on the third day. No strange noises, he hasn't gone to work it could be his days off. He looks, talks and kinda acts like my dad but I can't help shake the creepy feeling I get every time he talks to me. 


Please help, was my dad taken by something? Is this what /r/nosleep calls a doppleganger? what can I do from here? My 'dad' hasn't been aggressive just super friendly all week. I want my dad back. 


edit: forgot to mention I asked him about when he left for work that night and the strange noises he heard he claims he was in bed all night and I was hearing things. But I know what I heard."

do,"I meet a lot of wonderfully fascinating people every day at work. I am a cashier at a retail store in a city with a large military base, so nearly all of my customers are either active duty, dependents, or veterans.

Any time a customer says, ""Have a blessed day!"" I say, ""Thank you, you too!"" and just smile. It's a genuine sentiment, and my return is just as sincere. And with the ""Merry Christmas!""es, too - I don't care what you call it. Most people around here celebrate Christmas, so I've been cheerfully wishing people a Merry Early Christmas here and there too.

Today though, one of my customers (an older gentleman, a retired veteran) told me about this song that is now available online that says something to the effect of ""If the store's window doesn't say Merry Christmas keep right on going"" and how it was available online. He said, ""Do ya know what I mean?"" with a grin - and I said, ""Well, I celebrate Festivus."" with just as big of a grin.

Of course he had no idea what I meant, but it kinda felt good to acknowledge and embrace my nonbelief at work, where many of my coworkers are outwardly religious (one said things about how excellent ""He"" is while pointing up at the ceiling when I responded that I was having a fantastic day - she went on for a good minute or two!, wearing cross necklaces, telling customers to be blessed or have a blessed day without prompt, etc.) and I'll admit, I'm a wee nervous about even hinting that I'm an atheist, as I am pretty sure that it is assumed I'm also a Christian, just by the way I act.

Which, in a way, makes me proud... but also a little disappointed in myself! On one hand, I don't think that religion or politics has a place in the workplace, so I don't want to open up that can of worms, but on the other hand... at least half of my coworkers openly celebrate their religion every day at work. -sigh-

PS: I think [this is the song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln01p1M2cH0) my customer was referring to."

do,"It's a really complex situation, but I'll try to write down a basic summary. I am suffering through multiple mental health problems such as depression, paranoia, anxiety, and possibly ADHD or Autism Spectrum (diagnosed age 5), the latter I am re-evaluating because it sounds sketchy. I know case managers don't baby their clients, but seeing myself having one makes me feel really uncomfortable, mainly because it makes me feel inferior compared to most people. I also want to work independently on my own because that will ensure that I can be competent and successful in the real world without any extra help (if I can find stability and competence in the external world). The problem is that I've been living in a bubble for 7 years (borderline agoraphobia since age 15 and homelessness from ages 12-15) so I have had no real world experiences, like a job, or even getting my permit. But that may be reflective of my mental health issues. If I overcome them and stabilize, I can see myself doing well in the external world. I tried telling my mother that but it seemed clear that she was really concerned about me. She does have financial issues of her own, and she feels like she needs to support me and teach me about the real world, and since she is having difficulty doing that, she got me the case manager, which I denied for the main reason that I stated above. I haven't proven my abilities yet, so I don't see any reason for having a case manager right now, even though on paper, I apparently have a ""disability"". Then my mother told me ""I blew it, I probably would live with her for the rest of my life, and I made her look stupid in front of the case manager.""

This triggers my skeptical thinking even more, since I'm a fuckin idiot. I also don't like letting my emotions affect my decision making but if I did accept this case manager it would affect my self esteem greatly, and make me feel even more inferior, which would demotivate me to an extent. It is my life after all. Did I make a stupid move? I need to talk to somebody about all of this right now, so I wanted to ask this question."
do,"Hello! I got my nexplanon inserted 5 days ago. My doctor gave me some spare steri-strips because it seemed like I would bleed through the ones she put on me (she was correct) and said to change them if I needed to. After 24 hours I changed the strips and placed a new bandaid on, which I turned out to be allergic to. I had to place some anti-itch cream to the area around the steri-strips because my arm had a large bandaid-shaped welt. The cream got underneath the edges of the steri-strips and caused them to come up, but the middle part is still staying over the insertion site.

I taped the edges back down with a small square of medical tape because I don't want the strips to come off too early, as it has only been 5 days. I'm just curious as to how long you all kept your steri-strips on or how long it took for them to fall off? I don't want mine to come off to early is all."

I have been fortunate enough to find a beautiful and sweet Pitbull/boxer/retriever mix. He’s 7 years old, recently neutered, and a total bundle of joy. Loves playing, is independent, and calm as can be. I’ve visited him at the pound three times now and getting ready to adopt him.

My question is with regards to some questions I’ve been getting from my landlord. I sent him my doggys health information/profile. A bit of backstory: my little boy was beaten as a puppy and attacked by two dogs. He has never counter attacked. He barely barks and has lived with other dogs, cats, ferrets, and small children prior to me adopting him with no issues. My landlord is worried that when he gets older he might become aggressive (as his brain degenerates). There were two pitbull attacks (of children, to death by pitties raises from birth) in my area and I think he is nervous. Any suggestions on how to emphasize that history over years is important and that this little man has not so much as growled?"

do,"OK, here's the story. 

I go into a interview and I get offered the position and the hours are 9 to 6 Monday through Friday and I am a Lead Teacher. For those who do not know what a lead teacher is; I am responsible for everyone and everything in the classroom. Decisions are made by me and me only.  With that said. 

Monday,  first day- I go in fill out necessary paperwork, make small tslk, go over procedures and what not. I take a full tour of the building and I see the room that will be mine. I go back to the office and I get to how a teacher and a assistant teacher list their credentials from not following protocol with regards to a child, however,  the situation has been handled and it's all good. 

Tuesday- in office again doing paperwork over heard director if the program talking about the incident that she told me yesterday.  A boy fell and hit his head, neither the teacher nor assistant teacher notified the parent nor the director at the time. Later on in the day the kid hits his head again yet no one is notified. Later on in the day that same boy begins to seize. Instead of clearing the area THEY FUCKING MOVE HIM  and bring him to the then director and the parent has finally been notified. The father got a lawyer who got a judge to issue a subpoena as to what happened that day. As a professional that is insanely scary to hear. The place is under a legal investigation and the two morons who caused all this are still employed their hence being a liability.  The director knowing that I heard clarified that I was hired to clean up the mess. 

Wednesday- as if the crap from the day before wasn't enough to send me running..... I'm in the office again doing paperwork and I ask do I get a I-9 form. The director said that I would. Then she tells me that she can't hire me as full time and only part time, yet my hours are 9 to 6, 5 days a week. She said in order to be full time I must average 30 or more hours a week for 2 months before they can change my status. Here's the kicker;  part time does NO benefits. 

Thursday- I take off and go on two interviews.  (Wish me luck). 

Friday- I ask when I will be able to get into my room. I get told once I'm credentialed. I asked how long that would take and I got told from a week to a few months..... I go into the classroom where I thought I was just learning the ropes and the lead teacher in there tells me that she went into my room to get more bibs the day before. When she opened the sliding door rat shit fell out. And there were blankets with bite marks in them. Then she said that someone has to clean that up!!!! The ship was sitting in a classroom a whole day with people knowing already. 

The best is my classroom and this classroom are separated by a baby gate and we have infants on the floor.... 

Needless to say that I quit the job. 

But was I right to leave?

Edit: I called the NYS Department of Labor and they said essentially an employer can lie to you and there's nothing that they can do about it. I got a little smoking gun in the fact that I was hired for full time hours, yet receive a letter from the parent company advising me to go get ObamaCare through the NYS Marketplace.  What bs."

I was having an extremely rough day. Very very bad place this past week. I took 60mg of codeine (they were 4 years old) and alot of klonopin (I can't even remember how much) and some weed.

Ive taken opiates before mixed with benzos and never vomited, so it was probably cause of the old pills. It wasn't that bad, it was fast and I was calm because I was so high. I'm writing this post for myself to remember that vomiting isnt bad at all. 

and it's not cause of the amount of drugs, i've taken much more before and was completely free of nausea. mustve just been a bad pill.

Since being diagnosed, I have abstained from all substance use, and have been going to therapy. I had been going to therapy since I was in elementary school, but never opened up and really took advantage of it. In the past 6-8 months, however, I have made tremendous progress with therapy, and am really seeing results. I was also put on antidepressants (Prozac and Wellbutrin) which have greatly helped.  

Before I was diagnosed, I drank and used drugs quite a bit, however, it has been no problem abstaining entirely. 

In a few months, I will be moving to France for a year to work. Although I have been sober since my diagnosis, I never planned on making it a lifelong thing, was planning on being a light social drinker during my time in France. 

My parents told me recently that they do not support this. They want me to spend the next year sober (which would make about 18 months of total sobriety) to make sure my antidepressants are working well, and then I can return to alcohol in a safe environment with them close by. They have told me that they will not support me in any way if I do not remain sober for the next 12 months. 

Part of me wants to stay sober so that I can maintain a healthy relationship with them (something we have just recently started to have). The other part of me thinks that I would be missing out on some things if I did not drink for my entire year in France, and that another 12 months of sobriety is simply unnecessary.

Whenever I go to Target or Walmart I go to the toy section and just look at the display, and sometimes end up buying a few. I almost always go to self checkout when I do, because I don't really want the cashiers to suspect that they might be mine (even though friends have assured me that they probably won't). I bought a new doll last night and I am obsessed with it. She's one of the new curvy Barbies, and as soon as I saw her on the shelf I just wanted her. I haven't bought a new doll since March, but for some reason I couldn't resist. The self checkout wasn't open, so I grabbed some makeup products too just so I would feel more at ease. I even named her Violetta.

And yes, I still play with the dolls that I have. I dress them, brush their hair, carry them around like a child would, you name it. Violetta was on my pillow last night when I slept, and she's currently sitting on my bed now. I have a ""security teddy bear"" that I've had since age 5, but people seem to find that normal in comparison to the dolls. If I'm going to be away from home overnight, the teddy bear comes with me.

I experienced a short and mild depression, and have started to feel better a few days ago. While my emotions and energy are on the rise, my motivation is still at a low. Is this common? Any advice on how to handle this? (diagnosed ADHD)

**Wall of text:**

I've had bouts of depression in the past. At its worst I experienced suicidal ideation and fell behind with my studies (university). This year I was determined to make up for this. This went well for the first 2 months, but this came with a lot of stress.

I passed all classes that quartile (yay). At the beginning of the current quartile I found myself completely exhausted, and this began to take the shape of a mild depression. I once again began to fall behind in my classes.

A few days ago the self-loathing and general pessimism started to get better. My motivation however hasn't improved at all. I haven't been doing anything but the bare essentials/mandatory tasks (which is not nearly enough to keep up with classes). I compulsively escape to my hobbies in order to keep up my spirit.

My question: Is this common after a (mild) depression, low motivation but higher energy and spirits. Any advise?

do,"It seems the longer I live the more sad life becomes. I was diagnosed with PTSD and Major Depression a couple of years ago, stemming from a very rough childhood, along with more incidents in my earlier adult years. I also have no family to speak of, everyone that I thought cared about me turned out to be drug addicts who never had my best intentions in the first place. I have gotten help from a therapist and psychiatrist lately, but it doesn't seem to be helping anything. I'm too old to qualify for a lot of things...I don't have healthcare, work a dead-end job at Wal-Mart and my only friend struggles with mental illness, leaving me feel like I'm burdening said friend when I reach out for help.

I moved here to Marianna, FL a couple years back after a stint of trying to care for my brothers in Louisiana. We had all been in foster homes, I lucked out and was able to become independent quite early. My brothers, however, went through various mental institutions and were subjected to massive amount of abuse. Meanwhile, our Mom was up in Colorado somewhere doing her thing - doing meth and telling me that everything that happened to the family was ""my fault"". I haven't talked to her for about a decade since then. So, I was living in Louisiana with my own apartment and a stable job and decided that my brothers should not end up being screwed over by the foster care system. Keep in mind they both have significant mental illnesses, but I had also not physically seen nor talked to them for many years (they kept us 100% isolated from each other during foster care). I figured I was strong and stable enough to try to fix the situation, and invited them over to live with me. After numerous talks with them on the phone and the case counselors, I paid for their bus tickets, and they came in the summer of '09. 

At first, things went well. We did a lot of crying and hugging and talking about everything that had happened to us over the years. I also had to convince them that what happened was not my fault in any way. Our mother had convinced them that the family was torn apart by me somehow (probably from the night I called the police when she was jacked on meth and pointing a loaded shotgun at us. I was 14 at the time.) Slowly, over time, their trauma started to surface and signs started to slowly show. Anger towards me. Passive aggressive behavior. Waking up in the middle of the night to find one of them standing over me with a knife. I got them professional help, but it wasn't enough. The situation devolved into them becoming totally unmanageable...I had one working with me at the local factory but he lost his job due to refusing to go to work and told me that I was going to have to support him. My love for my brothers won out, I kept supporting them for another 6 months. Things just kept getting worse and worse...my neighbors started telling me I should watch my back because they were telling them they wanted to kill me. Everything came to a head, I came home from work one day to find out one brother had beaten another with a pipe and gone to jail. After he got out, I told them that I was too emotionally wracked and spent to support them any more. They resorted to blaming me for everything that had happened to them and decided they should move back in with their mother. I could not, as hard as I tried, convince them that it was the worst idea in the world. They had made up their minds though, and I spent the last of my money on their greyhound tickets to the mother in Colorado.

I was completely devastated at this point, emotionally and financially. I quit my job because I was having problems going to work on time and not falling apart constantly. A friend of mine offered to take me to Florida and help him set up a business fixing cars. I figured I needed to learn a skill of some kind (I ultimate figured myself to be a techie). 

I went, and long story short, he ended up closing the shop and being a complete asshole to me. I was homeless for a few weeks until I found work at a local factory that made textiles. After a few months everything seemed to be doing OK. Then, the shift I was on was laid off and I was homeless again. I wasn't meeting people or making friends at this point, I didn't trust anyone and was suffering from mentall illness I didn't even realize I had. I found a job working at McDonalds right before I was about to get kicked out of my trailer. Stayed there as a crew member for a few months, got promoted to a shift manager. Felt like I was doing OK, but then it started going bad again. The store manager used and abused me by working me long hours and generally being a huge ass. I found out he was an ex-felon and had a history of abusing employees, but as it was a franchise and Florida is an at-will employment state, there wasn't much I could do about it. The owners of the business knew this all too well. I bided my time until I found a cheap apartment in Marianna where there was a local community college. Moved there, and started working at a distribution center for Family Dollar. It was around the time I started working at McDonald's that I decided to get professional help for my mental problems. McDonald's was extremely stressful and wasn't helping in that department. Anyways, I worked at Family Dollar for awhile, trying to save up money. Unfortunately, I had a horrible episode of depression that lasted for a couple weeks. It culminated in me not being able to wake up for work anymore, I was literally sleeping about 18-20 hours a day. Called a friend I had made while working for McDonald's telling her I was coming very close to committing suicide. She took me to a CSU (crisis intervention unit) in Panama City. I thought it was a good idea, but it turned out to be a very bad one. I was basically locked into this tiny prison for 3 days, with barely a soul talking to me besides the mentally ill patients already there. Finally talked to the Psychiatrist but he didn't seem to care and upped my dose of Zoloft to 200mg a day. They released me, and I went back home. Was able to start working again, however I was still having extreme problems with sleeping and depression. Received a huge bill in the mail from the CSU ($3000+) and decided going back there was not an option. My counselor told me I should get a physical check up, I did and found out I had Hashimoto's disease. It's an autoimmune disorder that destroys your thyroid over time and causes symptoms like lack of energy, depression and other things. Was prescribed thyroid replacement pills and received yet another large medical bill. I need to mention that at this point I had already started going to my community college, but dropped out due to my mental and personal issues.

Fast forward to the present, I'm got hired at Wal-Mart in July and decided to give school another shot. I was betting on my hypothyroidism and depression being held in check enough to move forward with my life. However, I found out I owed $850 from my Pell Grant after dropping out. The college stopped accepting student loans altogether this year. The explanation is here: http://www.chipola.edu/financialaid/
I even tried applying for personal loans from various banks, I was denied each time for not having enough of a credit history, and lack of collateral (I only have an older car worth about $2k).

I'm now considering suicide more than ever. The only thing holding me back before was worry that I would hurt friends and family of mine. Now, however, it seems I am truly and utterly alone in this world. My family has abandoned me, I fucked up my chance at school, I work an extremely low paying job at Wal-Mart. What is really fucked up about all this is that I believe I truly have potential. No ego-trip here, but I know I'm fairly smart. I build computers as a hobby and want to make computer science my passion. Of course, this doesn't mean anything in the real world, hard work does. I can't even seem succeed in seemingly simple situations though.

I'm sorry if this whole rant came through garbled/intelligible. There were MANY MANY details I left out but it would be a literal 500+ page novel to write it all out. No tl;dr here...I just can't come up with one that expresses my feelings well enough. This is the first time I've told any of this to someone that I didn't trust explicitly. Hopefully someone that uses reddit has been through something similar and has some useful advice. Telling me to call a suicide hotline isn't going to help, tried that already and the disembodied voice that doesn't know me just makes it worse. I'm going to find an out either way. Either a financial way out of this mess or a much more permanent way ""out"". If you read through all this, thank you very much for your time, and good luck to anyone else out there suffering with mentall illness and/or lack of family support."

I was in the ER on November 19th for flu-like symptoms: 102.4 fever that had been around for three days, cough, high pulse (around 135), and 94 oxygen level. 

After negative flu and strep tests, many blood tests, a chest x-ray, urine sample, etc. I was diagnosed with pneumonia, given doxycycline, and sent on my way.

Today, the 28th, I'm feeling better. My fever broke on the 23rd and outside of feeling absolutely exhausted and still coughing, I feel much better today than I did at this time last week. 

However, my blood results have me intrigued. I've always had a theory that I have an autoimmune disorder because I've always had a pretty weak immune system. I got shingles when I was 11, had c-diff when I was 18, and now pneumonia at 23. I used to get a sinus infection every year in high school/college and had strep throat twice a year as a child. I once had a bizarre viral pinkeye on and off for three months. I've been the butt of sick jokes by my friends/family for years and years. 

I also suffer from frequent costochondritis flares that started over four years ago, have experienced Reynauld's phenomenon a few times, and have anxiety and depression. 

Ok, enough talking. Here are my blood results with references:

**Complete blood count with diff**  
WBC: 7.9 (4.5-11.0)  
RBC: 4.05 (4.00-5.20)  
**Hemoglobin: 11.9 (12.0-16.0)**  
Hematocrit: 36.0 (36.0-46.0)  
Platelet: 257 (150-450)  
  
**Differential**  
**% Neutrophils: 82.5 (40-70)**  
**% Lymphocytes: 9.8 (22-44)**  
% Monocytes: 7.4 (0-11)  
% Eosinophils: 0.0 (0-6)  
% Basophils: 0.3 (0-3)  
ABS Neutrophils: 6.5 (1.8-7.7)  
**ABS Lymphocytes: 0.8 (1.0-4.8)**  
ABS Monocytes: 0.6 (0.0-0.8)  
ABS Eosinophils: 0.0 (0-0.50)  
ABS Basophils: 0.0 (0-0.3)  
  
MCV: 88.9 (80.0-100.0)  
MCH: 29.5 (26.0-34.0)  
MCHC: 33.2 (31.0-37.0)  
RDW: 13.6 (11.5-14.5)  
**Mean Platelet Volume: 6.6 (7.4-10.4)**  
  
I also had a comprehensive metabolic panel. All of the numbers were within normal range except for these two:

**Globulin: 4.3 (2.3-4.0)**  
**AST (SGOT): 12 (15-40)**  

I was also told that my urine analysis revealed ketones of 160+ on the 19th. I have been told this in the past as well, though no one has ever explained to me why they are so high or if that is something I should be concerned about.

I have an appointment set up with my PCP for this Friday to get some more blood tests done. I'll probably ask her to do an ANA test as well. I was just curious to see what anyone here may think! Plus, I just like talking about blood results hahaha.

do,"Life can be weird sometimes. 

After 7 years, my old best friend comes back into my life after a falling out between us. We have been talking through what went wrong. He admitted he shouldn't have screwed me over and should have treated me with more respect. He also admitted that it took personal trauma and tragedy in his life to realise this. Things are looking great for our renewed friendship.

On the other hand, another close friend of mine seems to be ghosting me now. She came into my life when my friendship with my old best friend fell apart and she helped pick me up. Her and I were so close, we've been friends for 6 years and I think she may have liked me at one stage. Even from a huge distance (she's American and I'm Australian) we managed to keep a tight friendship. Over the past few months, she has barely messaged me. I've told her how important she is to me and she has done the same to me. It's just weird. I really hope I don't lose her :("

I look through TRP occasionally, and see some good advice, advice I can't put into practice because my mood constantly switches.

Before I tell you my fuck up, at the time I was on two medications, Pristiq and Lithium, an antidepressant, and a mood stabilizer.

So, as I was saying my mood switches all the time, and this time was really bad, I woke up one morning feeling bad, I felt like I wasn't good enough, so I told her I didn't want to be with her because I didn't feel good enough for her. She just brushed it off because she knew my mood was shit. The next day, I fucked some other girl, felt guilty then told her, she threatened to fuck her ex, and I said go for it. She then said she did, and I was angry- I told her to kill herself, she tried.

I feel like complete shit all the time because of this, I miss her, she was the only person that could deal with me, and I fucked it up. Now, I'm going to be alone, and because of my repetitive thoughts, I'm going to be thinking of her for the next 5 years, at least.

Much has changed, but so many of you did everything you could, many for the first election ever, to get Bernie Sanders elected as our nominee. Unfortunately, we fell short of our ultimate goal, but because of your hard work we have a large enough minority voice at the DNC that we can have a real impact on what happens there.

To me, representing the wishes of Bernie delegates obviously means casting a vote for him at the convention (already was ready to do this), but because this community brought so much to the conversation, i'm curious what you want of your delegates (I will definitely report back to other Bernie delegates) at the convention? What would make you feel most validated and/or proud of your Bernie delegates?

We've had various ups and downs in our relationship, all of the usual things that break hearts and bring people closer together and difficult life situations that we've been though as well.  We've also cheated on each other, and lied to each other about the cheating.  Everything is out in the open now, and has been for several months.  We have an amazing sex life, and I honestly couldn't ask for more.  

For the most part we are extremely happy.  However, I am making some major life changes and am moving across the country to pursue graduate school in the fall and he has decided not to move with me due to his work.  Right now we are planning on doing the ""wait and see"" thing, possibly trying an open relationship, possibly staying together, or possibly breaking up.  

My problem is that I am really struggling with feelings of jealousy and inadequacy.  He knows I struggle with intense jealousy, but it is really starting to get in the way of our relationship.  Just the thought of him being with another woman makes me want to be sick, and also makes me want to preemptively break up with him to avoid heartbreak.  However, at the same time, I am excited about the possibility of sleeping around, and would like to have casual sex with other men/explore my more exhibitionist side anonymously.     

Does anyone have any suggestions for helping me cope with my unfair and unrealistic feelings?  I am going crazy with jealousy and I feel terrible.  Actually, I feel like a pretty bad person for being so excited about the possibility of sleeping around and for being so frightened he will do the same.  I am sure that it is because of some immaturity on my behalf, but I could really use some advice.  I'd like to grow up but I don't know how.

Like stated, my boyfriend and I are traveling to Seoul for 7days for the first time!!!!!!!! We will be staying near Seoul station for the first few days and Gangnam Station for the rest of our trip :D 

We really like Korean food (some of our favorties are: Chimaek, Sundubu jjigae, samgyeopsal, budae jjigae) are there anything else that we should try out? Also, is live octopus/beondegi just a gimmicky thing for tourist? (we tried both of them once but they were just okay... wondering if its an actual thing in Korea)

Besides food, we also look forward to the nightlife in Seoul. We were thinking of going to Cakeshop in Itaewan (just found out that Anderson Paak. &amp; The Nationals will be there after we leave :'( ) are there any other clubs /bars that has a similar vibe to Cakeshop... (hiphop, trap, house, soulection...) 

Thanks for taking the time to read this! Sorry for bombarding you guys with questions! We will for sure look for more info as we plan our trip.

I've been going through severe depression for the past year, and didn't realize it. I was diagnosed finally in July and since then it has gotten a lot better with exercise and therapy. 

But this last week has been hard because we finally got to go on vacation as a family. 

The vacation part of it went great, but when we got home yesterday we were both so exhausted that I reverted to my old ways of thinking and reacting.

I also haven't exercised at all in the past few days.

And just now we had a huge fight because I interpreted something she said/did as if she was saying I was an incompetent father.

And she wasn't saying that and she wasn't mad at me, but that's how I interpreted it. But now she's mad at me for thinking that way about her and for even thinking that she could think that way about me. I'm fucked no matter what I do or how I think.

And she just had a panic attack because she feels like she already has a baby to take care of, and she can't take care of me too and now there's this new one on the way and she can't handle all of this.

And the whole time I'm sitting here thinking, shit, she's right. I'm a HUGE fucking burden on her when I should be her partner. I should be someone SHE can lean on, especially now, but instead I'm weak and fragile and worthless.

She's booked as the monster to be overcome, but my question is what happens when that's done? Once the monster has been beaten, they lose their intimidating aura. Since she can't last any decent length of time in the ring (normally content to plod along and stand as still as possible during the opponents offence), can't move with any convincing sense of urgency or intent and is fairly limited at best in terms of her versatility, what does she do after?

The only time I am happy lately is when I am out drinking/talking with girls because I guess I am getting that affection I miss and desire so much but I feel like this is a lot more than just being upset over a break up. I am not sad about the relationship not being there because it was mutual and we both accepted it was not working but I feel insane amounts of loneliness. Not something a 20 year old should not be feeling but I just feel like I am fucking up college and all that now because I honestly feel sad all the time unless I am out doing something proper or interesting so I struggle massively to actually work. I just woke up not long ago after a night out and I instantly tried to get my friends to come out again because I cant get back to sleep and have my insane feeling of sadness the moment I am awake.

I guess I just really crave that attention I once had every day for over three years and now I am crashing massively and feel really shit.

Again, maybe I am totally wrong but I feel like this is more than just me feeling bad over a breakup because I have really similar emotions to back when I was diagnosed with depression (which I have overcome) way back about 5 years ago.

do,"I just read Isochroma's post here

https://m.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/3zqxxb/piracetam_phosphatidylserine/

And I think he might be onto something. He suspects that adrenal insufficiency/fatigue is the cause of Piracetam ""burn out"" (that 6 month honeymoon period some people experience with PIR)/non responders.

Isochroma also says that taking Phosphatidylserine (a cortisol blocker) will help make Piracetam work again via repairing adrenal glands, which he correlates (with lots of studies) to Piracetam non-responders.

Now I have purchased 50% (yes, 50%) of 800mg Phosphatidylserine capsules (which I've been taking every morning for the past week). Which, by itself, definitely works for me by lowering cortisol levels (mine were high and I had so much difficulty waking in the morning) and it is very energising. But how long am I supposed to take Phosphatidylserine before my cortisol levels gets too low?

It has been medically noted that too high or too low cortisol levels will cause adrenal exhaustion. This is what worries me. If I take too much Phosphatidylserine, or not enough, I may end up with either too high (which mine was last year) or too low cortisol levels - respectively - which means that Piracetam will not work for me again as it did so well many years ago.

There is no information on the internet about the Phosphatidylserine/cortisol/Piracetam correlation, so is it something that I should be worried about? Should I just keep taking Phosphatidylserine daily until my Piracetam arrives, or will it lower my cortisol and result in adrenal exhausation/fatigue, stopping Piracetam from working for me again? What kind of indicators should I be looking for?

Thanks"

it makes me mad and sad that i thought i had been okay and moved on but it turns out i didnt
and it makes me sad to think about how sometimes ill have a dream where we run into each other and shes so happy , and so dismissive towards me , making me feel like i never really mattered much in her life anyways. and ill wake up and be mad about how she shows up in my dreams because i know like hell i dont in hers.

and it makes me mad that i ever let her be such a huge part of my life. that when our friendship ended a huge part of me was just removed and i still feel lost from it.

and i feel sad because when i first met her and her family i felt so rejected and unloved by my own. and they showed me so much love and it meant the world to me. 

and i feel so sad because i remember thinking when hanging out with her ""this is why im still alive"" because if i killed myself instead of getting hospitalized i wouldnt have met her and became friends. and even small moments like sitting outside with her and her little brother and her family house in front of a bonfire made me feel like the world was beautiful and worth living.

and i feel sad because she was the only person who made me feel like i actually mattered and was worth something. 

and i feel sad cuz i have all these feelings and its taking me much longer for me to get thru it than i thought lol"

When I found a girl who's into me and I'm into her, we share compliments and normally I hear that I'm good looking, funny, caring... But apparently this is not enough, I keep being rejected, over and over again.

I'm feeling lonely and hopeless. I'm sorry for the long post, but I really needed to vent."

My name is Eric. I'm interested in finding some friendly people to play some games with.

I recently suffered medical complications due to my PTSD and have hours and hours alone at home. I love games and am looking for some people to share in the love!

I live in Western Canada, Mountain time zone. I play a lot of Steam, Blizzard games and a few titles on Xbone. 

Send me a message here, and we can share information and get together in something. I use Skype and Discord.

Have a great day!"
do,"Me and my boyfriend have been dating since October. He's been amazing, he took me out, showed me off, the sex is amazing and we have so much in common, like our affinity for writing and dark humor. Before me, he had never been in an official monogamous relationship. But he said he fell in love with me, and was willing to try.

Did not work, evidentially.

So we've been arguing over an open relationship. I said I didn't think I could do it. He then introduced me to a girl (I am bisexual) and she was pretty much my perfect type and incredibly sweet. He says he wants us both to be in an open relationship and that he wanted me to try it, and promised that he loved me and only me, he just thinks it would strengthen our romantic relationship if we had multiple partners for sexual purposes.

Exhausted, and because I knew he was unhappy, because he hasn't been paying me much attention lately, and the fact he took the time to set me up with someone rather than leave me on my own, I agreed. He was overjoyed. He kissed me passionately after I announced it. He's texted me and it's all been cute. I've had partners this week, and sexually I am fulfilled.

But emotionally I feel empty. I love this guy, or at least I think I do - and on our last date he did nothing but all the homework he procrastinated on (we made plans at 4pm, he was supposed to do his homework before then) and then played video games for most of the date. No sex. No intimate conversations. The girl he set me up with has been more emotionally considerate of me than he has, always asking me my feelings if I am comfortable with everything. I had to help him finish a 600 word essay for Christ sake.

He's supposed to make it up to me tomorrow, to show he really cares about me. This is all so new to me and so fast. I want to make this work, I like the fact we are both having sex with other people I think. But I really want to feel important and loved too. Has anyone else been through this?"
do,"The Dolphins traded Davis to the Colts for two 2013 draft picks. After ditching Brandon Marshall it seems to me like Miami has destroyed any real advantage over New England. A WR like Marshall could have excelled against our potentially still weak secondary and now they trade one of their best defenses against our formidable pass attack. I don't see the major advantage for them in either case. Draft picks are great, but currently they have diddly on us.

do,"I dont know where to start. This will go pretty big. Will try to keep as short as possible.

Okay, I am 16 and in first year high school. For years I had no friends. Last year, I went to psychologist and got treatment. Now I feel better and have some ""friends"". Before, I would be a loner and eat lunch alone. Teachers wont like me when im with my mobile pretending I was just fine.

Now, Since I had a beginning with new people and found some guys. I was diagnosed with level 1 mild asperger syndrome (No one knows except my parents and some teachers and nurses) and have social anxiety. Slowly, my friends started to find my weakness and had began to verbally abuse me. They start telling some really bad s\*\*\* to me and block me on social media and all stuff. I was wrong to trust them and reveal that ""I never had any friends,"" and they start using that whenever I have the upper hand.

They are taking advantage of me and I cannot do anything. I talked with the counselor and the psychologist really softly. I cant tell to the teachers since they think we are good friends with one another. My parents cannot really do anything about me. I give respect and yet get none. They literally take all my jokes and humor offensive even if I take theirs freely.

I just have no idea how to have friends and how to talk. I have to return as a loner and be depressed forever. I have great ambitions but really suck with social life. The worst part is I cannot ignore them since I'll meet them everyday at school in the hallway. I dont have any friends outside school and I think it will be the same there. I dont know what to do."
do,"These have been modified from non slow-cooker recipes. 

1. Preserved lemon chicken stew with onions 

In large slow-cooker: 

a. Pour a layer of olive oil that covers the bottom of the slow cooker 
b. Slice 3-4 white or yellow onions in large circles, layer on the oil 
c. Place chicken pieces (large, skin-on, bone-in if possible) on top of the onions. It's best if these have been marinating in lemon juice and olive oil, but not necessary. 
d. Throw in: powdered ginger (1 tsp), salt (1-2 tsp), garlic powder (1 tsp), turmeric (1 tsp), and black pepper (1-2 tsp). If you have fresh garlic and ginger, it's good to throw some in grated or chopped. If you have real saffron, a pinch is fantastic to add at this point, but it's not worth buying for this dish alone. 
e. If you have access to preserved lemons or have some you make around, rinse well, cut the rind of one lemon in strips, scoop out the pulp from 1/2 lemon, and add to stew. Preserved lemons throw in a bright sour note that is fantastic.  If not, add the zest and juice of 1 medium lemon 
f. If you have fresh parsley or cilantro, you can add them in the beginning as a bundle that you take out for serving or you can also chop finely and add 15 minutes at the end of cooking. 
f. Cover with water or chicken or veggie stock. Cook on low for 6-8 hours.  

Typically, this is a pressure cooker dish (the opposite from slow cooking!). Doing it in the slow cooker is certainly a bit different: the chicken tends to be more tender, and the onions form more of a sauce. If you want to use a pressure cooker, sautee 1/2 of the onions, garlic, spices, and chicken in olive oil until onions caramelize and chicken is browned. Throw in broth and the other 1/2 of the onions, and cook at pressure for 15-20 minutes or until onions are cooked and chicken is tender. 

As with many slow-cooked recipes, it's best to brown everything on a skillet first, but not necessary. It helps caramalize the onions and brown the chicken. 

Serve with bread to sop up the sauce, or if you want to be less traditional and more refined, rice or potatoes. You can also throw in some quartered peeled potatoes 1.5 hrs before serving if desired. 

Ingredients: 
- Chicken (any parts, preferably bone-in, skin-on) 

- 3+ white or yellow onions 

- Preserved lemons or 1-2 medium lemons

- Olive oil 

- Fresh garlic, ginger, cilantro, and parsley (optional) 

- Chicken or vegetable stock (optional) 

Powdered Spices: Salt, pepper, garlic, ginger, turmeric, saffron (optional)"
do,"Hey guys and gals! So I usually get a full panel once every year around this time, and they're usually clean and I don't worry much. I also get an HIV test done every 3 months for safe measure, (I'm a gay male.) 

So I've been dating this guy for about 3 weeks now, and everything is great and fantastic until this morning when I got my results back which stated I have a 13.3 on the IgG index for HSV-1, (which is a pretty mountable defense, honestly.)

How do I tell him that I have asymptomatic herpes? I haven't been with a guy before him for maybe a month or so before that, and I should have had my first OB by now, right?

Another question is since I haven't had an OB before, I don't know if it's oral or genital. Which I think really complicates things. Anyone else ever encounter this issue?"
do,"Hello, fellow fuckers.  I have a question.  My partner (m, 26) and I (f, 25) have recently begun to experiment with me in a more dominat role.  While I have no qualms with this dynamic, I've never really done it before, and kind of feel like I'm shooting in the dark.  In previous relationships as well as this one, I have preferred the more submissive role and I am typically most turned on when my partner is in charge.  He has expressed enthusiastic interest in being the sub and giving me full control.  We've done this a little bit over the past few days, but it still doesn't feel totally natural, and he's had kind of had to direct my taking control.  I'd really appreciate any advice or suggestions from people who are into this and/or have done this.  I am excited to try something new, and thrilled that my guy is so turned on by this dynamic, but I'm just not sure what to do.  Thoughts?"
do,"I remember growing up I was a happy confident kid no one could get me down. I had a few friends and socializing wasn't that hard for me.

Then some things changed out of nowhere around age 11 when my ''best friend'' said I was the ugliest kid in class I think this really ruined my confidence I never really thought of myself as bad looking back then because I come from a good looking family so I thought I wasn't bad looking either but I guess I was wrong. 

Going too high school it didn't get any better many girls said I was scary looking one girl said I looked like a scary clown and they wouldn't want too sit next too me because I scared them.

I dropped out of high school and got into a big depression I would isolate myself from the world and play video games all day too find an escape. 

My parents contacted (not sure if this is correct in english) youth care and I had conversations with people why I wouldn't go too school anymore they tried getting me back into school and I tried some new schools but always dropped out really fast finally I was diagnosed with autism. 

So right now I really don't want too live anymore but I can't end it because I know I would really hurt my parents so I am sitting here rotting away. I tried too get help for my autism already but it doensn't really seem too work I have no motivation left for therapy right now anyway some days I will feel a bit better and go outside but I will get another bad experience for example I was cycling a few weeks ago and then a girl said hey look there's an alien behind us and looked at me or whenever I go shopping I scare people I think it also has something too do with my height (I am 6'8'' tall) and because these bad experiences made me really insecure I am akward too. Another example is I went out too the store the other day and some girls walked in and as soon as they saw me they litterly panicked and quickly walked away from me. I do have really bad anxiety because of these bad experiences now but I am 100% sure I am not being delusional I know they where freaked the fuck out because of me they taught I didn't notice it quickly walked past me. 
This happens alot people stare at me or say something behind my back and think I don't pick up on it but I do and it makes me feel like shit.

I wish I was a normal guy like anyone and could make some friends but right now I don't have any friends and I can't make any new friends right now because I stay inside my house all day hoping I don't get another bad experience. 

I honestly wish I could leave this world and be reborn normal or something but as I said I would never do anything too myself because it would really hurt my parents and I am still hoping that one day something will change (I really hope one day I will be happy again and be confident like I was when I was a kid).

If you read all this sorry for the horrible formatting.

Edit : Would appreciate it alot if you could share your thoughts or have any advice for me."
do,"I've been so anxious, self-doubting, and so critical of myself for the past two years. Before that, I often felt ""on it,"" was quick to make jokes and make friends. Girls were interested in me, hell most people were interested in me. I've been doing a study abroad thing for the past month and it seems like such a chore to get people to talk to me, and I'm more inclined to just be silent rather than try to drag out anything interesting to say. Aside from talking to one person who isn't in my class, who I've felt comfortable around, I feel unhappy alone, and unhappy with the group. 

In class (in Russian) we were talking about what we're ""experts"" in and I couldn't think of a single thing, just said music. I realized that my only hobbies are occasionally watching old Soviet movies, going for runs (I don't like it, it's just for health), pounding a few beers in my room and listening to instrumental hip-hop, and smoking cigarettes on my balcony. I used to bake bread and kiss girls. I was out with an acquaintance and she asked me what my idea of happiness was, and I didn't have an answer, although the first thing that came to my mind was having sex, loving someone, and cuddling. From 2009-2013 (college and post-college years), I always had people to see, had a girlfriend, all that stuff. Now, where I'm doing my grad school program, and have been for nearly 10 months, I have 2 decent friends and have not been on a single date. Last year I was diagnosed ADHD and given pills, but now I just realize the stimulants make me more anxious. I take a weak anxiety drug to sleep but I'm still, on the whole, extremely stressed, irritable, and nervous. I'm going to finish my master's degree next year, I'll be able to find a good job, I'm sure. I've become super career-driven and motivated to network successfully. But now I can't remember the authors of books I've read long ago, what the meaning of Crime and Punishment was about, the plots to all the Woody Allen films I watched years ago, I just feel like I have NOTHING to say to anyone, except to complain about the weather and joke about how hard it is to learn Russian.

do,"So I'm a male college student working at a fast-food restaurant for the summer. Think of it kind of like Chipotle where you are in charge of preparing a meal while the customer watches and gives instructions. We're encouraged to chat with the customers and it turns out I'm pretty good at it. Most of the clientele is young women (part of the reason I took this job) and I'm able to have interesting conversations and joke around with them pretty easily. I know there were some opportunities where I could have gotten a number, there were some occasions where we were chatting and she was smiling/flirting and then after I ring them up I'll just say ""have a good one"" and they'll kind of be taken aback and be like ""oh, ok"" as if I just rejected them.

do,"Since I can remember I've always been hard on myself and never really thought I will be good enough for anything. 

I never really did  well at school and my family life was very chaotic due to alcohol. After my nursing degree which to this day I still don't know how I got, I went to my GP and I started in anti depressants. For a while everything was pretty good and I was doing well as a newly qualified nurse. 

One day I stupidly decided to stop taking my medication and I went into complete meltdown. this got worse when I met my ex girlfriend who was with her new boyfriend. Seeing her happy really made me feel like she was better off without me. 

Ever since then I've been struggling at work. I feel like I'm shit at my job or any job for that matter. It's got to the point where i instantly think I can't do anything and I'm a useless person. I've never really been a happy person but I put on a front and show my friends that I'm this happy free person which is far from the truth. 

I have been seeing a therapist but I don't really apply myself to the programme because I feel like it won't change me. Anything I start I do not finish as I think it will be too much work and ill have to commit myself to it all day or there is something better to do. 

I do have a social life. I am captain of my rugby team and my family situation has been more stable. 

My depression has got to the point where I can't concentrate anymore or focus on anything good.  Instead I worry constantly about everything. So much so that I had to take sick leave from my work as they were getting worried about me and I've been off my work now for a month. I went to my doctor and he is very nice and understanding. I was diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety. Now it's weird to come to terms with it because it's not physical and I don't know how it actually impacts on things in my life. Like if I went to the gym I sometimes become very anxious for no reason and just want to give up because I feel like I'm not getting anywhere.  

My doctor back in 2012 just said to me that I'm showing symptoms of depression and never really diagnosed me. 

I'm just stuck with what to do with my life. I'm 24 now and don't know how to pursue things in my life or if I'll ever be happy. And why me?"

I need my job to pay bills and insurance purposes, and I don't want to say I NEED friends, but I do miss feeling like I'm a part of the general 'socialsphere'. It feels like MS has turned me into a hermit, the complete opposite of how I used to be even a year ago. Before my diagnosis, I was a social butterfly. Now I feel like I've kind of been ostracized by everyone I know because they 'know I'll cancel plans' and I've even started withdrawing away from my closest people for that reason.

It began this winter (November). I live in Northern Canada and have actually not spent much time outside.

I noticed it just randomly happened once while walking Pre-snow and now it happens every time. But only if my whole body is cold. If just my hands are cold they’re fine.

do,"So at my school, we are offered a class to take research for credit - you pretty much just do research as you were, and your PI gives you a 3 credit A.

I've got this down for three semesters already, so 9 credits of 'free' A's, AND it qualifies as part of my sGPA because it's assigned ""BMS4905"" which stands for biomedical sciences.

This thing is keeping my GPA alive after mental illness and three semesters of academic shittiness have brought me to a mid-high 3.4. I have good EC's, no MCAT yet, and ORM.

Firstly, will this get me booted out immediately? Will they 'see through it?' How is this perceived? What are the common beliefs regarding research credit?

Secondly, can I keep taking this? I'm working hard at school (as much as I can - for example I got an 18/20 on exam 1 in physics 2, and then crushing defeat of a 10-13/20 on exam 2 last night. Has eroded my confidence instantaneously as the fears of underperformance, failure, and directionlessness return), but I'm ngl having A's from research will help.

So can I take research credit 4 times? 5 times? 10?

How does the limit work, how are they viewed, etc???

I had a 15 day streak going but then I fucked it up. I have been edging for 3 days now. Let’s get this confession done and back on track. But wanted to share some reasons and see if people have same issues.

My relapse was a strange combination of depression, stress, normal urge for sex and hangover. 

I basically started to edge when I woke up feeling hangover. The first day it took only like 5 minutes and I stopped. Then the next day I was hungover again and feeling depressed. I felt kind of numb and I just started to think about the whole nofap thing as something futile. I just got this feeling that I don’t care anymore and that there is nothing more to it. So I edged like an hour with porn and then continued to fall into my old habits on Monday as well. I had and still have a very stressful period at work but I made a decision now to get back on track with nofap. Sorry all and support me in my mission. Don’t let go friends!

This has been going on for the past few weeks and I’m having a hard time going even a day without it. Last night, I smoked four bowls from my bong and I told myself that I was becoming extremely sick of doing this shit everyday and my highs weren’t the same as before. So I decided to take a week or two off just to get my life back on track. I ended up with a C in English and I blame it on weed. Same with the ACT, which I scored a 23 on due to my lack of studying. It has significantly worsened my motivation and drive to live. I find myself becoming depressed more often with it and yet I crave it every second that I’m sober. At least I recognize that I have a problem. I don’t want to live the rest of my life running away from my problems with an artificial and temporary high. I don’t wanna become a lazy stoner who won’t amount to anything. I was ambitious before this addiction. I know this will be difficult but I also know that it’ll be worth it.

do,"Wall of text. Feel free to skip. I should say my psychiatrist did his fellowship at Johns Hopkins, the best medical school, and the ECT head went to Stanford and is certified in ect and connected to the (well-respected medical) university here (Tampa)

I have been diagnosed variously schizophrenia /schizoaffective /and even bipolar. I was in a psych ward and left for dead pretty much at 18, recovered completely after detox from a crazy psych cocktail, got B. A, M. A. even taught abroad. Had a very stressful illness in a minor city in China and whatever medicine given either caused or exacerbated some delusional thinking. But I recovered in a major Chinese city on what I assume was sedatives. When I got back to the US I couldn't sleep and eventually went on the antipsychotic paliperidone and klonopin after trying various medicines including trazodone and got a job teaching English as a second language at a university , but decided to go off the antipsychotic , which went poorly as heavy depression set in again sparked by illness followed by psychosis and hospitalization twice, both psychosis remitting after a few days. Stayed on the paliperidone. 

Flash forward to this fall. Eventually decided I'd had enough of the inhuman feeling of paliperidone, I became ridiculously depressed and was having issues with my body freezing in place and moving in genral. One medicine (memantine) I took made me suicidal to the extent that i was arrested and involuntarily held in a hospital that my neurologist had suggested I get ect in if Ativan didn't work. (he also diagnosed multifocal dystonia and catatonia, which the catatonia the psychiatrists didn't seem to agree with) 

I was lucky because psychotic depression set in mildly after a few days in the psych ward but no one noticed and the next day I had ect. Been through four sessions since. After the first, the suicidality and inability to move much and psychotic depression went away, and, eventually, after a few weeks, I began to feel a sense of happiness for the first time in at least ten years  

I've tried and has bad reactions to pretty much every atypical antipsychotic on the market, and been shot with Haldol at least 4 times. Also tried pristiq and wellbutrin with suicidal thoughts as side effects for the first one and clonus for the second, which I thought may have to do with serotonin syndrome

Currently taking klonopin 1mg 2x a day only. Psychiatrist thinks some people are not fit for antipsychotics as I always get all the side effects (Same with antidepressants)

do,"To the guy in Downtown Houston who saved my life tonight, I can't thank you enough. 

Background: I was on the Tinder date from hell. Total catfish. What was supposed to be a coffee date followed by an art class turned into him lying about everything and it actually being an art class where he was posing nude. What's worse is I saw him try to spike my drink, and he was just overall really making me uncomfortable. I couldn't really find a way out of the situation because he had an explosive anger (his car got towed and he was screaming at innocent strangers about it) and I was scared. 

I saw you crossing the street so I ran up to you, called you Jacob and gave you a hug and quickly and quietly whispered for you to play along. I was frazzled and freaked out so I couldn't really keep up with the ruse, but you did. Asshole left, and you took your time to make sure I was ok before I left. 

I know I probably made your night weird, and I'm sorry about that. You were a perfect gentleman and truly my lifesaver. You mentioned your name but I was still so shaken up the entire thing was a blur. I know it's a long shot that you'll see this, but thank you so much!

do,"I want to keep this as anonymous as possible, so I'll be using fake names here. Our subjects are Carol and Judy.

Carol (executor of trust) and Judy recently inherited a large estate. Judy suggested they use a friend of hers as their lawyer. (I feel like it's important to note: Judy has been involved in a long-standing sexual affair with this lawyer. He's married, but this tryst of theirs has been going on for at least 15 years.) 

Anyway, long story short:

- The lawyer never stated how much he would be charging for his services. When Carol asked, he said, ""don't worry about it."" 
She didn't know how much he charged until she received a bill.

- He kept things overly casual, often treating Judy like she was the executor and not divulging pertinent information to Carol until much later.

- Judy ended up with $200 thousand more than Carol, even though the inheritance was to be split 50/50.

- The lawyer (verbally) told Carol any expenses she had to pay out-of-pocket would be reimbursed via the inheritance, but then he backtracked (in written format) and told her she would NOT receive any reimbursement.

What, if anything, can be done in this situation? Would it be worth the trouble to sue the attorney for unfair representation? Or is Carol out of luck?"
do,"Right, so I've recently started up a D&amp;D 5E game with a few IRL friends, it's my first time GMing fantasy in awhile, not to mention my first time GMing face-to-face in a few years as the lion's share I've done for awhile now has been via Roll20. So, I'm having a whale of a time writing up my own universe but I've hit a little bit of a roadblock on this one idea I'm really keen to run with but can't quite finish up one part of it. Basically in ye olde times big bad evil guy was too powerful to simply kill, and so was sealed, his spirit banished to the negative energy plane and his body cast into a pocket dimension, which is locked with three seals. The giantess/titan who did said sealing, spent of every last drop of her power after the banishment, gave all she could think of to apply said seals, she sacrificed a part of herself to do it (a hand, forearm, arm, it's negotiable at this point). 

So, thus far I've got two of the seals worked out, one was her knucklebones, which were entrusted to a group of druids, to be planted, and over the years they have grown into a magnificent golden tree.

The second was a vial of her spilled blood, to be consumed by a mortal who had offered her aid in her slaying of big bad evil bastard, granting him the charisma and force of will needed to lead, and so long as his line continued, so would the seal remain in place. (Got it in my head that this was the beginning of a current day royal line).

Problem is the third seal, I've been back and forth on ideas but nothing's coming up that I like as much as the first two. So, instead of continuing to bang my head against a creative wall I thought I'd crowd source some ideas, if anyone would be willing to help out on what would make a cool third seal, that could conceivably come from the sacrifice of a hand/arm."
do,"Just have to get this out there. 

I've been receiving texts from my family about his heart surgeries and the complications that have arisen with his heart and lungs. Today I receive a text saying that they have put him on emergency life support. I then receive a text about 1 hour ago saying that the Dr's are saying that there is nothing more they can do and that he has been taken off of life support.

I stopped. How, why, what...? So many questions swirling around in my head. I just want him to be remembered. I don't care if he was only 3 and has been in and out of the hospital so many times that I can't count the trips on one hand. I don't care that he didn't have the chance to go to school or to play on a playground. I don't care that he didn't get to experience life the way all of us have.

He was such a great person. I don't care that he was only 3. I want him back, but that is not going to happen. I want to see his smiling face at Thanksgiving and any other family event. I will miss him.

I'm also absolutely awkward with family in this situation. I know that I feel broken, but my Uncle and Aunt must fill a million times worse. I didn't go visit him in the hospital this time around because I was too scared. I have cried almost every night for him... it's all so hard to comprehend.

At my job I prepare food for customers in front of them and have to wear a hat at all times. It can be any kind of hat that isn't crude or political. My grandfather served in WWII and was also a policeman in the 60's in New Jersey. He was a very respected man and my family misses him terribly. Unfortunately, he died in 2003 from a genetic disease. I recently found the WWII hat many veterans wear and was wondering if it would be disrespectful if I wore it at work. 

Being a young female it's very obvious that I didn't serve. But I thought it would be a neat way to have my grandad with me and a conversation piece for our customers. My family can't decide if it's disrespectful or not, so I'm turning to the community to help me figure it out. 

The last thing I want to do is to disrespect anyone. I'm posting through mobile, so if it looks weird or if I'm missing anything I apologise. 

Thank you!


Edit: Thank you all for the replies. I have decided I won't be wearing the hat. I believe hanging it up with his picture in my room is the best way to celebrate him."

A) Artificially treat native soil so that it can grow earth crops, or

This was in Oregon . Now as I understand it the house has to go into probate regardless of marriage correct?

He smokes about a pack a day of camel crush. That's typical ..increases if/when he smokes or is around friends . 

In September he got a wicked chest cold and decreased his amount smoke by alot. Also told me he had stopped but apparently began hiding his smoking from me until I caught him one day. Now over the last two weeks .. even though he says it's decreased it is/had become  about a pack a day again . 

He had a chronic dry cough . Coughs while he is smoking. Coughs when he wakes up. Etc etc . 

When I have shared concerns about it , I have just been told that "" he can't stop""  and is apparent that he won't. I have mentioned vaping as I used to be an avid vaper for the last 2 years. I have all the equipment he needs for a great setup to transition. 

Now.. I know that any person with an addiction you can't just will them to quit. I have tried to be supportive .. I have recommended different things.. it's just not helping and me talking to him about it just shuts him down to the point of not wanting to talk about it.

I am genuinely concerned about his health. I literally have mild panic attacks when i see him smoking because all I can think about is our daughter and her losing her father too soon.

Are there recommendations for me as a concerned partner on what I should do? Should I just sit by and watch him kill himself ? How do I speak to him without seeming naggy and having him understand my concerns for his health ? He had always poopoo'd me when I have mentioned anything about doctors ..dentists...etc. especially since he had a couple different conditions that need to be checked out regularly... But has not seen a doctor since we began dating .

I hate having these feelings of complete helplessness and that the continuation of smoking is just selfish and being chosen over our child .. I know I know.. I blame pregnancy hormones for the last one .

Over the years he just became unbearable to be friends with but I just toughed it out, he was controlling to the point if I had a friend he took over, if he was bored I would have to hang out with him or have him get our mutual friends to beat me up the next day in school, one night in particular when I was forced to hang out with him we got mugged, I ended up with the worst injuries. I faced about 7-9 months at home recovering because of how bad of a state I was both physically and mentally, I was diagnosed with depression/PTSD alongside my numerous broken fingers but for the most part I kept quiet about it, he used the opportunity to mock me to my face infront of about 30 people we go to school with when I came back to do my exams a few weeks after bandaged up saying I'm a pathetic piece of shit just because he was trying to show off infront of a girl he wanted to fuck, the fact I was in a far worse condition he was yet he used it to be a complete dick really just made me fucking sick of him. 

[This is how bad of a condition I was, this is what I will carry for the rest of my fucking life because of him.](http://i.imgur.com/fLymuW5.jpg)

Over the next few weeks after that he left to mix with a bigger group of assholes, I was alone with my depression when I needed anybody the most, for a while I wanted just nothing more than to kill myself, over time I felt so fucking numb I just felt happy in isolation. I eventually got better over the next year, we came back into contact because he wanted to split the girl he wanted to fuck up with her boyfriend and they turned on him, I gave him the cold shoulder because in all fairness I had better things to do with my time then waste it on a piece of egotistical shit like him.

Eventually he got into a relationship with a THIRTEEN year old girl, we were both 18 years old at the time, what made it worse is not he tried rubbing it in my face, it was all over Facebook and everything, even how much sex they were having, he tried all sorts of stupid shit to try make me jealous of him like he's 'got one over' on me, in fairness I just didn't care whatever the fuck he was doing I just ignored him..Not only that a year on when I was seeing a girl (She was 17 years old) he tried stealing her, that's the last time I ever bothered with him, I gave him chances and he proved he's not worth my time. 

It's about 5 years on from when we were mugged, I still haven't got over my depression, but the fact people just fucking seem to like him for being a prick and I can't even get anybody to talk to me just fucking kills me, he ruined a bunch of my friendships, he ruined most of my late teenage life, every day I'm reminded of what happened and have to carry these broken fingers for the rest of my fucking life.

For his dealings in Jamacia before he emigrated to the United States. Our professor told us about his back to Africa movement claimed to be sponsored by racist politicians.


So my question is it as simple as I am imagining things where he is simply a shyster who moved from jamacia where he was figured out then moved to america where his snake oil salesmanship continued or is it more nuanced to see him as an advocate for the rights of African Americans where such a thing was rare?"

do,"I don't know if this is the right place to post and I feel like I'm too young.
I just finished high school and I'm not ready for adulthood at all. It feels like I need another 3 years of school life. I feel like rewinding time and just fix things. What I'm about to write is going to be jumbled up because I'm stressed out but I doubt anyone is going to read.

A while ago, I was diagnosed with Adult ADHD. Doing usual things, especially studying, is something that I find pretty impossible. I had a hard time at school and failed many tests. I even had to cheat my way out of some of those tests to avoid the harsher consequences of failing because the schools are pretty tight here. I feel like there's a certain limit on how much I can study before my head literally hurts, and it's happened multiple times now. My parents hired a tutor to help my studies and they thought it would make my grades sky high although in reality the tutor was to make my grades at least just good enough to pass. Though I would have one of those moments where I suddenly able to study and do something, it's pretty rare. So studying academic subjects in college is pretty much going to make me fail.
The problem is that I also have issues with studying outside of academic subjects. Such as just learning how society works, game rules, how to do this and that, etc. As a child I love to draw and make stuff and thus I want to go to private school where studying art is more advanced than the public school version. The thing is that I can't improve on my art skills and just like my academic studies, I feel like I've reached my limit, and it's not enough. I've seen and met a lot of kids way younger than me who could program, draw, animate, make music, and all that and they make some amazing things. I can't, because I just can't learn, no matter how much I take courses and try. I don't know how to start like those people do and improve from there. I'm very inferior to many people younger than me who I shouldn't be and I don't know what to do from here. It feels like if I was to catch up to those people, it would take me years to accomplish the slightest of what they can do. I don't know how to drive, cook and do other usual things I'm expected to at this age. I literally have no redeeming features and feel sad because many younger people are better than me in every way. 

I still haven't been accepted to any colleges. I'm not sure how it works in other countries but in my country there are 2 types of colleges, public school, which is regarded as the best ones because they study engineering, biology, and high-level science, and then there's private school which is easier to get to. To get into public school is harder. Most students study for at least 2 YEARS to prepare and I have no preparation. It's a very heavy competitive exam to apply there. I feel so fucking dumb because I should've known that I could actually sign up and be accepted into private school A YEAR BEFORE and have no problems now. But I messed up and now I have to take the private school test in the last wave and they accept less students now. Even my friend whose rank is the lowest in my school already have been accepted in private school learning IT with a 50% scholarship. Everyone who's trying to apply for public school is stressed as fuck and here I am not even sure that I'll get accepted in private school. Those who applied for public school also applied to private school for backup if they aren't accepted so you know they're easier.

Here's the real problem. My father wants me to go to public school. Since both my older brothers did not go to public school, my father demands that I go to public school so at least one of his sons can follow in his steps (and also brag about it). He says that I should just take the test even though I have absolutely no preparation and the chances of me getting accepted is pretty much zero. It's a waste of time since I have no chances anyway. I do want to go to public school and be an engineer or a teacher with an art talent as a side thing, but it's impossible. I don't know where or if I can get work if I manege to finish art school and if I'll be able to make a living. If I were to take private school he said that I should just take one overseas, but I declined because I don't have much experiences on living alone. My parents didn't really remind me of college, driving, making an ID, during my school years and I'm way behind now and so naive about many things. The thing is I could've studied art as a side thing because that's a hobby thing while I'm in public school but I can't do neither.

Everyone is disappointed at me for not trying to apply to public school and I myself is worried and depressed and I'm not sure if I get accepted to private school. The private school appliance test is tomorrow and I'm so stressed and scared. If I don't get accepted my parents will disown me because everyone is expected to be accepted there and everyone is expected to get into college and I messed up. I'll lose all my friends as well...

I'm not even going to mention on how I'm socially wrecked and have other illnesses. I'm hyperactive and have suicidal thoughts, depression, and very disturbing thoughts. I don't have many friends, I've lost many of them. Many people don't like me because I'm just awkward and most of the times, stupid, I'm not that useful when talking or working with other people, everything I do backfires. Long story short, other aspects of life is also pretty bad.

I don't know what to do now, I've reached my limit. I just hate life right now and I just feel like disappearing. My future is still dark and I just hate everyone right now. My brothers for not going to public school and thus I have to be the one pressured into doing so. My parents for not supplying me with enough preparation for the future. I just wished that I disappear. It feels like I'm mistake and I wished my parents would just stuck to 2 kids. I feel many people would be better off without me because I'm a nuisance and not pretty much meaningful and sometimes ruin something. My parents would be better off without a failure. (I know it might seem melodramatic to suddenly have suicidal thoughts after talking about academic stuff but I do have severe mental illnesses and this post is focused on the academic stuff)

I feel as if I've messed up literally everything in my life up to this point and there's not too much hope for the future as well. There isn't a moment in my past in which wouldn't go back to and change. I feel like I've got no chance of living out my dreams anymore. I literally can't do anything and I just want to disappear.
I'm not ready at all and I hate myself for being so stupid and naive. I just want it to stop.."
do,"Hello. I am 22 and just learned yesterday that my father has ODed twice in the last 6 months on heroin. He was sent to a rehab facility on Monday after his latest OF (he died and was brought back by narcan, very thankful for that) and this is the first I've known about his addiction. Apparently, he has been using pills, cocaine, and cannibas throughout my life and I feel like I don't know him. My parents divorced when I was very young and I am the closest person to him, I visited every weekend and tried to be his support system as a kid. He is a nasty human being who has no friends, no family, and his professional life is in shambles. He is being disbarred (he was a failing lawyer) and literally has nothing to live for. His mother who lives with him, my grandmother just got her hip replaced and found out about all this in her recovery facility. I just feel so lost, like my entire life has been some fabricated lie. I'm angry, and upset at myself for not seeing the signs (I work at a mental health/substance abuse advocacy group) and I'm  just so heart broken. Any advice on how to work through these next steps?

do,"35M 5ft 9in, 148 lb, been on meds for ~ 1.5 months for anxiety and depression. 

I went to psychiatrist feeling majorly sad, no will to work on myself, seeing my life in impending doom. Diagnosed with depression + Anxiety. I was prescribed Prozac (20mg) and Wellbutrin (300 mg) about 1.5 months ago. I initially saw very good effect, more energy, positiveness, just feeling better. Lets say my initial state of mind was =  0 (when I went to doc first time)

State of mind on starting meds: 

Day 1 = 0       (tired, hopeless, depressed, sad, cant concentrate, feeling sleepy at work after good rest, at times cried)

Day 3-16 = 80 (very cheerful, working, waking early, attentive at work, feeling some hope in myself etc)

Day 18-45 = 20 (yes I suddenly came down have some energy, few hours in day of feeling better and others which are same as before. I have not gone to 0 but I am just hovering above)


I informed doctor right in this manner that my initial med euphoria is gone [after 30 days]. I may have told him I had decent attention to work for first 15 days and now I start feeling sleepy, tired middle of day and dont work as much. He talked a bit and gave me Adderral (saying I have ADHD ?). 


Now Adderal doesn't work for me, gives me headaches and feeling nauseated. I took for 7 days and stopped. Now he has increased my dosage of Prozac to 40 mg. I feel little better (about ~35 on my scale). But I also have some thoughts of suicide. I dont plan on anything immediate so don't be alarmed. My doctor is on holiday, so I need advice. I am worried if I reduce my dosage I will go back feeling too shitty. I also know that I may have to discontinue meds after 3 months (insurance discontinuing issues) so I need to have a way of reducing meds slowly. My post is getting too long, so I update if you have any questions. 


AN UPDATE FROM JOURNAL (if anyone in need comes to this post): Its been only 3 days but I notice I am feeling DROWSY almost whole day. Can't get out easily off bed (I used to do that very easily earlier, even with severe depression. I would just get up make coffee and play video games but I had energy for that). I can get 12 hours sleep I still fight falling ASLEEP AT WORK. And continuous YAWNING.

But I also have a strange desire/ responsibility feel to do something. Its so weird. Like I did all my exercise today, I didn't cheat on how many sets. I wanted to do 3 sets as my Physical therapist had suggested. I felt I NEED to take out trash, otherwise it sits there one more week. NOPE DONE AS I AM YAWNING AND SLEEPY. I cooked last night, with music ON on the side putting in good effort. Yes I dont do my work and I am still carefree about losing my job soon! That  ""I dont give a sh!t"" about big things in life is still there, I dont know how to that doesn't worry me at all. I may post this elsewhere, but someday someone will have similar symptoms I want to update for their sake."

do,"I've had back pain on and off since I was 11. It started off as being posture related, I was also very rigid and tense all day at school. I'm 17 now and it's gotton really serious this past year + and I'm currently in the depths of the most debilitating pain I've ever experienced. It started in my upper back, shoulders, neck, all those muscles and nerves. Now, it's in my lower back aswell, which is really worrying me. The pain is coming from the base of my spine, my tail bone. I didn't sleep a wink last night, on a good night I'm getting 3-4 hours. I can't sleep with the pain everywhere, lying down makes it worse and I need a new mattress. I can't do anything, I can't even concentrate on anything it's so all pervasive. I'm on strong anti-inflamotrys and pain gel. Think it helps take the edge off the upper back pain, but the lower back just feels deeper, almost in my bones or something and nothing helps. Anyways sorry for whining on about it, I know no one cares! But I wish I could pinpoint a cause. Could be related to AS? Poor posture, being 'stiff' and 'rigid'.. I've always felt rather uncomfortable in my body, clumsy too. I feel awkward in all my movements, even walking. I feel unnatural, odd, I can't explain. I've had bad social anxiety since puberty, so that means alot of muscle tension over the years. Could I have dyspraxia? Or could it be in some way related to the AS?

do,"For the past 3 years of my life the walls of my home have been my prison. I can count on my fingers the number of times I have left the house. I need help.

 My backstory:

- Age 17 I moved across the country to be with a girl I was in a LDR with for 3 years after saving money working a full time job. The day after I arrived I found out she had been cheating with two different guys and I kicked her out back to her parents. I stayed in this apartment for 6 months completely alone as I paid upfront in cash due to being under 18. 

- Age 18 I witnessed my grandfather die, then a few months later, 3 days before my 19th birthday, I witnessed my mother die.

- Age 19 I moved to another country as an au pair where I stayed for a few months before moving back due to feeling so isolated, I then got into a relationship with a girl. Turns out she was secretly escorting and when I confronted her about it she had a psychotic break, psychically attacked me then she tried to commit suicide. Our break up involved me, her and an armed police unit with guns drawn.

- Age 21 I met another girl and everything was pretty good until she fell pregnant 18 months later. We agreed to keep the baby and tell our families, who were happy. However, she had an abortion at 11 weeks after telling me she wasn't ready and had it done the day after telling me. I was heart broken and whilst I didn't hold it against her, we broke up 6 weeks later on new years mutually. I left my job as I worked with her family and it was all too weird for me.

Since then I have been diagnosed as having Clinical depression, General and Social anxiety, and Agoraphobia. I have been on Citalopram, Venlafaxine, Mirtazipine, and Proprananol however the side effects were too intense for me. I have had CBT which didn't help and I have been referred for assessment for Aspergers which I am awaiting.

My family has split up since my mother died. My brother is at university and my father now lives with his girlfriend on the other side of the country from me and I have no friends.

I'm asking for advice from others who have weathered such a storm as this and made it through the other side. What can I do to get out of this and have a meaningful existence?"

I currently use a 24"" 144hz 1080p monitor and I'm looking to keep the 144hz aspect but the resolution question has me feeling indecisive. My PC has a GTX 1080 with a Ryzen 5 1600. I currently play mostly Overwatch and World of Warcraft. In OW I steadily get 150+ fps with pretty much max settings. In WoW it ranges from 70 fps in high density areas to 150+ in less demanding places.

I'm not entirely sure if my PC could handle the 1440p as well as it can 1080p.

These are some of the 1080p options I've been looking at: ViewSonic XG2701 - Asus VG278Q

I also noticed a sale on newegg for the Acer XG270HU which seems like a good deal for a 1440p option.

It seems like the choice is stick to 1080p for better performance or up to 1440p for smoother image while sacrificing performance a bit?

We would live together with no Visa restrictions
A new job
New start

Of course I know all these things cant bring true inner peace. Well my feelings of spiritual crisis have become worse again as things have settled and become more routine. The depression has gotten far worse, I am snappy with people, feel no connection more intensely and I cant feel much or any love for my GF anymore. At the core I still feel its a dark night because I did all these things and still dont feel I am on the right path, but could that also be due to feeling so bad? I keep thinking I should quit my job again, end the relationship and go back to the US but I dont think that would solve anything either. A bit stuck but completely aware. I have tried to explain it to my gf as well.

I think there is a lot of fears as well everytime im in a serious relationship that I cant see myself as married of having kids even though I think id like those things if I was feeling good again.

do,"When I was 18 I was diagnosed with prostatitis. For those who do not know, that is an inflaming of the prostate. Mine is non bacterial so it was not cleared up by the normal round of antibiotics. Some of my symptoms include, discomfort in my urethra, frequent urination (especially at night), and the worst part, difficulty with erections. I'm a freshman in college, and hooking up and having sex is all anyone really talks about (kind of an exaggeration but its a huge part of college life). My friends talk about having sex and I always just feel like shit because of my situation. 

Before I was diagnosed, I had a sexual encounter with a girl I had been trying to hook up with since the seventh grade. I had incredible difficulty getting an erection, all though I was eventually able to and we had sex, the experience was traumatizing. Especially because we have numerous mutual friends. Ever since then I have been absolutely terrified of having any sort of sexual encounter with a woman, even though I'm still a 19 year old male with a fully functioning sex drive. As I'm typing this, a girl in one of my classes who has been relentless in trying to get me to ""netflix and chill"" with her, finally broke me down and I said. All I can think about is how I have absolutely no confidence in my ability to get an erection. Right after I said yes I finally broke down and called my doctor and asked for a viagra prescription. But I feel like shit because I'm a fucking 19 year old who is going to need a pill meant for dudes in their fifties to have sex. 

This whole situation has really put a shit stain on my first semester of college. I'm also perpetually worrying that this medical issue will never go away. I have switched to a specialist who I will see over my winter break, but thats not for a month.

do,"Hey 2x! I would love some insight on this.

I am currently in a developing relationship with a wonderful man. We began as platonic friends, then friends with benefits, then roommates with benefits, and now we're very close and consider ourselves partnered. I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/lgm2b/2x_im_utterly_incompetent_when_it_comes_to/) about three months ago regarding my feelings towards him and how I should proceed, and as you can see, things have since gone marvelously.

Here is the kicker. The one area where we don't really see eye to eye at all is in the realm of mental disorders. I was recently (within 6 months) diagnosed with ADD and moderately severe cyclical mood disorder, both I have actively shown symptoms of since I was around 11 or 12. (I also have a long family history of depression and depressive mood disorders). I was put on Vyvanse for the ADD by a general practitioner, but because the mood disorder diagnosis was from a licensed social worker, I was not prescribed medication for it. The counselor that I saw was actually part of a five-session free counseling package I got through my university's student health center. She helped me understand that my depression and mood swings weren't because I was emotionally weak, or through any other fault of mine. In these sessions, I learned about this disorder and how to better combat the symptoms to minimize their effects in my everyday life. These five therapy sessions have helped me tremendously, but dealing with the mood swings and the cyclical thinking during them is still incredibly difficult. 

Before our relationship when we were just friends and roommates, I hid my mood swings from him. I dealt with anxiety alone, by smoking a little weed and forcing myself to do homework by myself in my room, and I handled my depressive cycles in a similar manner. Basically, by mostly isolating myself for a few days until they lessen and are easier to deal with. 

When our friendship began to progress clearly into a real relationship, I was ecstatic, naturally. We are very close friends, and we just complement each other very well. I suppose the new relationship energy staved off my mood swings for the most part, and even when I did have them, I just dealt with them how I always have. But now, things are starting to become different.

The past couple of days, I hit the bottom of a particularly severe depressive stage. Because we share more of an emotional connection now, it is close to impossible for me to hide this kind of thing from him. We just spoke about it, and while he wants to help me, I can tell that he has no idea what to do, and is probably a bit put off by the idea.

He is like me when I have taken my ADD medicine and am not in the middle of a downswing: rational, calm, collected, level-headed, and extremely logical. (We are both in science/tech fields and tend to approach most problems from a logical problem-solving mentality; I am a second year mechanical engineering student and he just got his degree in business IT). He simply cannot comprehend the fact that I become a completely different person when I am in the middle of a depressive cycle, and that if I begin to spiral that way, I am not going to be able to function as logically or rationally as I do when I feel healthy. He is trying his best to wrap his head around it, but I can't shake the feeling that a small part of him is frustrated with me because I can't just come up and control my feelings. I have tried explaining to him what it is like, but I think it is just something that is difficult to grasp unless one has experienced it. 

I am extremely tight financially right now and cannot afford additional therapy, although ideally I would like be able to see someone who can let me try medication. Maybe if my money situation eases up, I will take this avenue. 

In the meantime, ladies (and occasional gentlemen), what else do you think I can do? I know this is difficult for him to understand, and I just want to make decisions and do things that would be best for both of us. I would hate for my condition to be the thing that splits apart an otherwise beautiful and healthy relationship, especially because I know that he doesn't understand it at all."
do,"Hey everyone. I am a current University junior, studying physics. However, I have an interest in language evolution, as well as in minority/endangered/indigenous languages and their survival/documentation.

As stated, I'm interested in  historical linguistics, as well as endangered languages, etc. So, is it possible for me to go from a physics undergraduate degree to something along these lines, and what would I have to do?

Like, I understand that if the store doesn't have my size, I go get something in the men's section or order it online! It's no big deal. Why are all these TITP and HAES people so deluded into thinking that since there's ""more of them"", they rule the world?"
do,"How do you guys control your jealousy when it comes to your partner(s) and their (platonic!) friends?

I always thought I had a solid grip on my jealousy (ha) but then I started dating a guy who basically only has girl friends. Like, almost 70% of his friends are girls. And I'm jealous all. the. time. 

It's so exhausting! I don't want to fight with my boyfriend. I don't want to ask him to hang out with his friends less often. I don't want to feel like trash every time he goes rollerblading with a female friend. 

I feel like I'm handling it the best way I know how. Taking time to think rationally and calmly before getting (too) emotional, using ""I feel"" statements instead of getting angry and putting the blame on him for having friends, etc. And I feel like he's handling it well too and being so understanding. But... I don't want to *have* to do that. I don't want *him* to have to do that! I just want to be genuinely okay with him having a life and not feel jealous about him having friends. Is that even possible with BPD?

The dumbest part of this whole problem: almost ALL of my friends are guys. I am frequently the only girl in a group of guys and I thought I would be so much more understanding than I am. I'm so hypocritical when it comes to this and it is so fricking exhausting. I feel crazy :("
do,"Hi! I posted this before on another depression subreddit, but didn't get any response. I thought I'd try posting it here and see if y'all have any ideas. Sorry if that steps on any toes!

Hey sad subreddit people! A bit about myself: I'm 23, female, unemployed, and chronically depressed. I was diagnosed at fifteen, but it certainly started before then, most likely when I was three or so. I've tried a few types of therapy - CBT, DBT, psychodynamic, generic talky-talk - with no success. I also haven't seen any results from medication. Off the top of my head, I know I've tried various dosages and combinations of Prozac, Zoloft, Pristiq, Cymbalta, Effexor, Desipramine, Wellbutrin, Klonopin, Abilify, Trazadone, Strattera, Lithium, Lamictal, Adderall, Adderall XR, Ritalin, Vyvanse, Concerta, T3, Deplin, and BC pills. I'm on Provigil now, and my psychiatrist plans to add Pamerol today. If that doesn't work, an MAOI is next. After that, who knows? I've also tried exercise, acupuncture, and a zillion different vitamins. So far I haven't had any luck.

Now, the obvious next step here would be ECT, but all of the psychiatrists I've seen have been pretty pessimistic about its chances of helping me. Like, I'll do it when they tell me to, but I'm not holding my breath on that one. I gotta have a backup plan.

Problem is, I'm not really sure where to go from here. There doesn't seem to be a lot of information out there about what to do when all of the conventional treatments fail. Right now I'm trying to switch to a healthier diet, with the ultimate goal of eliminating most processed foods and simple carbs. It's slow going, as you can imagine, especially since I can't eat 90% of vegetables. Beyond that, I don't really know what I should be doing. I was wondering whether any of you nice sad people were in the same situation, or had any ideas to share. I'd also love if anyone had a link to online resources which could help, especially if it was another subreddit. Thank you so much!"
do,"I'm epileptic and have always lived by the idea that having a laugh about problems is the best way to deal with them. Being diagnosed as epileptic and the problems it has led to is probably the worst thing that's happened to me. So I think it's a good basis for my first tattoo. I love the quote and personally love the ""seizure"" pun. Seen pictures of a tattoo of a brain with a lightning bolt through it as an epilepsy reference, just as a reference point for the sort of thing I like. I'd really appreciate any input or advice from people who are more knowledgeable on the subject."
do,"Hey all,

Just wanted to put down some thoughts I've had today. Not fully fleshed out but here goes: 

Diagnosed OCD/Tourette’s Syndrome (neurological disorders of the brain) as a kid.

Took medications (SSRI and fast acting stimulant) as a teenager, stopped taking at 19 because father drilled into head that I didn’t need them. Supressed this memory due to trauma regarding father as a teenager.

Started drinking alcohol at 18 (first drink). Uncontrollable binge drinking.

Experimented with other drugs but stayed mostly away because thought drugs made you a bad person, stuck to alcohol (social justification).

Depression, major challenges with financial, social, legal, spiritual, mental and physical health but still very high functioning with school and work.

NSLC being closed over Christmas led to return to cough syrup (stimulant), allowed to think clearly.

Last week put together link between OCD/Tourettes (which alcohol helped numb, thought I had gotten over them) and chemical deficiencies of the brain, led me to look into link between neurological and mood disorders. Lack of dopamine leads to a permanent baseline chemical deficiency. Read about link between cough syrup abuse and bi-polar disorder.

Had 4 cups of coffee yesterday, scattered thinking and unable to work well. Too much stimulant leads to blackouts like alcohol does.

Stopped drinking alcohol (depressant) and cough syrup (stimulant) as of January 1, 2018.

Migraine headache present most of past 6 years finally gone.
I need AA/NA and the people here more than ever. I’ve found a path to my higher power and understand now. I am happy for the first time in likely a decade or more.

Today I don’t have the compulsion to drink or use drugs that I have had since about 18 years old.  34 now. A bit of anger that I couldn't see this all prior to today but know I can't hold onto that anger or it will drive me back to compulsion.

Thank you very much ."

""I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie, and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.""

Okay, this is classic Dwight behavior. But does anyone know what movie he's referencing? I've watched The Office through at least five times, and this is one of the little things that has always bugged me.

The only movie I can think of that he may be referring to is The Devil's Rejects... but that's just off the top of my head. Any other ideas?

Thanks for any input!"
do,"I don't remember much about this game, but I saw a let's play of it a few years ago. It can't be more than like 7 years old. The art style is dark and cartoony, similar to Don't Starve, and the story takes place over the course of several days where this spiky, red-haired mad scientist looking boy goes from room to room in his house, turning on lights. I remember there being a time where the generator goes off or something and he has to go turn it on before it's too late."
do,"Alright, so I've been dating this chick since about April and she's kinda gone cold on me. We hit the first three off pretty well, went to an outdoor concert, she let me have the honor of cooking for her, and we hit up a mall and went to see The Avengers and we talk. A lot. Anyway, she has some depth to her and she is a socially awkward type like me, introverted. Anyway this past date, about two weeks ago went great. She was talking about having a movie night/day over here, and I took that as her wanting to see me again. So Father's Day goes by, and she tells me shes going to be with her dad, cool. So come Thursday, I've been dropping a few clues saying I'm not going to be doing much this weekend, I'm going to be doing jack shit on Saturday, I kind of wanted her to take the lead a little on dating activity ideas and whatnot, and by Thursday night I outright ask her to come over Saturday for movie night and she tells me she doesn't know what she's doing this weekend. So I take that as her passively not wanting to come over. So the next day (Friday) I texted that we should probably stop seeing each other and she agrees. And that has been the end of any correspondence between us. I tried to keep the line open by saying if she feels that she is ready to date that she has my number. 

A few other things about this girl, her last relationship (roughly two years ago) ended in a tragedy and she has voiced to me that she likes/wants to take things very slow. This was after I tried to take her hand on the second date and she didn't ""hold"" back. On the third date I asked if I could kiss her, since I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable or rush her, and it was just really awkward. She told me that it was a little weird because that was what the guy in her previous relationship did when he first kissed her. 

So, did I do the right thing? I feel like I ended it a little cold, but from what she tells me, she felt she wasn't ready to date. I really really dig this gal, but I never felt any compassion back from her and I had to come to terms that I felt that it wasn't going anywhere. Hardest text message I had to type in my whole life to be honest."
do,"Dear Rhys,

I have to start this off by saying I am so proud of you.

So, so proud. 

It's been over three years since I became a fan of work and neither you nor I could ever anticipate how you changed my life forever. But in these three years, I have watched you grow from a comedian that no one knew about to one who sold out their two Edinburgh Fringe runs, received their first five star review, a radio slot, a couple of tv appearances, a presenter for a series on Sky and tomorrow is the first episode of 11 where you'll be on tv on a weekly basis. I'm so excited to see it that I nearly cry every time I see the advert (but not in a weird way, I promise).

I've told you before how you changed my life for the better. Introducing me the comedy industry was the best thing anyone could've ever done for me. I've found happiness and friends here and you found me (ha, lucky you). I've met you so many times and all our photos are on my wall. 

But this letter is really for about right now. For what's been going on in my life recently. You don't know this, but two weeks ago I suffered a traumatic event which left me with suspected PTSD and truth be told, it's taken over my life. I don't know how to cope with what happened. I've been having flashbacks and I can't always sleep and I can't always talk to anybody. My days have been blowing away with my mind being somewhere else, but you have been my anchor, slowly bringing me back to the Earth whenever I drift too far.

I lean on you when my emotions have slipped out of my grasp. I watch your videos, go through your blog, your tweets, listen to your playlist and my mind slows down. Stops racing. I start to breathe again. Especially the other night, when I was crying so hard I could barely breathe and my hands were shaking as I typed ""hey, are you busy? Can you talk for 5 minutes?"" in a message to you and you got back to me in no time at all with ""what's up?"".

I've told you before about my history with self-injury and I've been really struggling lately. I feel like I have a promise to you after you helped me through the tough times before, so I've started the butterfly project again and drawn a butterfly named after you. It's helped more than you could ever know. 

Have I ever told you that you saved my life? It's a bold statement, I know, but I wouldn't say it if it weren't true. My life is a weird mess right now but you've stopped me sinking into the darkness that so desperately calls out my name, because when I think about ending it all I don't go any further than that because I think of you. I owe you so much and I can't repay you if I'm six feet under. And weirdly enough, I'm thankful to see all this happening. I hope it makes me stronger in the end. 

As we transition from comedian-fan to something closer to friends, I have to say that it's probably not healthy to rely on you like this but you have never let me down and I am so grateful. I could say 'thank you' a million times over and it wouldn't be enough for how much I mean it. 

I'm going to get there in the end and it'll be thanks to you. Thank you for keeping me here. I love you.

See you tomorrow (on tv, obviously)

Sophie"

Does anyone know of a resource that might list the movies offered by Delta in previous months? Thanks in advance!"
do,"Hello, I don't know if anybody is reading this, if you are, thank you. You may know that my name is Sam. This is my stupid story. 

Early on, life was fantastic. I was a very gifted child, my parents held me high and were always beaming with pride. I smiled constantly, my only worry was tarnishing my perfect reputation at school. Then the economy crashed when I was about 9, my father had to make more and more work trips to keep his company afloat, even though his work was really more of a hobby than anything, my mother was the one keeping us in our nice house with our organic food. Regardless, my father was not present, and when he was, he was stretched thin, he would snap at us about anything one minute, and then be the nicest guy in the world the next. Nevertheless, I still flourished in school. Socially, I was far more advanced than the majority of my peers, I spoke with eloquence when addressing adults, and constantly received praise for my vocabulary. But, as time marched on, and as I matured, my intelligence was really only recognized in writing, I fell behind in math and science, and the interest I had once held for music waned. My parents tried to incentivize me, but their bribes were in vain, I couldn't pay attention anymore. This was not for lack of trying, I tried so hard to keep my focus and work hard, but it just didn't come to me. Later on in middle school, I was diagnosed with ADHD, which gave some explanation for my recent struggles. I went on a series of stimulants, each one making me more irritable, anxious and antisocial than the last. I kept on flailing in my school work, I played a lot of videogames and ate junk food, my once scrawny frame was now quite bulky. I had manboobs, and I was ridiculed. Highschool promised a new start for me, new opportunities and less rules, but I was unprepared. Freshman year was difficult, I fell behind and caught up, only to be sucked into a sense of false-security and fall behind again, it was a vicious cycle. It was the summer after this long year in which my parents revealed they were getting a divorce. I was okay with it, it wasn't like I didn't expect it, with the atmosphere which my father created in the house. I really didn't mind. It was when the new year started when everything went to shit, the year started as usual, great and easy, however, the usual shit began to happen. I fell behind because all of my time was consumed by a girl with more baggage than the TSA, so I was naturally behind. I fell into bad habits. I began smoking, a little at first, then much much more, in a stupid attempt to deal with the stress. I fell into a motivation-less depression, I had ups and downs, the ups were so high I thought I was better, then I would crash and think about suicide because I thought I had failed myself, not that my mental illness had gotten the best of me. And that leads me to today, a few weeks before the end of sophomore year. Today was mothers day, I got really high last night, I didn't want to think about everything I had to do. I felt like shit this morning, I bitched at my mom the whole way there and refused to get out of the car, I disassociated very badly and began to freak out. We argued the whole way, I wanted to make a card for my mom, but I forgot because I was getting high and binging on junk food to forget. my grades are shit, I went from the brilliant kid to the bottom of the barrel of the honors program. I have thrown away or had everything taken that I had. I don't think this brain fits in this world. I can't keep doing this. 

I don't know what I'm going to do, part of me thinks about ending it just to spare me and everyone else the  trouble. If this going to be life, life doesn't have a purpose.  

I just want someone there."
do,"This is my first time posting. I’ll give a little background info:

F/24
Diagnosed with Clinical Depression at 15 years old

So I’ve been depressed since 6 grade. I used to regularly self-harm. I don’t do it as much as I used to, but when I get severely overwhelmed I will do it. But that’s not what this post is about.

So while in high school I briefly saw this psychiatrist for my depression. I remember causally mentioning I can’t concentrate in school. He said I had ADD and prescribed my medication for it. It had negative side effects so I quit cold turkey. Never thought too much about it again.

All throughout college and university, I’ve struggled with procrastination and not focusing in my classes. I would daydream while in class(been doing this since elementary school. Didn’t think much of it). While in college, I would procrastinate on essays, and basically anything that I had to do outside of school. Most times I would just not turn in work then get anxiety knowing that I should work on it, but I still wouldn’t. As a result my grades suffered.

I just thought I wasn’t into my major anymore and decided to go to beauty school, as I am pursuing that as a career now. I pass my tests(we do reviews right before the quiz so I just try to cram and remember), and I do well on the practicals, but I just cannot bring myself to actually study correctly. I just write the info for the grade, not actually retaining any information. This isn’t good as I want to be the best in my field. But how Can I be the best if I’m not retaining the information?

So I’ve been seeing my current psychiatrist for over 5 years. He prescribed me Latuda for my depression, Ativan for anxiety, and Ambien because I have trouble falling asleep at night(I’m an over thinker by nature and its hard to get my mind to settle).

He never really stated what Latuda is, he just prescribed it to my because I was having major mood swings. I would get really sad then angry then be ok for a short while, then repeat. Everyday. The Latuda has been helping tremendously with this so I’m sticking to it. I currently take 80mg.

So today, I told him about how I strongly identify with some of the posts on this subreddit. I told him about my procrastination and my inability to pay attention and sit down and complete work. So he prescribed me strattera, mentioned some of the side effects, and that’s it. My appointment was for 10am and I was back in my car at 10:10am.

I was hoping for more information on this, like do I have ADD? Are these just symptoms of depression? If they are, why has none of the numerous medication I’ve taken over the years helped? Idk I don’t like that I still have no questions answered. I just feel like he threw medication at me and that was it. 

I will began searching for a new psychiatrist.

I just needed to vent. I’ve tried researching on my own but I know very little about ADD, it’s connection with depression, and if I have it. 

☹️"
do,"For me it's Discovery. There's a multitude of reasons why, the primary one being that it was the first album I ever owned. My dad bought it for me when I was 6, and I fell in love with it immediately. I have such an ear for electronic music now, and it's all because I got this amazing album when I was young. At the risk of sounding like a douche, I make music, and my main dream is to be the inspiration that Daft Punk was (and still is) to me and my music. If it wasn't for the robots, I wouldn't be making music today. I have Discovery to thank for my favorite hobby."
do,"I have tried to self-analyze my persistent depression, and while I do not discount the role that neurochemistry and hormones play, I have noticed that my most recurring problem is the problem of ""thought-loops.""

My depression symptoms first began getting very severe in the Army, so I'll give an example from my time in service. A typical thought-loop would go something like this:

1. I am watching TV.
2. I have to go to bed soon to get up for work tomorrow.
3. I have so little free time because of the Army.
4. This show isn't worth watching if you're in the Army because you have so little free time. Any show you watch in the Army has to be amazing because you have so little free time.
5. I cannot think of any worthwhile shows; all television is bullshit and a waste of time.
6. I hate my job because I have so little free time.
7. All television is bullshit and a waste of time.
8. I hate my job because I have so little free time.

And then those last two thoughts would just repeat themselves over and over. Soon, I'll just be sitting there thinking about how much I hate TV and hate my job until I fall asleep.

Of course, this is a very immature and unrealistic way to think, but every time I let myself get caught in this loop I would reinforce the mindset and the behavior.

Now, though, I am out of the Army, but I still have those same thought-loops. Hell, it's almost impossible for me to watch TV without having that exact same thought play through my head: all television is bullshit and a waste of time. If someone asks me to watch TV, I just sit there with a sour look on my face waiting for the show to end.

I used TV as an example, but the list goes on and on. Eating food you enjoy is bullshit because you get fat/I hate having a weak body that gets fat from food/Repeat. Playing video games is bullshit because it takes up so much time/I hate how much time it takes to enjoy things because life is short/Repeat. Being in a relationship or having friends is bullshit because then you have to spend time with them instead of doing what you want to do/Life is short and spending time with people means you won't do anything with your life/Repeat. 

All absurd thoughts that I've allowed myself to ruminate on so long that they're my default reaction to everything.

My question is twofold: 1) does this describe anyone else's experience? Does anyone else feel like they've thought-looped the fun out of anything in life? 2) Does anyone have any experience breaking these habits?

On some level, I imagine that you could try substituting a more beneficial and life-affirming feedback loop. Has anyone tried this? Has anyone had any success? Is it better to approach this systematically (purposely putting yourself in situations with a certain mantra) or reactively (noticing the negative thoughts and then drowning them out with more positive ones)? What has worked? What has not?"

do,"Hi guys, I'm graduating college in May and my family is planning an excursion in Europe to celebrate. Kind of completely lost..

Ultimately seeking somewhere close to big waterfront and preferably on the warmer end. We will be staying for a few days in a city and then renting a villa in the countryside/beach-side/wherever. We don't really do hotels or resorts, we've always just rented apartments and houses, if that makes any difference. 
We spend most of our time outdoors walking/hiking/general exploring. 

Right now my mom is pushing for three nights in Paris and then spending a week renting a villa in the French countryside, mainly with us then exploring the French Riviera.

I'm a little hesitant regarding Paris as if I've heard it's kind of trashy and the whole immigrant stuff going on. Maybe it's just silly, but I really don't know much beyond what the media crams down my throat, so any opinions regarding it and whatnot would be great. We're kind of the whitest family around. 

The French riviera looks pretty nice, but I don't know anyone who's been there. 


Anyhow, any particularly family-friendly destinations people know of or recommend with both an urban and country appeal? Nearer to beaches is a plus. We did Rome and rented a villa in Tuscany before and that was a good experience, albeit a little chilly."
do,"Venting can be vague, right? It's like I just had my biggest insecurity and fear confirmed to me. They said they were different, these things didn't matter. Maybe they're just shallow or I'm overreacting but I just feel like they hate me right now. Everything reminds me of them and it feels like my heart is breaking. I don't know how to confront people and I'm tired of annoying people when I get into my depressing and self conscious moods but they're happening so often again I have no choice than to isolate myself once again. I really thought things were changing, looking up for once. I was ready to embrace my insecurities but being so open with someone hurts you so much when they let you down. Things need to change, I guess everything really was my fault. I don't know where to go from here. I've never done anything like this, I've always kept to myself, even in a place that is anonymous. I don't know what I'm doing anymore."

do,"I am not entirely sure where to start... I have been dating guys hours away from my home town for awhile now.  I got sick of lying to my parents about where I was, thinking about what if something bad happened... so I came out to my parents a few months ago, around November last year iirc.  Mind you, I live in a bible belt area, so I was not expecting things to go well at all.  At first, things were fine; I came out to my mom and she had a basic ""not mad, just disappointed"" talk with me and told me she still cared for me as her son.  My dad was rather quiet about the whole thing.  Fast forward to now. I was talking to my dad about visiting someone even further away, when he finally expresses his (100% negative) feelings about the situation.  He said things like ""we didnt raise you up to be like this..."".  Now, here is where my asking for advice begins.

They are not forcing me out of the house, but every day has become more and more toxic to my mental health.  I am getting stressed to the point of it affecting my daily routines at work and home.  I am considering moving out and living with any friend who would be willing to take me in.  I don't have much money saved up(just a little over a grand...), but I do have good/relevant job experience.  I am also a college graduate.  My current job does not pay enough for me to move into an apartment, or even to pay rent at a friends place.  My plan right now is to try and find someone lives in an area where I could find a good paying job, but that is so absurdly hopeful... I am not sure what to do at this point.

Any advice, as far as maybe patching things up with family, job searching, rooming with friends, etc would be appreciated.  Im so lost right now I dont know what options are available to me, and don't know where to begin to search.

UPDATE: talked with my brother, he is actually offering me a place to stay and help me get on my feet!  It's a long travel, and I got a few things to take care of back home, but it's looking really positive so far.

do,"To get over my rocky relationships (mostly with parents, a psychopathic ex-boyfriend/best friend, and friends that suffered from borderline personality disorder or were suicidal), I travelled, worked hard at my career, learned a new language and spent a lot of time in counselling as well as self-reflection.

However, after several years of this, I'm admitting defeat. It doesn’t matter where I go, what I see, what I learn, what I do, what goals I aim for. Nothing means anything (not an exaggeration). I just want to feel loved and safe in this life. If everything else disappeared I wouldn’t care and instead I’d be relieved, but who’s going to love someone who does nothing but love them, and what if I find love but still feel this way? Do you think my expectations of love are too high and I essentially want someone else to be my rescuer? I have been diagnosed with reactive depression and it is risky for me to go on medication for biogenetic reasons.

**tl;dr** Often, my close relationships with people have been dramatic and confusing, or outright abusive. I tried to regain control over my life and be less dependant on others or my ability to help others, but it only made me feel like life is meaningless. Everything numbs me or tires me out but I yearn for that feeling of safety and ability to express intimacy/love/care towards another person in a romantic relationship.

do,"OK, so the guy I'm with is literally everything i want in someone. We've been friends through one of my exes since I was 18, I'm 27 now and we've kept in contact, but nothing weird. Just friends. We've kept in touch, but very, very rarely. Like, we would see each other in town with our SOs, and hang out, but I knew there was always something there, but we never acted on it because we were loyal to the people we were currently with. I was with his friend for about 2.5 years. He apparently stopped hanging out with him when we broke up (apparently they grew a part and he realized he wasn't someone he wanted to be friends with) except for when my ex was constantly telling me he was going to kill himself. Long story short, we were both in toxic relationships. (He has a 4 year old with this pathological, psychotic GIRL, I don't ever call her by her first name because i have no respect for her) ANYWAYS, we started dating in June of 2014, and I can't even describe how fucking amazing we are together. We have soooo much in common from sense of humor, music, art and having dead parents. We've gone through a lot of changes in both our lives. I used to be very independent, did what I want kind of girl. He on the other hand had to grow up more quickly, via having a kid with a crazy person. He really is the love of my life.

I lost my mom to various cancers when I was 19. Fucked me up a lot. I used to take anti-depressants/ anti-anxiety for it. Stopped taking them pretty much right after my mom died. (why?) There is too much backstory to this that I would be happy to provide, if asked. Bf lost his dad one month before we started dating...

Recently, I can't say exactly if we're ""on the rocks"",(even though he has broken up with me, as ""wake up-call"" about me drinking) but we have been arguing more.
Mostly dumb shit. Back track a little to something I haven't mentioned much, but I like drinking. A lot. I don't like drinking in heavy amounts anymore, and I avoid hard liquor because of things I've done in the past. 

I've cutdown/ stopped doing numerous things (despite wanting to do them all the time) because I know it's time to be an adult. I wasn't out of control or anything, and my bf and I have done drugs, got fucked up together and had really great times doing so. (Molly, coke weed, drinking)

So now, I've been lucky enough to have the most wonderful, man of my dreams help me with finishing school. (I quit my job to focus on graphic/ web design) He has very well paying contracting jobs, and just recently accepted a job with one, if not, the biggest graphic design company in our county.

I am so happy for him! It's everything he could want! Health insurance, paid time off, weekends off. At the same time he used to work from home. We would spend all day together having sex, doing homework, showing each other dumb videos, just being together. I'm not at all mad about his job, but I, in return, I barely see him. (Remember I'm not working currently because I'm full time at school)

So we are always super open with each other about everything. We talk about stupid random shit, laugh, cry, when we're sad, ect...

Recently, I feel pushed away. Like I said, I'm only in school full time/ going to the gym 4-5 days a week. I get that when he comes home he would want some alone time. Since he has started this job, he'll come home around 6:30, go straight to the room and not speak a word to me.

I clean, make him lunch when he comes home, put out, ask how his new job is without trying to be super annoying. (I just want to know!) But more than half the time, he'll come home after work, walk right by me, doesn't say a word, and goes on his phone for the majority of time left we have together..

Keep in mind he has his son Fri-Sun so I extra don't get to see him, or talk about important things, because I don't want to irritate him..and while I do spend time with him and his son, I am getting completely shut out of our daily lives.

I've tried mentioning this to him lightly, but now I get the eye-roll, omg, look...It's really hard for me because I do so much, and now I get nothing in return. 

There is a bit more to this, but if anyone has questions, like i stated above, I would be happy to answer...

I don't want to lose him. But I am feeling pushed away and when I talk to him about it, he doesn't really understand where I am coming from...How do I talk to him without him feeling annoyed at me?"
do,"I understand that depending on alcohol in any sense is the definition of alcoholism, but I feel like if my depression is eventually gone that I won't need alcohol anymore; I just use it to get out of my dark pits that I feel like I can't climb out of. Sorry if this question seems stupid."
do,"I always kinda feel this societal pressure to cheerlead my parents' relationship. Does anyone else feel that way? Like you're supposed to actively celebrate the relationship your parents have? You're supposed to be like ""oh yeah they taught me everything about love and trust, etc."" or else you'll be seen as an an ungrateful kid for lack of a better word?

I never want to end up like my parents, particularly my mother. Now I love my mother and I have so much respect for her, but the life that she actively chose is not for me at all. The idea of having a similar or same life that my mother had makes me want to kill myself. There is a 15 year age gap between my parents. My mother is the younger one and she recently said that she overlooked a lot when she decided to marry my father to which I said, ""no fucking shit"". My father is much older, quite religious, very stubborn, can't do anything with modern technology, and is very difficult to live with. The more time passes, the more I realize how my mom really settled out of pure desperation. My mother wanted children, because her childhood life was turbulent and severely dysfunctional so when your family is dysfunctional you go and create your own. Because of this, I really feel like I am broken as a human being. I really feel like I can't have normal relationships with people. 

They are also quite over-bearing as parents, so I always feel like I'll never be able to do stuff on my own. I fear that when I finally have freedom I will go overboard and completely just throw everything way because I was never able to experience freedom and responsibility in a healthy fashion. 

Can anyone relate?"
do,"So today we had to do group project (electronics), and the project had to be done in groups of three. 

I knew that I would be the odd one out, so I just started my own group. 

Group members: Me, Myself, and I. 

It was hard doing everything by my own, but the lecturer was SUPER helpful. I had a bajillion questions and he answered them ALL. Never sighing, not even once. Huge respect for that man.

In the end I completed it correctly and I couldn't be more proud of myself.

This is an old joke—but I'm a strong Asian man who don't need nobody!"
do,"I tried searching for a BPD subreddit, with no success. And every single post regarding BPD and relationships outside of this subreddit are all very BPD-bashing, and go along the lines of, ""Leave that crazy bitch!""

I am a 19 year old female with Borderline Personality Disorder. Trying to keep this post short, I won't get into my life story or anything. But I grew up with a very dysfunctional family. Past emotional, physical, and sexual abuse from my father at a young age. I was in therapy for 10 years of my life, been in and out of Psychiatric Hospitals, was in a lock down treatment center for one year of my life, and have been on various medications. I have been diagnosed with Major Depression, Bipolar Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and lastly Borderline Personality Disorder. Having done every Psychological Evaluation possible, I have been undiagnosed with everything except for BPD and Major Depression.

I am very nervous about posting all of that information, because re-reading it, I really do sound like a nutcase. Truthfully, I lead a very normal life. I live with roommates, hold a steady job, am finally going to school (studying psychology!), and you would never guess my history from interacting with me. I haven't taken any medication or participated in any therapy for almost two years, preferring to take a more holistic route through Yoga, Meditation, a healthy diet, and exercise.

For the most part, I've been doing a lot better. That is, when I'm not dealing with any form of relationship. Over the past year, for various reasons, both mine and the other's faults, I have lost every single relationship I had held onto. I got out of a terrible one year relationship. (He cheated on with me with my best friend.) Of course, drama ensued and long story short, with the mix of that fucked-upness and my fucked-upness, I lost the small circle of friends that I did have. In a way, that ""traumatized"" me into steering clear of all connections. For the most part, I have stayed away from society this past year, and though it's lonely, it's been quite more peaceful that way.

Back in April, I began dating somebody. He's a bit older, 24, and because I feared growing any form of connection, I kept it very casual. I made it very clear to him that nothing serious was going to happen between us, and that he essentially was a really good friend that I went on dates with, cuddled with, etc. He's been extremely fond of me since we first started seeing each other, and asked me to be his girlfriend multiple times throughout the months. Out of fear of getting hurt again, and most importantly, the fear of me pushing away yet another person, I kept telling him no. Of course, walls broke down bit by bit. Talks became more intimate, and after sleeping together, I of course completely broke past my block and have started becoming attached. We officially became a couple last month. Now, he isn't completely oblivious to my secret. We have had quite a few deep conversations. He knows that I was hospitalized and put in treatment. (I had told him beforehand that it was a boarding school.) He also knows that I was formerly diagnosed with things, and still am with depression. He is extremely supportive, has seen me in some of my worst states, and has been so incredibly patient, caring, calm, and empathetic.

Reddit, *I don't want to lose this.*

I don't want to manipulate him. I don't want to sabotage him. I don't want to drive him into insanity with my mood swings and emotional breakdowns. He keeps saying he won't leave, that he supports me, and that he understands, but as fellow sufferers of depression and BPD, I'm sure many of you have heard that before, as have I. Another thing that worries me, is that depression and suicide are very sensitive topics to him due to trauma over his best friend killing himself, and him witnessing it. I had just about cried when I heard that. And the last fucking thing I would ever want to do is trigger a bad memory for him, or hurt him in any way.

It seems that I do fine on my own. I'm very independent. It's as if I have nothing to lose. But now, I do have something to lose, and that makes me go into this day after day avalanche of emotions, and attachment, and being scared of abandonment, and hating myself for feeling these things. Part of me thinks that I should've just left things as they were, kept my independence and stayed home reading Sylvia Plath while cuddling with my cat. But then another part of me tells me I've never had somebody so wonderful in my life and I would be stupid to pass that up. BUT WAIT, my brain continues to go on. You'll drive him away anyways with how fucked up you are!

Okay, okay. I know I'm ranting now. To the point... Is there anyone else out there with Borderline Personality Disorder who knows how to hold a healthy relationship, or a recovered BPD who has advice? Or even somebody who has or is dating someone with BPD who knows how to cope? Should I tell him about it? If so, how? Any form of advice. I don't have health insurance, I can't afford certain therapies that I know would benefit, so this is the best I've got. If you've read this far, you're a saint. Or you're just incredibly bored. Either way, thank you."
do,"So, 2 months ago I was diagnosed with depression with an OCD element. 

I've struggled on and off with intrusive existential thoughts for years, but it only really got bad this past summer. An episode of *The West Wing* with a death in it suddenly triggered an awful anxious episode, and since then I've been depressed and obsessed with concepts like death, God, and eternity. 

I literally can't stop thinking about them. The drugs have helped, but not a whole lot. The only way to make the obsessive thoughts stop is to indulge them by reading about religion. I had to drop out of university in my first semester because I wasn't getting any work done or even going to classes - I had no defense against the intrusive thoughts.

Since then, things have been getting a bit better, but I'm still nowhere near a normal life. I work as a cashier and I need to leave my register every hour or so because I have to get just a quick fix of religious content online. The worst of it was about two weeks ago, when I landed in the ER after smoking some marijuana... apparently, the intrusive thoughts mixed with the hallucinations, and it didn't go well. I apparently told the security officer that I was checking in to the ER because ""Jesus and Satan are fighting for my soul."" Thankfully, they knew right away that I was having some sort of episode and got me the treatment I needed.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't even know why I'm posting this, I just need it off my chest. I wake up every morning and the thoughts are already there waiting for me - ""God's not real. And even if he is, he hates you. And even if he doesn't, can you imagine *eternity?* How terrible is existence, right?"" And it *does not stop.* All day, and all night. I really can't sleep at night because of it, either.

I'm trying to find a way out, but there just is none. I don't know that there's a solution, but no one really understands what I'm going through and hopefully someone here can at least relate."
do,"I've been taking Vyvanse 60mg for severe ADHD for a few months now, before I was taking Adderall XR, but it did not last long enough, even at higher doses. With Adderall, I experienced an extreme crash, though it was not a depressed crash, just a tired, ""I need a 2 hour nap"" type deal. As of recently, Vyvanse has not only been giving me the same crash as Adderall, but I have begun to sink into severe depression, especially when it begins to wear off around 1:00pm. I have begun to workout significantly less since I started ADHD meds about 5 months ago, and its become even more difficult to workout, which I love doing, because Vyvanse is worsening my already severe chronic depression and causing horrible anxiety. My depression is already being treated with Zoloft 50mg. A little backgroud; I am a 17 y/o guy, quite tall, but skinny and have lost almost 8 pounds in 1.5 months because of Vyvanse, which my doctor is monitoring closely.

How do I help ease the comedown? I have read that exercising can reduce the side effects of amphetamine comedowns. How true is that? If there is a factual basis in that statement, could my decrease in working out be strengthening the comedown?

I have talked to the doctor about my crashes, with the worsening depression being something that has recently begun happening within the past few weeks.

Edit: I should add that the depression from the comedown is quite awful and feels as though I have not taken my Zoloft... suicidal, worthless, bored, unamused."

do,"I began a game as holland because I love the dutch ideas, government, and position. But I've run myself into a difficult position and was wondering if anyone had any ideas.

I used france, england, austria to get independence, got a decent ruler, took breda, peaced out of burgundy and slowly took the rest of the dutch provinces and east frisia. My goal for this game to unite the low countries up to picardie and not expand outside that area in europe. Building a very tall and rich netherlands.

after independence england broke the alliance, I replaced with munster. Eventually I vassalised liege and took calais with frances help in a later war. Austria lost the HRE to Hesse, then the burgundian inheritance fired which I thought was ideal, since I could grab the rest of the low countries from an easy hesse that nobody important liked. Apparently france though the same, and ate all the wallonian low countries + vlanderran and decided they want my other province breaking our alliance.

So it's 1507 I own all dutch provinces + east frisia and calais, liege is a vassal I'll be annexing soon. Hess owns antwerp, ghent,brabant and limburg, though I'm stuck at peace with them until the french warning expires in 1511, England rivaled me so no help there. But I've got a strong alliance with A fairly blobbed austria, a trier and munster both of who I helped expand eastward so they're formidable themselves, and frances rival castille with PU on aragon and naples, which I needed after france broke up with me.

I went exploration, expansion first to get ahead and fill up the ivory coast node as quickly as possible, which is what I've begun doing, but I'm wondering what Mil idea I should take for the third idea, originally I'd planned defensive because of the nice morale boost and other beneficials. But with a hostile france I'm not sure.

I'd also like some opinions on general colonial strategies as the netherlands too that you might have. Originally I planned to go strictly east, Ivory coast, around to asia and bring all that wealth home, and while I still plan on that being my primary focus I was wondering if it were beneficial to take all estuary/trade center provinces in America/caribbean? Only those, to avoid creating a colonial nation that would steal my trade power. 

It seems like it could work, though i worry I wouldn't be able to have enough merchants to steer all that back to channel as I didn't plan on getting trade at all due to all the free merchants from trade companies, and I don't want large colonial nations in those regions.

How do you play the dutch? Is trade ideas worth it? can I beat france out of the low countries? Where do you colonise?"

do,"Hello, I’m a long time lurker. I’ve always considered myself monogamous and have only been in mono relationships, though I’ve been subbed to this subreddit for ages and have always been interested.
I’ve recently started seeing a guy, who was upfront straight away and said he was poly, though not in any long term commitments at the moment. 
It’s fairly casual, so it’s not like I’m completely in love with this guy, but I do care and respect him and we’ve been getting really close. We’ve discussed how we feel and are both content with seeing how it goes forward and both know we like each other.

He told me he had a date this weekend and I immediately felt really really jealous. I just couldn’t help it, even though him and I aren’t even in a relationship. I know he’s not “hiding” it and we’re not exclusive so I don’t have any reason to be upset.  We may not even go anywhere in the future, but I’d like to keep seeing him if I can and I don’t want this to be the thing that “scares me off” so to speak. 

Should I end it now if I’m having these kind of reactions? Is it too early to talk about how it’s making me feel jealous? I want him to be happy, and don’t technically have any reason to not want him to see other people.

I guess I’m just looking for any advice or comments from the people who know how to navigate this, and what you’d want someone to know if you were starting to see a mono person who might be open. I don’t want to mess this up, either by pushing myself into something I’m not comfortable with, or by missing the chance to actually have a relationship or experience I really value and enjoy.

I know the biggest piece of advice is to talk to him and to be open in my communication, but I just don’t know how to word this without feeling stupid. I know I have self esteem issues, and this is probably stemming from that, so I don’t want to drag him down into my own problems if I can help it.

I don't know if it's from my depression or anxiety or something else so I'm asking if anyone else can relate. I know it ain't my anxiety because if it was I'd be afraid of everything.

I don't really fear things, I just dislike them a lot. Like loops on roller coasters and falling and loud noises. Sure, I'll go on a roller coaster and fall and listen to loud noises but I won't enjoy it. At all. I'll hate it so much I'll cry. But it's not exactly *fear*

I *crave* fear, I loved horror since I was a kid. I remember I wrote my first horror story in 3rd-4th grade (and I'm  *still* not good at writing) and when I was in 4th grade the librarian let me take out books that usually they thought were 'too scary' and only gave them to 5th graders. I LOVED this book as a kid and would repeatedly read it over and over and marvel at the pictures - [link](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1325218.Scary_Stories_to_Tell_in_the_Dark)

Also, in elementary school, we went to some colonial town in my area and I was looking around, constantly aware of seeing if there was any ghosts. I even made up a story that I looked through a locked keyhole and saw an eye staring back at me.

I love having nightmares. I go to sleep in anticipation of having one.

I loooove Ouija boards and have used them before, I even tried making my own once.

My favorite subreddits have been /r/creepypasta, /r/scaredshitless, /r/fearme, and all subreddits like that. 

I love watching horror movies constantly and being in abandoned places because it makes me feel like I'm in a horror movie.

A few months ago I got infatuated with the idea of schizophrenia and living in constant fear. I would watch videos of what it would be/feel/sound/look like. 

Also, this was also since I was a kid, I would always say ""I ain't afraid of no one!"" Which is true. I'm a short 5'0"" girl and went in a mosh pit with people over 6"" when I was just 80 lbs. I really would love getting into a fight. I don't care how big or small."

My term papers have snuck up on me. Also, I've been having a hell of a time dealing with the stress. I sit down to read, and I feel as if my reading comprehension has dropped to that of a third grader. Even things I've covered in undergrad are making no sense in my head. I am pretty sure this is a side effect of my inability to handle the stress, coupled with my (clinical) depression sneaking back in. I thought my depression was starting to come back in October, but I didn't want to admit it. I can't see my old psych right now and I put off seeing a new one for too long. Nobody will see me until January. I'm bad with taking my meds and I'm quickly running out anyway. Long story short, I have no demonstrable reading skill and I can't write anything for my papers.

The second is how to actually drop out. I haven't made any friends in this school, and I don't have an official adviser. I'm not sure how to bring it up to anyone at school. I cried when I told my boyfriend, and I am not a crier at all. I don't want to lose it in front of a relative stranger.

I feel like there's nothing I can do to salvage this semester because I can't finish my papers (or even find good sources... or write cogent sentences). My plans are to go back and get another undergrad degree that I can use straight out of the gate. How would failing out of one semester of grad school affect getting in for another undergrad degree (at a different school)? 

It's hurting my soul to stay at this school any longer than I actually have to. It's doing shit to my mental health. I'm falling back into bad habits to deal with the stress (like self-harming). I need to get out of here and into the second round of undergrad.

do,"I am a 19 year old currently attending university. When I was in around 6th or 7th grade I was diagnosed with ADHD [don't know if this is relevant for what's to follow].

Over the past two years I've been experiencing what I thought to be depressive like symptoms. I even went to a therapist and I don't think the whole experience was for me. Thinking it would just pass I stopped attending the therapist (this was earlier this year). Again, the therapy wasn't very helpful. Eventually what I was feeling passed, or at least I thought it did. Every so often I'd experience episodes of very depressive thoughts ranging from feeling extremely lonely and disconnected sometimes angry, and feeling as if no one understood me. However, I am very much not lonely and I am aware of this but the thoughts still consume me during those moments. When these episodes happen I'd essentially have a break down and try to get away from anyone I was with at that moment so that no one saw me. 
But eventually the waves of depressive and angry thoughts would pass and I'd 
be alright. I've had a few of these episodes, and just had one about 15 minutes ago, and it's getting to the point where I don't know how to handle it anymore. I don't want them to escalate and I don't know what it is. 


A lot of times I feel elated and happy, or at least I feel like I do until I have these episodes. I also feel its fair to mention that I don't handle big social situations well (socials,parties) (I'm heavily introverted), and feel that I have difficulty finding the courage to speak to people at times. That being said, in high school and among my group of friends I am considered the loud, and funny one and I can agree with that as that's the person I always put on display around them. 


I've always usually kept how I feel on the inside except for a certain few people, but talking about it with them doesn't seem to do anything for me anymore

**1. How do I break?**
I've read so many posts on this, but none of them are really clear. I need step-by-step instructions on how to do various breaks.

**2. Any tips for a beginner?**
I'll be going to a tennis court at 7am to teach myself if the weather is good (goddamn British weather!). Any tips will be appreciated.

**3. Is it at all possible to skate on cracked pavement or does the ground have to be completely smooth?**
If you read my details below, you'll see that I mentioned I fell and ""landed on my ass in the middle of the street"" because I was skating on cracked pavement. It was not fun.

**4. How do I slow down?**




Details on my skating history/goals:
I bought a pair of inline skates four ago thinking skating was going to be like riding a bike. I learnt the hard way that it isn't. I used to skate all the time as a kid but now, 10 years later (I'm 18), I've completely forgotten. I landed on my ass in the middle of a street with much traffic when I first attempted to skate with my current ones. This was four months ago and ever since I refused to touch them until now.

While I imagine it will end up being an activity that I do casually, my current goals are essentially weight loss (about 20lbs) and to learn to skate safely without having to depend on a fence or lampost to keep me from falling every five seconds. Eventually I want to be able to skate in public without endangering the innocent pedestrians. I can be a lethal when I'm clumsy.

I have wrist guards, knee pads, and a bit of a deathwish so I'm not too afraid of landing on my ass a thousand times until I get the hang of it."
do,"I stupidly went out to run some quick errands today assuming the snow would fall when the forecasters predicted.

The snow hit just as my daughters gym class ended. Unperturbed I parked up at King Soopers in Centennial to do my groceries and when I came back out laden with shopping and two hungry and chilly kids, my car battery was flat. Dead. Kaput.

So, now I have a car going nowhere, no coats or blankets, and two cold and scared kids.

I tried a few friends on my mobile, but no one was in or answering their phones, then my network dropped out.

I got out of the car (in a t-shirt and jeans) and looked under the hood to see if there was anything I could do.

The guy parked in the space in front of me got out of his car to check what was up. He too had a flat battery and was waiting on a friend to come and give him a jumpstart. 

When his friend arrived, they tried to start my car first, but it was completely flat and we thought maybe the alternator was gone. They offered me a ride and a coat, but I didn't have anyway to get the car later, even if I called a tow.

I spotted an old Brakes Plus sticker on the car and called them from the superstore (they let me use their phone!) as I knew they were just across the block from where I was. The guy on the phone was very sweet and when I explained I had the kids with me and no coats etc, he offered to come over to the car park to see what he could do.
He brought his own jumpstart pack, but the car was still completely dead.

He drove us over to the garage waiting room, gave the kids candy and drinks, me coffee and obviously most important - access to the restroom! He then went back over to the car park to fit a new battery and drove my car back to me at the shop.

The people I met today were so helpful and kind, I just had to come and say Thank You Denverites for being so lovely :)"
do,"So I have had two surgeries since august 2016. They found stage four endo. My second surgery was in December. A few months after that and I have been feeling a lot better. When I get pain it's not as intense and it's not all the time like normal. Last night I found out my dad was rushed to the er. Now he is in the ICU recovering from a stroke and fall that broke his back. Emotionally I feel more numb than stressed. I get migraines that are triggered from stress. Now though, my endo pain seems to be flaring up bad. Could it be due to the stress. My doctor hasn't given me anything for pain management. Would it be worth going to the doctor for something to help? I just don't want to waste the money to go if it wouldn't be worth it."
do,"In trying to cope with heartbreak, I just need to remember the beginning. Not two months ago when we started dating, but eight years ago. Sitting at HuHot eating dessert rangoons at my brother's birthday. Looking at this boy who was too handsome to be my brother's friend. With his perfect teeth and laughing brown eyes and overwhelming natural charm.

Fast forward, helping move into the house we live in now. Moving furniture and making jokes, but still being too young to really know how to approach a boy. Innocent, shy, and naive.

And then sitting in the basement that is now my bedroom but was then a game room. Listening to music - offspring, slipknot, system of a down, everything - and playing video games. Talking about anything.

Going to cemeteries when I got into high school. ""Ghost hunting"" until ungodly hours. Trespassing at Menninger's. All the while watching him fall in and out of love with other girls.

We used to drive around with my brother. Go to echo cliff each with our own 2 liter of Mountain Dew. He would always help me up if I slipped. Or give me his jacket when I was cold.

And then I took a risk.

Started texting him and talking to him and we started our own friendship. Not one that made us friends through my brother, but friends in our own right.

And it wasn't long before we started talking about being more than friends. Feelings got involved.

And then a summer of house arrest. Where he visited me almost every day. And a tent in the back yard where he kissed me for the first time and held me while I cried. That's the summer I realized I was in love. And I was so mad when I realized it. He went to boot camp that summer. I waited for him.

When he got back, things were different. I thought I'd lost him. He didn't care about me and everything he'd said had been a lie. I spent a winter hurting over him.

The next spring we reconciled. Things weren't necessarily the same, but it was ok. We were friends again. We went to Rockfest together. The Pretty Reckless, Korn, and Killswitch Engage. He probably saved me from getting trampled to death a thousand times that day. It's still my favorite day of my entire life.

And then we were working together and he lived with my brother and I could see him always. Got to fall asleep in his arms a few nights. I always felt safe. I've missed those nights desperately since 2014.

Then he and my brother had a falling out. I was torn. My brother, or the man I'd fallen in love with. I didn't really ever choose. But he and I kept talking. We cultivated a relationship of our own. He was my safe place even if he wasn't ever mine to claim.

He took me on our first date July 1, 2015. I was arrested just over a week later.
We weren't a couple while I was in jail. But he answered when I called. He showed up to my court date. He came to visit me the day I got out. He never gave up on me.

When I got out he took me on another date. And then we became a couple. And then I screwed it up.

But if I can forget that. If I can remember everything else we ever were before I got out. I can get through this. No one will ever see him the way I do. I still look at him with the eyes of a child starring hopefully at a knight in a princess story. Just hoping he'll be there.

He's so far from perfect. But no matter if he loves me or if he hurts me, I think I'll still choose him every time."
do,"So, this might be a bit of an unorthodox story of NoFap but I hope it can affect those who have trouble stopping.

I think it is best for me start from the beginning and why I became addicted to porn. After two relationships in which both I thought was true love but both ended really badly I was disheartened about meating girls. I didn't believe in love anymore and just resorted to porn. Now, this was a year ago since the last relationship and I've since then met girls that changed my mind. But the viscious porn circle kept me from making a move. I was sexually content and love without sex is just platonic. I was literally friendzoning girls because of porn (I.e. friendzoning myself).

I was aware of my porn problem. I really tried, several times, to stop. But when you have been fapping up to 9 times a day it is not easy to stop and I quickly rebounded. 

After last failed attempt I decided to just turn 180 degrees and fully embrace porn. In other words: to be a part of porn somehow. 

I started a porn blog on tumblr. And without any kind of advertising(people found my blog through tag searching) I quickly gained a huge following. Over 1000 followers in just a months time. And suddenly people started to write to me, thanking me for ""turning them on so much"" and ""having the best porn blog"". And I even received, and still receive, sexual offers from various kind of people (females, homosexuals, transexuals...) 

I was flattered of course, so I began sexting back. And through the sexting I totally lost the need to fap to porn. I somehow gained a new perspective on... what I wanted to do with my penis. 

The first few days were hard, literally. Especially because I still run the blog and some of the sexts have been quite intense. But I didn't cum and after a 2 days I stopped fapping altogheter. In the last few days I've started a dating profile and I have asked one of my platonic relationships straight out on a date... And she said yes :)"
do,"Today I've been able to help someone better understand Asexuality! 

I just started an account on okcupid and on my profile I included that I'm a heteroromantic asexual. Someone messaged me today who was surprised and intrigued about Asexuality. They said they are a nympho so it's hard for them to understand someone not really being that interested in sex. 

I've been explaining as much as I can to him and I hope that I'm making my fellow asexy people proud! I've tried to explain what Asexuality means and doesn't mean including topics of orgasms, masturbation, aromanticism, kinks, Asexuality being like its own spectrum  and everything else I can think of. I'm glad that someone is interested in learning about it and that I'm able to help spread awareness! :)"
do,"Hi everyone! 

I am pretty new to Doctor Who, I just started watching about 8 months ago (already on season 8, no spoilers, please!). 

I am looking for your favorite place to read DW lore.  Do you have favorite books? Website? Reddit posts? 

I would love to add some Who books to my collection or some bookmarks to my web browser."

do,"my ex and I broke up because he felt that our differences in religion would affect each other. one day, it just ended when we still loved one another so much. recently I got to know that a girl confessed to him right after we broke up and I feel so disgusted by the fact that someone was eyeing him when our relationship was rocky. All I ever did was to fight for it and it drained me out mentally and emotionally. Then all this time, someone was keeping an eye on her target. wow. just feeling so shitty right now."
do,"I met this girl, let's call her Jane, in a photography class at the beginning of the school year. I am extremely introverted. I'm really bad at starting a conversation with somebody I barely know, especially when I have a crush on that somebody. In a normal class, I could probably find a way to talk to her. This photography class doesn't really fit the bill of normal, though. It's really quiet, and everybody is focused on their computers until the end of class. Me and Jane sit at the same table, but my computer monitor blocks out most of her face, so there's really no eye to eye contact there. There is a few minutes at the end of class where we stand at the door. I figure that this is probably the best time to say something to her. How do I make genuine conversation out of the blue with a girl I barely know? I also desperately want to avoid looking creepy. 

TL;DR I have a crush on a girl I barely know, I am really quiet, how do I start a conversation without being creepy?"
do,"I am a lonely 23 year old female. That is a big part of why I am here. I am probably one of the most empathetic people in this world, yet I always feel like I am getting shunned or walked on. Would be lovely to meet some genuine kind people who won't make me feel alone. I am just looking for companionship (this is where the hopeful part plays in the title).  
I have tried so hard to maintain ""friendships"" but it is ALWAYS me putting in all the work (texting, calling, trying to make plans, making sure they're okay, etc) and I am so tired of everything feeling so one-sided. I just want someone to care about me and make me feel like a human being. Like I matter.  I never have anyone to talk to, and it makes me feel unimportant."
do,"TL;DR: I got diagnosed with depression, and I believe my birth control is the cause. I switched from Sprintec to Blisovi (norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol) Any ideas on the types I can try?

The long version with a lot of background:
I am a 20 year old female who has never had kids. I got diagnosed with clinical depression 1 month ago. It was suggested I go to a therapist. It has been a pain in the butt to find one that accepts my insurance, so I haven't gone yet. I have been depressed since beginning of February. Originally I thought it was because I was sick for 6 months constantly. Then I got better physically, but the depression was still very bad.  In the time it has been taking to find a therapist, I have been doing some serious self-evaluations with my mom, and we just could not figure out why I suddenly got really bad. Then my mom asks if it is my BC. I switched my BC in January because the one I was on previously wasn’t working to control my cramps and heavy flow due to the fact I was on antibiotics pretty much constantly. I realized my mood was always much more elevated when I am on my period, and taking the inactive pills. 
I went to my GYN today, and she suggested an IUD. She sent me home with a bunch of pamphlets on 3 different long term BC. I was also given a very low dose of a different combo pill to try. I am going to try the combo pill, but I am not too hopeful. On both pills I have tried, I had next to no libido.
Has anyone had a problem with depression being caused by BC? Were you able to find one that worked for you without causing depression? The copper IUD sounds great to me, but I also take BC to control very bad cramps and menorrhagia. I don’t think the copper IUD will help with that, will it? I am worried about taking any BC that involves hormones because they have really knocked me on my ass."
do,"So last night whilst under the influence I found myself in an Instagram hole. Clicking and clicking I found myself on a few profiles that I found very inspiring to my art and stuff. But I forgot to follow them. My question is, is there a way to view profiles I've recently looked at? Like a history of sorts? I know that if I had searched them it would show up in the search bar but I found them via random clicking. I've tried to go back through the tags I was in last night but no luck. I also didn't like any of their photos. Am I shit out of luck? Sorry if this post isn't in the correct spot, I don't Reddit often. Thanks!"
do,"In January, I was diagnosed with having a heterozengous mutation of the c677t gene (sorry if my verbiage is off). Following, we did a full look at my genetic makeup, and found that I have quite a few mutations. I have been seeing a nutritionist, who is helping me address these through diet and supplements. I have also stop eating gluten and foods fortified with folic acid (I already didn't eat dairy or soy). 

I feel very frustrated. I'm only 23 years old, but I feel trapped by this. I know I'm young, and it's a good thing that I know what's going on. I am greatful to have an answer to why I have been so sickly my entire life, but I though once I knew, I could be healthy and move forward with my life. But instead, everything is seems like such an effort, and there's no payoff. 


Backstory: This all started last November. Desipte having an IUD, I accidentally got pregnant (ob said because of hormonal issues, caused Mirena to not work properly). Growing up, i was almost always sick, plus migraines and anxiety and rashes and just feeling shitty and tired all the time. As a kid, I dreamed of having triplets, but by the time I was in middle school, I had convinced myself that I didn't want a family. I was not going to bring another person into this world who may have any or all of these things that I grew up with. But then when I got pregnant, for the first time, I had to really think about what a life with a baby would be like. And I completely fell in love with the idea. I would be a great mother. I was about to graduate with my masters, and I felt like despite this being a huge accident, it became a happy accident. But just three or four days after discovering I was pregnant, I started bleeding. In less than a week, this newfound fairytale was gone. After what happened, my ob told me it could have happened for a number of reasons. It was most likely, though, because I've been extremely malnourished for most of my life. I have always had severe iron deficiency anemia, despite never actually starting my period and eating a healthy diet. I have an deficient in vit's b and d, plus calcium. I also managed to trip while walking, and because of these deficiencies, what should have been a little sprain turned out to be a chipped bone, a torn tendon, and two ligaments that were so stretched they were no longer fuctioning. After these two strange medical incidents, I was referred by my ob and oncologist (who was addressing the iron) to see a nutritionist. Neither of them could figure out what was going on, despite numerous tests. My first appointment with the nutritionist and she knew right away. A few weeks later, tests confirmed the mutation and we starting supplementing. I was feeling better after just a few days.

In just a couple of months I went from not wanting kids to accidentally pregnant and in love with the idea of having a family to a miscarriage to finding out I'll probably never be able to have kids of my own. I know there are other ways to have a family, but as I said, I'm only 23. It's not something that I should have to be handling right now. 

Choices make us, but I didn't choose any of this. I get sometimes life isn't fair, but it's like I have nothing left. There is no joy in anything anymore. It's like my only purpose is to be sad. There have been so many times when I didn't react well. I know that, but how am I supposed to handle this all on my own? None of my friends understand what I'm going through, and I'm just pushing them all away. I have no one to talk with about this stuff. No one gets it. I'm exhausted of trying to hold it together. (I am seeing a therapist, but due to the ankle injury back in December, I had to have surgery and am at home recovering for a few weeks.) 

How have you all accepted all of this? How do I move forward? Everything seems like such an effort, between the restricted diet to the supplements to just having to be a lot more careful about my health in general. I want to be young and carefree. I want a family someday. I want to feel healthy and happy and free, but I'm stuck right now. I'm exhausted from trying to hold myself together just to get through the day."
do,My 15 year old tabby started exhibiting rather odd symptoms today. She cannot walk in a straight line and nearly falls over (it's like a drunken swagger). When she tries to jump onto/off of thing she misjudges the distance and falls. I called the vet and we have an appointment first thing in the morning but we are really scared for her. Does anyone know what might be wrong?
do,"Hi all! So over the weekend, I touched up my purple hair. I used Punky Color Violet in addition to my usual choice of Punky Color Plum, which was a mistake. The color came out to a dark-nearly-black indigo. I have a gala to attend in two weeks and I'm hoping to have my hair as least-indigo-looking, and most purple looking, as possible by then.

My first love was the written word, so i have lots of books."
do,"So, I don’t know where to post this honestly. I’m probably going to post it in few different places and it’s probably going to be rambling but I just needed to get it out. I’ve been trying to see a therapist for a while now about this but between my own failures and life just getting in the way I haven’t been able to yet. It’s been at least 6 months maybe longer that I’ve wanted to talk to someone about this and I was hoping it was going to be a professional but I at this point I just need someone. This is probably going to be long but I’m going to try to keep it concise so here goes.

First a little background about me. So, I just turned 21 and don’t got a lot going for me. Shit job that pays the bills, in college but doing terrible, not obese but defiantly fat, not really any good friends and terrible with girls as of the last few years. Like bad, like haven’t had a real conversation with a girl in forever much less sex or a real relationship. Now I don’t blame anyone but myself for all this, I kind of always blame myself. On top of all that I was diagnosed with depression years ago when my parent split. For a while I had it under control and life was good but as of recent it came back and hard. So, with that out of the way I’ll get into recently.

See the closest friend I’ve had for the last few years just happen to be my cousin. Without giving away too many reveling details she’s the best friend I’ve ever had and more then I deserve I think. I don’t really know how we got as close as we did. I mean yea were related but I didn’t see her much growing up. Anyways were close and more best friends then cousins. See we are super open about everything including sex like we’ve talked about who we’ve done it with and where and all that. One night we were talking about how she did it at the park we were at with an ex and in my brilliance thought fuck it. So, I asked her if she wanted to have sex. We were both kind of in the mood and she knew I had been going through a dry spell for a while now and we agreed that it was a onetime thing and that we wouldn’t talk about it. So we did and it was super casual for us both at first and not much changed. Later it ended up happening again though and we were both drunk so we wrote it off as a dumb mistake. Well just recently we went to a party together both looking to find someone to take home but neither of us found anyone. Later at her place again, were just lying in bed bullshiting and obviously both horney. We had already agreed not to do it again but eventually my dumbass asked if she wanted to mess around. We were both so turned on by then it wasn’t even a question that needed asking. We start fooling around again and she gets off but almost immediately after she started freaking out about it. I got up and just tried talking to her about it just making sure she was ok. I didn’t know it till after she calmed down but I was in shock about the whole thing and once I went in the bathroom and saw myself in the mirror I lost it and she had to sit there and talk to me like I had just done for her. We agreed that no matter how drunk we both got that it was better for both of us if we stopped this. We ended up sleeping in different beds that night just to make it less akward and the next morning I went to get her up and maybe talk about what had happened. We ended up just lying there and cuddled for an hour or so and it was honestly wonderful. Day goes by and we were tired as shit so we went to watch a movie then go to bed. As soon as we got in bed though she cuddled up next to me and it was right then that I realized that I had been lying to myself about the whole thing. See the next morning we both got up and realized what we had been doing. Both of us had been trying to fill a void that being having someone to love. We were both in love with the idea of love as we’ve both been single for a while now. I was defiantly the more attached one honestly and we both knew that. I even told her that if we weren’t related that I would date her and she said she wouldn’t. I don’t blame her for thinking that I’m far less attractive then her anyways. So we agreed to stop the cuddling and sex for good and go back to being best friends who could just hang out and have a good time. 

But see that’s the thing that I’ve been panicking about. I don’t know if we can go back to that. See the reason we got along so well before all this is because we could just hangout and have a great time no matter what. That’s exactly what she wanted for most of her life, just a great friend who didn’t want anything from her other than good company and I had to go fuck it all up because I was thinking with my dick. She’s my fucking cousin for fuck sakes and my best friend and I pushed her away cause I’m an idiot.

(tldr) After a super long dry spell I had sex with my best friend who happens to be my cousin and now I’m panicking about the whole thing because I’m afraid she thinks I’m just another guy who wants to use her. I just don’t want to lose my best friend and any advice on how to cope with this would be helpful."

do,"So, i'm 20. I’m a pretty happy, go lucky person, but whenever i think back to my childhood i instantly get depressed and cannot function. This has been haunting me for years, and i'd love to get it out in the open. But, i would like it if someone could read this and tell me, if i have legit reason to be upset about this, or if i'm overreacting?


So, in my first 6 years, i was a normal, happy kid. I had a warm, happy family. My parents were just normal, i was a little spoiled, but when your the first born, that's kind of a given, right?


But that all changed when i was 5, my mom announced she was pregnant. with another baby. At first, i was happy, i knew what was happening, since i saw it on tv before. Mom still had time for me, of course that all changed when i was 6. I was in 1st grade when she was born. Until she was born, my parents spent literally all their time with me.


Here is when the bs started.
.

So, to start was her actual birth itself. It was a saturday, mom went into labor. I was in my bedroom, playing a video game. Then, during the middle of my game, i heard tires squealing, i looked out my window and saw the family car speeding off. They forgot me, i at first thought they were rushing to the corner store, since mom had some bizarre cravings, mostly for their pizza. But hours went by, i started to worry, and after almost 6 HOURS, someone came to the house to get me (my grandmother). I was kind of peeved, but my dad promised to get me ice cream, so all was settled.



So, next was the sleeping arrangement. Every night, i slept right between my parents. I never slept alone, they tried to ween me, but i wasn't particularly fond of my bed. I liked sleeping with them, because it was warm, and i've always had this ""thing"", where i have to run my fingers through someone's hair before sleeping, i kind of grew out of it, forcefully. 


How? Well, i never got to share a bed with mom again, me and my dad were regulated to the guest room. Mostly because i didn't sleep alone (i never started until i was about 12). Every night after that, my mom took my sister into my spot, she said she'd come get me to come in her bed after my sister fell asleep, but guess what? She never did. Not once did i sleep with mom ever again.


We later moved in with my grandma, who only had 2 rooms. I slept with mom and sis every night, and she always pryed and forced herself between me and mom.


Come to think of it, mom never really had time for me any more, i had to start taking the bus to school. since she had no babysitter, plus dad worked.


I kind of always prefered mom, to my dad. She was a lot more fun, and creative. She made me a marble box out of popsicle sticks once. But, she kind of pawned me off on my dad after the devil child was born.


Sadly, when i was 7, my parents divorced and me, my sister, and my mom lived with my grandma.



Now, when i was 9, i had gotten involved in 4-h. I had a talent for writing and giving speeches. So, it was  a big deal for me. I was the best in my class, and even made it to county competition. One of only 5 kids in my school. It was my proudest moment, since i always sucked at sports.


So, we got to the place, there were 50 people listening to me give my speech, i had my little suit, and was very proud of myself. I practiced hours a day, i wanted to go to state as well. And as soon as i get to the podium, guess who starts crying. Loud enough that everyone can hear it. My sister. So, mom had to take her out. She never saw my speech. I gave it, but i just couldn't do it right, i was on the verge of crying myself from what happened. I was too upset that she was missing it, i got a ""Participant"" ribbon, my big moment was ruined. I was gonna do it again next year, but when i wrote my speech, i had no enthusiasm for the project, and it lacked the ""zing"" the previous one had, so i didn't advance very far. I honestly didn't care anymore, mom asked about it, I told her my sister would probably ruin it.


She started growing up, and became an even more entitled little tyrant. Here we start on her as a tween. She just got so much worse.


First of all, mom really only paid attention to her. She never came in my room to come visit, at all. That's a general example, here is a more specific list.


First of all, there was one time that my pants had a hole, the pocket ripped and my wallet fell out, and I never noticed until the next day. She found it, and instead of returning it, she took $100 out of it, then returned it the next day. Worst of all, she told mom to promise not to tell me that she took it, she bought a cell phone with it. I didn't even find out until almost 10 years later.


Anytime I would try to spend time with mom, she'd always come in. I never got alone time with my mom, without her rearing her head. That was if I even got to spend time with her at all. She'd promise to spend time with me, but I’d either wait forever, and I’d be too tired to do anything. Or, she'd never show up at all.


One time, it was about 8, I asked if she wanted to play Tetris. She said she'd love to, in a few minutes. So, I loaded up Tetris, paused it and waited. Keep in mind, I couldn't really do anything else. It was nearly 2 and a half hours. She never showed, so I went to bed, I could hardly hold my eyes open. She finally did show, she got mad and said ""I thought you wanted to play?"" But, I told her ""I couldn't wait forever.""


Her excuse was that she had to wait for my sister to go to bed, because I’d get mad if she came to play too. Instead of saying ""No, I want some quality time with my son"", she just waited till absurd hours of the night, knowing I’d be too tired to play.


That was how it was any time I wanted to play with mom.


Minor story, I got a bop it toy for Christmas. She asked to borrow it and take it to school, she had to write her name on it so if it got lost, the school would know who it belonged too. She never gave it back, and about 2 weeks, her and mom were playing with it, I asked if I could have it back, and she said it was hers. I never saw it again.


One time, she broke my tv. She got the day off from school, faking being sick (I’ll get to that in a moment). While at school, she lounged around my room all day, and somehow broke my tv. I have no clue how, but it's just when I got home it was broken. She never got yelled at or punished whatsoever.


The time I got the flu. All night I had been chilled, shivering, and sick. I felt awful, I told my grandma, and she let me take the day off and would take to the doctor's office that day.


That morning, I got yelled at, accused for playing hooky. I got took to the doctor, and guess what? I was diagnosed with the flu. Mom changed her tone, and acted nice and as if she was worried the whole time. I got guilted for needing to miss a week. Then the next day, guess who got the flu? My sister.


So, she got tested. Guess what, no flu. She acted sick all morning, but as soon as mom told her she could miss school, 2 hours later, she was riding her bike and doing cart wheels in the yard. No yelling, no punishment


One time she threw my 80's, rare wrestling figures into a muddy ditch, ruining the paint job. Nothing.


There was one birthday, she got $100, my birthday came, only 75.


You know, around this time I started to watch lots of anime. I pretended I was in their worlds, it always brought me happiness. I tried to get my mom interested, but she never did. Then, one weekend, I asked her to play Mario with me, like the good old days. But, my sister showed up, with a Dragon Ball Z DVD, battle of gods movie. She asked if I wanted to watch it, I said no because I’ve seen that movie 10 times already. Mom got mad at me, and watched it with her. For 5 years I’ve been begging her to watch it with me, but she never could. I sat and watched it with them, because she said if I did, she'd play with me. She sat through the whole movie with her. So, after waiting over an hour for her to play with me. She finally showed, played one level, and went to bed because she was too tired. We'd play in the morning she said, that morning never came.


Then, my graduation. Around this time, she moved in with our dad. They all came to my graduation, but she mostly talked to her the whole time, begging her to come visit.


Also, funnily enough, I never got told congratulations or anything for graduation. She never posted how proud she was of me on Facebook, or anything. But, that same year, my sister made the honor roll. I never heard the end of it.


So, recently, last year I got an injury.  and that brought on a whole slew of crap.


Most of these involve me wanting privacy for my problems and her showing up when not wanted.


First, was physical therapy. She just had to come, without even asking me, mom said yes. I told her no, I didn't want her to go. We had a huge fight, and we didn't go.


Then, was a checkup. I didn't want her to come, but she did anyway. There was no reason for her to go, they just sat in the lobby. This was a very personal thing, and I wanted as few people there as possible.


I remember mom wheeled me in, (I was in a wheelchair), and sis said she'd wait in our car. Nope, guess who walked in. Mom largely ignored me at my own appointment. Therapy and Doctor's appointments were the only time we really got together.


Then, another time I asked her to play a game with me. She actually did, then in 5 minutes, guess who called out. My sister, mom just disappeared, and never came back, so I just turned it off.


And finally, the most recent example. I actually planned on moving out. I needed a 10-dollar box. I begged and asked for weeks, and it took seemingly forever to buy me that box, but my sister asked for a 300-dollar dress, and she got it bought for her in less than a day."
do,"I started showing signes of major depression in 2015, and was officially diagnosed 3 months ago. 

Long story short, now I was the failure who couldn’t bother getting up, the bad daughter who wasn’t even grateful to my parents for raising me. They yelled at me every day, denying me treatment and denying my condition in general. I was the self-absorbed, egoistical, ungrateful, useless git because I had suicidal thoughts and couldn’t even get out of bed or eat on most days. They believed that depression was my excuse to live on their money - like I didn’t desperately want to move out. They believed that I was making their lives miserable on purpose.

On one of the bad days I mentioned to them that if I was such an economic burden (I wasn’t even recieving treatment because my mum thought that depression was a non-issue that existed only in your head, and that I was simply too lazy to “snap out of it”) I would just move out. I could go to my friends’ and boyfriend’s place to camp out for a bit until I’ve found a job.

And then my parents are like... no-one loves you as much as we do, if you go out there no-one will be good to you, you’ll just come crawling back. We’ve spent so much money on you, and in return you have the audacity to be so ungrateful and selfish to even suggest this... is that how you repay us? etc etc.

Then I’m overwhelmed with guilt. My parents aren’t so bad as most N parents I’ve read here, but they make my depression worse with their self-justified, “I know you better than you know yourself”, holier-than-thou attitude. I need to save myself, but will I really be such a terrible person if I go NC? Would I be selfish to go NC, after all my parents have done (and tried to do) for me? Even though their actions have horrible consequences on my mental health (and even though they pretty much justify themselves in doing so), don’t their well-meaning intentions count?

I know almost everyone here is pro-NC, but what I really want to ask is this: how do you know you’re doing the right thing? How can I know I’m not the one being selfish and ungrateful? Or am I really selfish and ungrateful for thinking this, when my parents are so obviously better than most N parents out there? Am I just taking everything for granted?"
do,I've realized I have a lot of internalized homophobia and hate myself for being gay but trying to come to terms with it.

do,"I remember when I was in high school, there was a series of books I read. I can't remember if it's Fantasy or Romantic Fantasy (I vaguely remember mature scenes, but nothing explicit). I cannot remember the author, but here are the details I remember:

* Main character lost his hand and has a jeweled gauntlet
* MC lost his eye and has a patch over it, he is cursed (I can't remember if there was a prosthetic eye or not)
* The character, whenever he killed any enemies, could ""summon"" them via his cursed eye
* The series is ""Lord of..."", ""Queen of..."", ""King of..."" or something along those lines
* It was possibly written in the 80s to 90s (I was reading it in... '06-07, but the cover was older)
* I remember the cover of the ""Queen"" one being a man on a rearing horse with a sword, holding a naked female

If anyone could possibly find this series, or even remember the name of it or the author, that would be fantastic. I've been wracking my brain trying to remember because I want to reread the series."

do,"I completed 401 at UCB, and was not admitted to advanced study. My day job is on Long Island so it's hard to do weeknight practices/performances.

I feel like I'm at the point where those that want to do improv for life take 401 and the 410s a few times until they get admitted to advanced study and those that like improv but have serious day jobs hit a bump. I took 412 as well and did not make advanced study. 

So at this point, what do people who want to do improv as a hobby do? I think since my last 401 class was in Summer 2014 I can't even take 401 again. I would not be willing to start at 101 again at UCB.

- Since I'm also interested in sketch, should I try to take Sketch 101 at UCB?
- Should I consider taking classes at other schools like magnet or PIT?
- Should I look to join indie teams in Queens, where I live, or possibly Long Island, where I work, so I can do weekday participation?
- Is my improv run over?"
do,"Me (M/17) and my girl friend (F/!7) have been going out over the past 8 months or so, and today her parents found out that we were dating and have grounded her and i have no way to talk to her. I have no idea what to do. should i go to her parents and talk to them or wait it out, or some other idea. I could use some advice.

Back ground:
Me and her were best friends for 12 months prior to this relationship. Her step-dad was a 5 year Marine, her mom has had multiple partners she as 2 half siblings and one step sister. BOth of her parents work jobs were they have to travel out of town all day. So, when we first started dating i new the risks and the problem that she was not aloud to date but i chose to go through with it anyways. Over the next two months i would see her at school help her with her grades, and talk to her and help her with her friends. At four months she got scared one day that her parents would find out and take her away from me she, got severely depressed and decided she was going to kill herself. No one was going to do anything so i stepped up rised it all and reported her to the school consolers. They alerted her parents and she told them it was me who reported her. Though durning this time they knew me and her had been talking and they blamed me and believed i was a ""bad guy"". Over the past month i would hang out with her at her house or take her out and get her lunch or go to the park, when she broke her foot i went to her house and helped her out with her chores. I also at times would make her a nice lunch and bring it to her. A wek ago she went on a cruise and then today she got back, and apparently her parents found out and she told me to stay away from her, do not go to her house, or call her.

I’m a high school senior who’s currently enrolled in calculus and while I get the process of calculus it seems that my foundations in earlier mathematics are rocky at best. I currently have a C in calculus which is laughable to most of you I’m sure, and I’m also sure I’ll get some hate because of that. I’ve had a lot of rough times in high school to where I haven’t necessarily been the best math student simply because early on it was extremely easy to me but I lost interest in it somewhere along the lines due to more pressing matters in my mental health. Now though that I’m, to my standards, failing calculus I’m desperate to rebuild my mathematics foundations for higher learning in the future and to improve. I know all of you math gods out there would be much better at helping me than the millions of links I could follow through google.

P.S over the summer I found a deep interest and love for mathematics and physics which increased my desire to do everything in my power to improve."
do,"I had a really rough night last night. I couldn't sleep. My girlfriend was on FaceTime with me all night to help me and calm me down. At about 5 in the morning I got my duvet from upstairs, brought it down and lay it on the sofa. I didn't expect to sleep but I did, whilst still on FaceTime.
I was very sleepy but still a little bit awake and I could hear another voice. My girlfriend had gone out to find Pokèmon for a while but remained on FaceTime. The voice was male and Irish. I wasn't panicked even though usually I would be incredibly paranoid. It's probably because I was half asleep. The conversation didn't last long until I heard the voice say ""Give us a kiss, then"" and my eyes immediately opened and I began to hyperventelate. She said ""I don't really know you, sorry"". I was relieved instantly and a minute after I asked her who it was and why they said that. She looked stiff and shaky and she began to cry. She told me that I deserved better than her and admitted that she kissed him. There were no tongues involved and the kiss was about a second long. She told me she only did it to get him away. I believe her as she was really, really shooken up.
However - I am the only person she has ever kissed until today. That really, really bothers me. I have kissed her since this happened, too. It really bothers me.
What should I do? She has promised me nothing like this will happen again and she has repetitively called herself stupid. She is friendly with people more than I would like her to be and I think she realises that now. She is very paranoid about upsetting people and wants to be kind and nice to everyone and give everyone what they want. She has vowed to never do it again and to be more ""loyal"" towards me.
Any advice? Has she cheated on me?"

Hope everyone is well. 

So continuing on my journey I'm basically completely unmedicated for SLE at the moment..  
&gt;TLDR: don't tolerate plaquenil well (ibs kills me) and prednisone makes me an insomniac then does the reverse because not sleeping makes me die.
&gt;&gt;on naproxen (to be able to stand) and it gives me reflux... Heartburn.... Anyone else have this?? 

Any way back to the point... Apart from normal lupus stuff like pain etc. I've been experiencing increasing skin issues as I go along unmedicated... Basically my skin feels raw? Anyone else have this?? I live in Australia and we've just hit 40 degree days (104F) as its just become summer and I am starting to struggle... 

&gt; New symptoms: my hair started falling out because my hair follicles kept getting infected or turning into huge boil pimple things and my Scalp is so itchy/dry/irritated... Started using less chemicals, vegan lush shampoo and a moisturising conditioner and my hair has improved but the heat has made it regress a little. Any recommendations on hair care? 
&gt;&gt;I get sunburnt through the window driving in my car I am that photosensitive now... I use sunblock but it stuffs up my skin (never liked it) and i only got mildly sunburnt but my body acted as if I had sun stroke?? I had to go to the pharmacy and inhale electrolytes because I got a bad fever and was super dehydrated... 
&gt;&gt;&gt;my skin is so unbearably itchy all the time I legit will accidentally scratch it raw because it's so uncomfortable.. Especially on my back. Anyone have any natural remedies? I like cannot put any chemicals or anything on it and I avoid showering for long periods because it's so uncomfortable :(
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;last but not least I am SO THIRSTY ALL THE TIME. LIKE ridiculously like I can drink two litres of water in under  a minute thirsty.... Like if I don't drink I get migraines or feel really disgusting and with this hot weather I'm having to consume so much liquid.... Anyone else have any similar issues? 
I find if I consume drinks with sugar or lots of salt it also helps me retain water... 

Would love some natural ideas because I just got bitten by mozzies and I'm going to rip my normally itchy skin off...."

Book name: ????
Series name: ????
Author: ???? (Assumed to be male)
Cover description: purple, with a lady wearing black stood with two wolves either side of her in front of a city view. 
Page number: 200-300 pages
*THIS BOOK IS ASSUMED TO BE PART WAY TO HALF WAY THROUGH THE SERIES?*

Plot points:
•The main girl is trapped in another dimension with her dog. 

•When she watches her favourite supernatural DVD, a character speaks to her through it and tells her that the DVD is the only way they can contact her from her original dimension. 

•She has to piece together her other life whilst the world she is currently in is slowly ending. 

•She works at a small trailer cafe, since her boss (who was foreign, Japanese or Chinese) is one of the first to die. 

•She lost her job at this cafe and she was trying to convince him to get her job back

•I also think vampire beings came when the world started to end?

•She had a flashback of her other world where everyone was dancing and then she saw her husband. He was short and I think fat, and had a walking stick? He could have been a mythical creature or a Dwarf?

•Her dog turns out to be her husband from her other dimension, having taken on a new body just as she has. 

•At the end of the book, she has a battle with a monster and is left telling her friends that she is ""going back"" to the other world. 

• Close to the end, a man comes to her house to try and kill her, and her dog saves her by sacrificing himself - he threw himself at him and he got in the way of what I think was a bullet shot?

do,"I just bought a mech and I have a few Samsung 30Q’s that I plan to run in it. 

I know about Ohm’s Law and calculating everything, but my question lies with safe firing times. 

The build I would really like to run is a dual staggered fused Clapton (2x 26g Kanthal cores, 32g Nichrome Shell, 4 wraps, 3mm ID) in my Dead Rabbit RDA. Currently, they come out to 0.14 ohms.

The problem is that a 0.14 ohm build draws around 25 amps, which is 10 amps higher than the safe continuous discharge range for the Samsung 30Q’s. 

Would this still be safe, so long as I’m not just holding down the fire button? Or should I just go ahead and increase the resistance by increasing the number of wraps/ID of the coil?

Alternatively, I do have some LG Chem HG2’s that I can use, which have a safe continuous discharge rating of 20 amps. Would those be a safer bet?"

do,"**TL;DR - If you have time to quit video games, you can read my damn post.**

I don't want to think of myself as an addict. And sure, there's the cliche'd ""no one does"", but really. I don't want to think of myself as an addict. I did my GCSEs this year (I'm 16) and came out almost top of the class in everything. I never needed to study. I never bothered with getting a good night's sleep and I never worried about flunking an exam. I could play video games from dawn until dusk and still do better than 95% of the class. It made me feel powerful, even though I never voiced it, to know that no matter what I did with my spare time, I'd perform better than anyone else in school.

However, this isn't a brag. What I'd give for it to be a brag.

I started sixth form about 6 weeks ago and I have never been more out of my element. I make jokes about it in class but I actually have to *work*. I don't know how. I spent so long playing Overwatch and League of Legends that I lulled into a sense of complacency. *I'll be fine in sixth form. People say it's hard but I'm the exception.* Whenever I talked to someone about it, this is what I'd secretly tell myself. I thought I was in control.

Initially I picked Maths, Further Maths, English and Law. People were revering me for picking 4 A levels. I'm not too knowledgeable in American education so I'm not sure how to put it in a more understandable way, but it's the student equivalent of trying to climb Everest without a harness, I suppose. The amount of A levels people usually do is only 3. That fourth one doesn't sound like much, but it's basically social suicide for a student. Imagine how in depth a subject would be if you chose nothing but that and two others to study for two years. Adding a fourth to the mix usually isn't recommended. 

I didn't care though - I was invincible. The rules of mortals didn't apply to me. I could pass everything and do it with flying colours. 

I spent £1200 building a gaming PC in August. You can check my post history if you want. Before this, I had an everyday 4GB ram laptop that could only run LoL decently and Overwatch, albeit at minimum settings at 30fps. It looked like minecraft. Now that I could play more games, I did. I bought Rocket League. CSGO. I redownloaded Warframe. Heroes of the Storm. So many titles that I had to get rid of because they wouldn't run acceptably on my laptop. Now? Daddy was home. I spent every waking hour of the day playing video games. I can max out anything I throw at my PC and it'd happily indulge me in sweet sweet gaming glory. At the start of the month I even took a few ""sick days"" off to spend playing games I had recently downloaded. My mother caught on, but because of an incident that had occurred early in September regarding my mental health my mother has been lenient. Either way, it's all been crashing down. It started with me dropping Law. I didn't understand anything in either of the Maths classes. I had one of the highest grades in my exams earlier this year, and I couldn't understand anything. Compared to my classmates, new and old, I was a dunce. I dropped Further Maths, and changed it for Psychology. I ended up dropping Maths a week and a half ago for Philosophy and Ethics. Numbers don't make sense to me anymore. Brain fog clouds my thought whenever I have to complete exam questions or homework. I get frustrated and take my mind off it by playing Overwatch for an hour. Or two. Or five. I spend my time at school copying homework from ""friends"" so that I don't get kicked out of classes.

Then again, what friends? The pull of video games and faux achievement and the pushing of my anxieties to keep me inside means I have no social life whatsoever. I went paintballing with a few people on Saturday, but only because our tickets expired this week and I was forced to invite people by my mother. There was a party the night before, that I ""couldn't attend"". It's not like anyone asked or will care. If it does come up, that'll be my excuse. I feel alienated, so I stay inside. I stay inside, I become more alienated. Where can I break this cycle? I don't even know anymore.

Reading back through this, I'm not even sure if it's coherent. It feels garbled, and rushed and stupid and lame. I don't really feel lucid anymore. It feels like I'm watching someone else type with my fingers, or that I'm living in someone else's body and I'm watching an empty husk. I was diagnosed with severe depression accompanied by hallucinations a month ago. It could be that. I forget how to spell words a lot. At first I made excuses like, ""the next word I was about to write starts with that letter, that's why I wrote spelt this word wrong"", now it's just my clear stupidity hindering me. I would spell ""peel"" as ""peal"", ""sheriff"" as ""sherrif"" and so on. It feels like my mind is trying to wade through thick sludge. And yet, you bet your ass I can recite every single item in League of Legends. Or remember all of the hero abilities in Overwatch. My mind simply refuses to function when it comes to anything academic, and I know it's my addiction that's causing it. I'm filling my memory with stupid digital nonsense and forgetting anything that has genuine relevance. Sometimes I'll sit for a minute, a literal minute, and remember what it was I was going to do next, as I've completely forgotten. 

It's been an hour since I started writing this. I'm trying to put everything in words but I can't even do that properly. I feel like a completely different person - consumed by my depression and addiction to video games. I let video games define who I am. I was meant to do psychology homework today. 5 hours ago I said ""I'd do it in the evening"". It was only earlier, when I heard myself say, ""I'll do it tomorrow"", that I realised I need to stop. I need to stop playing so many video games and start reading again. God, I loved reading. I've taken out Captain Corelli's Mandolin from the library 3 weeks ago and managed 5 pages. I was meant to read The Great Gatsby for my English course. I haven't finished it. I was also meant to read Othello. Haven't finished it. I joined two subjects late and haven't read the catch-up material I was given, even though I had to beg to join the courses. I used to write too. I participated in NaNoWriMo two years ago. I did alright, but I couldn't keep up with the workload after two weeks. I was only 14, but even reading the cringe material I churned out back then I think, *how can I have written this?* I'm not the same, academic person I was. I'm a husk of who I am. My mother told me the same thing a few months ago and I got offended because she said it, but I realise now that she was right. I'm being consumed, inside out, by my habit of procrastination and video games. But you know what?

Fuck you Overwatch. I DON'T NEED A SKILL RATING TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF.

Fuck you League of Legends. I put up with toxic shit, and have seen myself become more toxic, and for what? FOR VICTORIOUS FUCKING MAOKAI? No thanks Riot.

Fuck you Town of Salem. I always die on the first night. *Always*. Holy SHIT, I mean *really*? Fuck that.

It's time for me to take back my life, and the way I treat it. I bought the Witcher 3 today. I'm going to return it. I'm not going to buy it until I can trust myself to play video games responsibly. I'm going to catch up with my studies. I'm going to buy a graphics tablet and finally pursue my dream of being a better artist. I'm going to become a better writer. I'm going to do it all and I'm going to do it fucking *well*, and you know why?

Because if I can surmount this obstacle, then I can take on anything.

I'd prefer not to do the second option. I'm way too shy for my own good, so I have issues asking my hair stylist what to do.

do,"Hey there, this is my first time posting. I realize that the question I am asking is rather abstract, but I appreciate any thoughts or advice you can offer.

To start off, I will admit that there is a mental illness in play here. I have a history of depression and anxiety. It is possible that the mental illness is the problem, but it might also be a symptom of something else. I don't mind you including mental illness advice in your comments, but I also don't want to assume that it is my issue.

I am 22 years old, recently finished college and moved out of my parent's house. I know live my several friends of mine in a house. I started a full-time job in my field a few weeks ago and I hope that it ends up being a really good place for me. I have friends, and enough of them. I have been trying to consolidate my friendships because some of them aren't really quality friends, but overall I feel good about my friends. I have a solid and supportive family, but they live in a different state. I have housemates, and they are good as well.

In theory I have everything that I need in life. Family, friends, a job, and a place to live. The house is nice, and I am about to get a better room. Also, my family is visiting this week and I have been spending time with them.

Even with all of this (and I will provide more detail about any of it if asked), I just feel empty. I feel especially empty when I am alone. I have found myself being rather clingy with my friends and housemates, and I can tell they are a little annoyed. 

I'd appreciate any advice you can give.

Thanks,

She's incredible immature and I don't like who he is around her. I've started bringing it up and I can tell he's really offended by it. I don't want to say it's her or me, they've been friends for so long. I just hate that they're going to college together and he can't say no to anything she tells him to do. I love him so much, I just hate feeling uncomfortable in my relationship.

What exactly can I say to him to make him understand what I'm feeling?"
do,"Recently got diagnosed with depression and elements of PTSD (long story) and to make matters worse, the weed also stopped making me feel good. The kicker is now I'm scared I may have developed a more serious mental illness from smoking also and it's really fucking stressed me out. I started to get racing thoughts, lack of motivation and enjoyment of things I used to like, lack of concentration and a loop of negative thoughts and really fucking insecure and kinda feeling like I'm not myself anymore (due to the aforementioned symptoms). The reason I'm distraught is because the weed only makes me focus on my problems and doesn't help me solve them and gives me panic attacks now. Is it possible for the weed to feel back to normal once I get over this depression ? Cause the lack of it is only making things harder lol."

do,"Hello,

How do I find a therapist that I can talk to that I can be honest with in regards to Near Term Human Extinction?  

I'm constantly angry and bitter, constantly have sucidial and homicidal thoughts.  Before you report me, I know acting on them is ""stupid"" and ""wrong"" since on a long enough timeline, everyone's survival rate is 0 and /r/collapse confirms it.  I have a dependent family that really doesn't need me to be this way.  I can't run the risk of being in a mental hospital if I reveal all this and they decide I'm a danger to my family where I will spend my last pre-collapse days.

What's so hard is that I KNOW I'm wrong but I FEEL like I don't have enough time to get my emotions in line with my knowledge. 

I'll try to keep my background on this brief.

* I'm 37 with a family and two kids.  Discovered /r/collapse 3 years ago.  Was in a bad place before that but I at least enjoyed some things.  Now I feel like a soulless zombie and I need help.

* I've got ADHD and severe chronic depression even before /r/collapse awareness.  I have zero self-worth.  I'm hyper aware of all my faults to the point I can't enjoy anything with anyone anymore.  Doing things on my bucket list felt numb and pointless (maybe because the things on there felt so superficial) so I stopped having any real goals except wait for collapse.

* I believe that it will only take a few weeks or months once a blue Arctic even occurs before collapse follows, which looks like its either this summer or next summer.  I realize that's not ""the end"" but it cuts off getting professional emotional help that I really need right now.

* I been nihilistic my whole life for different reasons before collapse, but I didn't realize until recently that I'm taking out my anger and resentment subconciously on my kids and wife in stupid little ways like a bully.  That's no way for them to live their last years, either.  

* As a final note, the survival books I've read said that you have to have a will to live if you are to survive any life-and-death hardship, and I barely have that will now, in the best of times.  I need to figure out how to get there in case I'm wrong about how bad collapse will be (and maybe everything else?  I don't know.)

Help!"

do,"I've been a very active dreamer for years.  My dreams are always colourful, lively and last for what feels like hours. I do not have scary dreams because even when I'm dreaming about things that are triggers of anxiety, 90 per cent of the time I know I'm dreaming; and I'm able to let the dreams carry on without alarm.  The only time I have dreams that are concerning are when they involve my emotions because they usually mirror my waking life; and even then, I know I'm dreaming, so I let it slide and just enjoy what my mind is presenting to me.

I don't always control my dreams directly, mainly because I'm a fan of just letting the dream come as it will; although on a few occasions I have prevented myself from waking up during stressful situations to allow to let the dream keep going.  

I also make it a point to sleep with some kind of noise in the background, mainly because I have difficulty going to sleep without it, but I love how the background noise filters into my dreams and makes far more facinating than they normally would be without additional aid.  This also has proven to be helpful in a very important area of my waking life - I am a journalism student and I always sleep to talk radio or news channels on television, which leads to perfect news quizes.  :p

TL;DR: I'm not sure if how I dream is lucid dreaming or if it's my own brand of awesome dreaming.  Help!"
do,"I've been recently talking to a guy and we've hung out a few times, nothing romantic. While expressing our likes and dislikes, he mentioned a few times how he always goes out of his way to be super courteous to the women he's dated but they either never appreciated it or were offended. At first I was enthralled that he was going to be a gentlemen - because I'm quite used to dating guys my age, which tend to be complete jerks (he's older). However, for some reason I'm beginning to think that he actually isn't a nice guy but someone that thinks just because he's nice to me, he's entitled to having things progress faster than I attend them to. I barely know him, and every time I open up with my own personal experiences he agrees that he's the same but he never expresses himself further. We both agreed that we were going to take things as they were, which to me, are the beginning stages of getting to know someone - not full on dating yet. Last week I had to cancel plans with him because I wanted to take a personal day off and ever since he's been cold and short with me. I get the feeling he wants to takes things further but as a result he's actually pushing me further away."

My eating has been very all over the place. My breakfasts have been pretty much perfect since I started. I'm pleased I could stick with the eggs and toast for this whole time minus one day where I went for donuts with my little brother. My lunches have ranged from extremely healthy to really bad. I haven't been very good but I'm trying meal prepping this week and it's gone pretty well. My dinners are almost always not great. I'm dealing with what my dad cooks and he's not a fan of a lot of the stuff I need to eat. I know people will say to just cook my own stuff but it's a complicated situation that I don't want to reveal on here. The biggest factor of my inability to be consistent is I was finally diagnosed with depression and everything finally made sense on why I feel like I do. My doctor suggested keeping a journal so at the end of everyday I jot down all the foods and snacking, my full workout that I actually accomplished (also writing down the pounds I lifted) and then 3 good things. I don't usually have a full 3 but it feels good to list stuff that I did well that day even if it's just one thing. I hope this update is sufficient.

My counselor has thought I may have ocd, although he never diagnosed me, even though my focus of anxiety and depression  is my relationship. I used to have panic attacks, vomit from anxiety, and cry from over analyzing my relationship. My brain would tell me ""you have to break up"" ""he's not right for you"" ""you don't find him attractive"" ""you should want to be with him all the time and always feel love"".  These thought among many others have continously cycled over the last two months. The panic attacks have stopped, I can see my boyfriend and feel happy, but the feeling of love still hasn't returned. I still have thoughts of ""oh you don't love him, you should break up"" but i don't panic as much. I was placed on 25mg of zoloft and 15 of buspar.

do,"My boyfriend and I have been together for.. almost 3 years now. It is a long distance relationship. We have seen each other quite a few times and such. Im suppose to move at lease end to his place. Big steps. But in the meantime, there is only so much we can do together. Luckily, we are both gamers. We game together as much as we can. 

The problem is, he does not have a day time job (he does not have to do his business) so he spends all day playing these games and getting to be a pro. I, on the other hand, work full time. Some times when I home I'd rather watch Netflix or Youtube or just sleep. I am exhausted and stressed about money, not a thing that he has to deal with. His life is very relaxing actually. There are times he doesn't understand my stress and gets frustrated when I don't want to play games with him. Most days, though, I get off work and automatically hop on Steam and message him, and we are into a game... and I enjoy it. I enjoy our time together and playing. 

But he makes it to where it is not enjoyable for me. He gets very aggressive. I am more casual. To be honest, I love games, but I am very slow at learning them and getting the mechanics. He gets very frustrated with me. It is a constant, ""What the f*** are you doing??? Learn to play the game!"" Further, he constantly tells me how terrible I am. Eventually, he gets frustrated. 

He doesnt seem to understand that, unlike him, I dont have all day every day to become master of all games (as he tends to get VERY good at every game he plays). It is the one thing we can do together, regularly, and he is ruining it for me by just.. being a salty gamer. 

I've tried to talk to him before about it and he just kind of pushed it off. Says he is trying to help me and that he does get upset when I am making them lose over and over. Yelling at me just makes me mad. I'm not good. I get that.

It seems stupid, but its getting frustrating. It is ruining the experience for me. I just like playing games. Always have. But it makes me stop caring or not want to take part in the one thing we get to do to spend time.

Going to have to stop my nursing course (I had 2 months left, I'm gutted!), was meant to be going to India next month to nurse out there which is also not happening. I have all these questions and thoughts in my head and Reddit has helped me in the past so I'm gonna give it a go.

1) As a girl who has always had long hair I'm so upset that chemo will probably make it fall out (it's sounds stupid I know)

2) Do younger people tend to die from cancer or recover (obviously a very open question but I'm freaking out)

3) got to start chemo and have an operation, I haven't told my mum any of this and I don't know how to even approach it because she suffers from severe depression and I'm worried this will tip her over the each.

do,"So I'm in hospital as I type this, I'll also update this at the end of the day if everyone wishes and post pictures of me in hospital now and my Doggy McDog face.


Bit of backstory, I'm 23 &amp; when I went through my AS exams I suffered from a 'mini stroke' WHOEVER NAMED IT THAT SHOULD BE SHOT. It took 3 months to walk unaided and a good year to get full strength to my left side, but when you're young, you're made of jelly, rubber bands and fairy dust so you kinda bounce back. The stroke they said was most likely caused by a mass overdose a doctor prescribed for pain. 


So 5/6 years later here I am, relitivly fit, about to walk McDog face. She ALWAYS has other plans (9months German Shepard) she walks behind me or yanks in front and also would always prefer to be at home. So we go on our 5km walk with little to no hiccups. At about the last 1-2km coming back home, all of a sudden I felt the lead go limp. I turn. All I see is her dog harness. Next thing I know the she-hulk darts past me, instinct kicks in and so I run. I'm not unfit, I try to do 50-60km a week jogging/walking as I want to be a police officer. But I'd been off gym with a virus I still had and was not prepared. After about 600m and yelling (I'm very loud as I used to act on stage so my voice carries, nobody, NOBODY helped) I'm starting to feel funny, seeing colours, feeling dizzy. I keep going after her as she darts off the main road (missed a car) and headed home. Just as she's about to run into the back garden (left the gate open) she saw a cat... Gave up and got family to get her. Meanwhile I'm in a slump struggling to recover. After I thought I had recovered I went in to give her a big telling off. I'm shouting, and she's starting to accept it and go into the kitchen. Meanwhile my sister who has slight learning difficulties is bringing this around to her. She's rocking on a chair and yelling so I argue at her, give up and go shut me and dog face in the kitchen. 

As I'm getting a drink I feel dizzy and get colours in my vision, long to short I collapse. When I recover I can't breath, as I'm struggling it's starting to hurt. When I get free, I realise I can't feel my arms or legs or talk... Again. I'm now in the hospital currently having blood tests, they're making sure this isn't a second stroke. I'm not tremoring any more and can now coordinate better, before I'd been asked to reach out and then touch my nose, did it fine with the right arm, sucker punched my mouth with the left.

Tldr dog got free on a walk, chased her, caught her. At the cost of my nervous system.


UPDATE: okay so I was there for 4-5 hours and they decided against further tests and keeping me. They think that after all that running past my usual limit and unprepared (honestly not that unfit) that it brought on something similar to a migraine. This then hit the week nerve links and brought back symptoms like my old stroke. 

Pretty much regained mobility and had to go sleep, it's brought back all the gym work to strengthen the nerves but they said it will regain in a week. 

Thanks for the well wishes guys and gals, still getting stink from the family because I shouted and made a scene for the neighbours with an ambulance but there's nothing that coulda been done.

Recently, I've been diagnosed with PTSD, Generalized and Social Anxiety, and Major Depressive Disorder. For 3.5 of those 4 years, I was with a girl. That ended in January. Shortly after that, I found another girl I was with for about a month. I relied on her too much and scared her off. I'm afraid I""m in the process of doing it again with someone else. I don't feel comfortable being on my own. More than anything in the world, I want to be independent and able to take care of myself, physically and emotionally. I need some help with self-care. I'm highly critical of myself and am unsure of how to react to compliments. I'm in desperate need of help. I have major body image and self confidence issues as well. It's so bad that I'm suicidal every day and I even spent 3 days in a mental institution. Any advice/support you guys can offer would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

do,"A few years back I did a gender essay on the novel, basically making the point that the novel had made a big step forward in the horror genre for not putting Clarice in an innocent and useless or femme fatale stereotype you usually get- don't think I read much more into it.

Now in my first year of university, looking at genre and gender in the same novel. For some reason, I seem to be thinking now that apart from Clarice, the novel is exactly the same in its portrayals as an absolutely typical horror novel. Even with her, some moments (especially the ""it matters"" moment with Crawford) seem like they're just put in there to point out how she's a woman- in addition to more mention of sex than I think is strictly necessary. Not entirely saying Harris' is doing this in a ""look at me, I'm progressive"", kind of way, but definitely not feeling the same way I did.

Anyone think the same/differently- just interested to know I suppose. This is one of my favourite books and I feel like I'm questioning my original assumptions.

do,"So I've tried in the past to keep a journal, and I've tried to talk to my friends about this, but I don't know what to do.

I was diagnosed as a kid with severe General Anxiety Disorder, and been mostly okay ever since going through therapy (never on meds, against the will of many psychiatrists), but this past year I realized I have depression. I'm in my 2nd year of university, and I kind of had an epiphany last semester when I realized that my crippling struggle with sadness and motivation maybe wasn't just random.

I also went through the suicide of one of my closest friends last semester. When she was alive, I never treated her with the love and friendship that I should have, that she showed me, and without getting too heavy into details, she messaged me about a week before it happened telling me she wasn't doing well, and we both agreed to meet. Her last words to me were (via text) ""I LOVE YOU"". I never responded. I still feel numb to this day.

Winter was especially difficult this year. I actually think that me depression may be seasonal, because I've had serious emotional breakdowns every year around Christmastime after moving to Scotland two years ago. This winter was crippling, though. I can't begin to describe the overwhelming despair that crushes your every thought. I kept having recurring images of my putting a revolver under my jaw, like a reflex that I couldn't turn off. I saw a psychiatrist, which was amazing, but I haven't been able to talk to anyone back here at uni because of the fucking abysmal mental health support they offer. In the words of a friend of mine ""if you're not suicidal, they don't give a shit"".

Now again, I really do think my depression is seasonal, because I've been doing so much better now that the days are getting longer. But even then, my life still feels kind of broken. I haven't missed anything compulsory this semester, but I can almost never find the motivation to go to my lectures, my gym attendance has been spotty, and while I was eating healthily for most of the semester, lately it's kind of fallen apart. I go out drinking fairly heavily quite often (I usually will engage in some kind of alcohol-related event 4 or 5 times a week). I don't think that I'm an alcoholic, but it's just that I don't live with any friends this year, and the only social events that go on tend to involve drinking. I don't want to just stay at home by myself every night. I also smoke weed fairly frequently, and take psychedelics every now and then for introspection and learning.

I'm really sorry for the wall of text, by the way. Just bear with me.

This semester, I've become really close with a girl from my choir here at uni (I'm a straight guy). I've only ever dated once, a serious relationship back in high school, so I'm not super experienced with this kind of thing. She is the kindest, most caring person I think I've ever met before. I don't think I've ever heard her say something negative to another human being before, and she literally inspires me in such a beautiful way. It doesn't hurt that she's really cute, too. We message quite a lot on and off, and always chat to each other during rehearsals, etc. I know that I should reach out to her and make plans, or something, but I feel as if I'm in a deadlock.

First of all, my choir is an amazing, tight-knit community, and I don't want to make it awkward for anyone, regardless of how it goes. But more than that, I feel like my life is too fucked up for her. I don't want to let someone into my life when my life feels like it's falling apart. I want to be what she deserves, and I know that right now that's not what I am. So I don't really know what to do.

do,"First time poster, sorry for the word salad

Firstly, my mom is the one who I suspect is the narcissist or at least has similar characteristics to one. I don't really like being around her. We barely talk and don't have a relationship. My dad is a great man but very non confrontational (unlike my mother). I think he married the wrong woman personally. I am a push over. never been a pot stirrer, do what people want of me, just try to not give my parents a reason to have a problem with me in order to limit interaction. 

I did a year at uni but due to suicidal attempts and what I consider a severe depression episode I dropped out. The stress I felt about having to call my parents and move back home was crushing. I could not sleep, could not eat, could not think. The guilt was eating me alive and I saw myself as the ultimate failure. I eventually called my mom and told her I did want to be at uni, it wasn't for me. I explained to her I wanted to work, save some money, and move out. I just wanted to live a little since I was the kind of kid who hid in his room all the time. Surprisingly, my mom said she was okay and even wanted me to move out. I was relieved and actually felt good for once.

When I got home things changed. My parents sat me down and told me I couldn't afford it even if I worked full time. My parents said I wasn't good with money and demanded to go through my transaction history on my bank account. It made me feel like shit because it didn't feel like they wanted to help me. Just tell me what to do or catch me in the act of doing the wrong thing. I remember how stressed I felt, twisting at the skin on my hand and I think even biting at it? My parents said nothing of this. After this periodically my mom would said ""you know you're not ready to move out right?"" Which just made me feel like such shit, I mean she did give real reasons why but it just made my brain run wild all the reason why I couldn't. My mom would also talk to my gf about this and trying to get her to convince me to stay.

That conversation was a year ago and recently I've been trying to save money, working full time, and just trying to figure out mg future. My sibling who lives close by knows how I feel and offered to let me move in with him. I was happy because it was a good price and was an opportunity for us to be closer. My parents are on vacation at this time. I was sick to my stomach knowing I had to tell them. My dad came back first and I told him of my plan. He was silent for a bit then said we would sit down and see if I could afford it. It was satisfied with this because at least he treated my wants as an option and wasn't angry with me. When my mom came home she immediately said no. Her two reasons why I can't move out is ""because I need you here and you owe us too much money"". I was so hurt and angry.
She wouldn't even talk to me about it. At that moment I decided I just wanted to move out and didn't care what they said. I'm still so conflicted. I rarely ever go against my parents but I just wanna do what I feel is right. The pressure and stress is suffocating.

do,"Drunk assholes last night at my work ordered a 2lb tray of cookies (I work at a fancy restaurant café) and refused to buy the tray that was already out for purchase saying it was “not fresh enough” when the cookies they were requesting had been out the SAME EXACT TIME the cookies from the tray had been. I told the server to tell them this and they still refused. It’s like they wanted to see me work extra hard or some shit? Normally this wouldn’t be the biggest deal because my manager would have told them that they could either purchase the tray out for purchase or wait until tomorrow, but it was closing time so my manager was in the back doing paperwork. So it takes like 15 minutes to weigh out these stupid cookies and organize them all pretty and fancy looking - mind you, it’s already passed closing time - and the server takes the cookies to the group who proceeds to drunkenly spill them ALL OVER THE FLOOR, and tells me to make them an entirely new tray. I was basically like ‘fuck that, I’m trying to leave. It’s fucking New Years’ so the server instead replaces the cookies cause I was beyond pissed. I wish that was all but the entire time I was waiting for them to leave they were being super assholey douchebags, talking about me  in complete ear-shot and flaunting their lavish lifestyle, “Yeah man, you should really come to my house sometime and look at my cars. Yours are nice but mine are better” type shit. 

If this is how you treat people working on holidays, or at any time, FUCK YOU, KINDLY GUZZLE 1000 COCKS."
do,"So i went out with a girl friend last night. It was fun hanging out with her but i was clearly the duff in every situation even though she repeatedly mentioned her boyfriend. 

We were in costume but neither of us did a slutty costume. But both of us were cute. But pretty much everyone who talked to us got my name then ignored me, even with a direct comment from me. It was horrible. 

Have any of you been through this? If so, how did you deal? I'm having a hard time not being super salty and hurt by it."
do,"I need some help about this one. I found out I was impacted by the Equifax breach and confronted my dreaded credit report.

I opened up some disputes. It seems I have sets of collections that they report as revolving, which open and close. The date of some of my accounts to come off is 2017, 2018, 2025. I disputed removing the ones with original debts over ten years ago, when I went to college with zero financial literacy and never knew about how loans could be sold for pennies on the dollar, or what I was getting into. There's also loans that I know I didn't take out. To make matters worse, my co-signer told his lawyer in bankruptcy about them and was told he was no longer a co-signer, but thought he was helping and payed on the debts, like $10 a month, which means some won't fall off now until 2025 because Citi calls paying on the debts indisputable.

I acknowledge I chose the wrong career with the expense of the schools I attended. I have severe mental illness compounded with alcoholism for treating myself for the suicidal impulses and anxiety that I developed with these fiscal issues. 

What do you think will happen to my disputes for loans that weren't mine, with companies I never used and at times when I didn't have to borrow money (weird times, mid-semesters) and years when I finally got financial aid? 

In the worse case, I want to file for bankruptcy myself because a lot of lawyers laugh at my case, though people have successfully discharged them in bankruptcy before. I'm too unstable to work and now have a small child with someone from a traditional Asian background who wants the child to be with me for the first couple years &amp; with all the horrors of daycare &amp; the high incidents of DHS getting called on places &amp; them still not being in business, I agree and want to stay home to protect her in ways I wasn't, like from loan sharks, etc.

Any ideas? This is a milestone around my neck. Comparing credit scores with my partner, he's got less than 2,000 and the same score as me. The difference is that I can never pay mine off. Every single partner prior has left me explicitly because of the loans, or refused to marry because of them after 4, 5 year relationships.

ds,"I don't know what it's like to be not depressed.
Hi my name is ahmulz and I'm depressed. 

Been depressed arguably since I was 15 (25 now). Looking back on my childhood, I can definitely see some signs of childhood depression. The past year has been particularly bad in terms of my mental health. 

I'm better than I was a year ago. I've joined a gym. I do pole dancing. I got a cat. I have a therapist. I'm medicated. I volunteer more. I see occasional good things in myself. I'm not actively suicidal anymore. Yet... I'm still depressed. I've changed my life so fucking much and I'm still fucking depressed. I still have more work to do to ""fix myself"" (fucking diet, fucking exercise, bullshit mindfulness) but it all just feels like so much goddamn work at the end of the day. 

I don't know what I'm working towards. I can't comprehend a world in which I don't wake up in an apartment that needs to be cleaned because I'm too tired and too lazy to do it or that I don't spend my time in a numb, self-loathing void. I don't know how people get through their days liking themselves or liking their life. 

It's frustrating and lonely. 

There are some days where I wish I was suicidal because the rest of my life wouldn't feel so long and full of drudgery. I can't see me getting well. I just can't."
ds,"Weekends are the worst
There's nothing to distract myself on the weekends. I did spend time with friends Friday and Saturday, but the majority of the time I just sit at home and watch youtube or do some other dumb shit. I've been trying to quit drinking and smoking weed, but they really numbed the weekend away to make it bearable. Now I'm just a sad sap with nothing to do. I am trying to take up hobbies to fill the time but it seems pointless. The worst part is that I have had some really good days this week and I thought that maybe I was better. The depression is worse after I've felt genuinely happy for the first time in a long time. I've been overwhelmed with cravings for alcohol all weekend and I've been trying to get some homework done, but all I can focus on is wanting to drink. Maybe I should just get drunk to make them go away for a while."

In its totality it doesn't have to be about wins and loses,  or what I failed to do.  Neither does it have to be about my past years and the thoughts that come with immense feelings that appears to haunt me.  The behaviors and mentality that I have doesn't have to be the end all be all.  One major thing to include that its not about growth or conquering something in life.  I'm not living to grow or to become strong after a catastrophic situation.  I am looking for my spirit to simply just settle.  I'm not seeking any advice nor trying to raise my fist towards challenges.  I'm not seeking any of that just a settling of the inner me.  To me,  that is important than anything else because I would gladly be able to live with that when I one day be out of this earth. I'm not the goal oriented type.  Its not about climbing this ladder of life. I'm not here for any of what most people are striving for.  I seek for my spirit to settle for all these years.  That is what I'm chasing.  Most people are chasing dreams,  families,  success,  marriages,  money,  respect,  and fame,  but not this human.  More power to them and I'm sure they will obtain all those things but I for one am not seeking to obtain.  The human game is a serious thing filled with losses and wins.  I don't wanna count anymore nor try to get to the next level of life.  Cycling through the infinite regrets and regression. The only goal is for this spirit to settle some type of way.  I'm gunning for an internal calmness.  Something that can penetrate and flood the mind of mine.  Something that can provide some internal at ease like affect for myself.  So I say to my spirit,  I hope you settle."

Hello everyone. I hope we all make it out of depression.

They know of my anxiety and depression. My mom drove me today and I didn't talk at all because I was in one of those moods I get in. I love my Mother a lot and she is very dear to me. I want to get out of this and become someone, but it is very hard. Anxiety has suffocated me and I'm afraid to go out in public due to feeling awkward and confidence issues. I have been crying a lot because I have lost hope in myself. When I look at pictures of myself or my family happy, I get emotional. The years are flying by me and I have no way to catch them. I see everyone around me getting older and I'm getting extremely saddened by it. My anxiety prevents me from going out in public and I waste away my days.

I was at a party last night with some friends, and the whole time I saw people talking and hanging out like they were best friends and had known each other for years. It made me really sad because even though I have a wide circle of acquaintances, my mental illness and my fear of rejection makes it so hard to actually get close to people. I’ve been in college for a year and a half and I still don’t have any close friends that I text or hang out with. My friends from high school are all off at different colleges living their own lives now, so we aren’t close anymore. I kept thinking about this last night at the party and I got so sad that I left.

Obligatory I've been living with depression (BP2) and anxiety for much of my life as a young adult.

One of the most significant is how I sound to myself and others.

i’ve been feeling depressed since i was 19, i’m 21 now. i learned to live with my depression. i took group therapy, then individual therapy but didn’t find comfort/couldn’t open up to my therapists. i don’t talk to anyone about my issues, so kinda now have a feeling of numbness. i kinda learned to live like this. i feel normal, i used to feel like there was a cloud over my head at all times. 

My older brother is severely depressed & was prescribed Zoloft. he offered me a one & i took it in the late afternoon. i felt more outgoing, him & i hung out. 
The next day, i went to work & was doing an outstanding job with my performance.  i didn’t mind being at work. after i had a break at work, i ate a bagel & then i was in the GREATEST mood ever. i was so happy. a customer even called me out for being so smiley, but i couldn’t help it. i cleaned my entire house, i applied for Spring classes for school & even was thinking of long term dreams of becoming a lawyer. i loved how positive i was feeling.

ds,"I have no idea what to do
My husband and I got into an argument last night that has lasted until this morning. Through out the entire argument, he has called me horrible names and hurt me deep. I thought i was almost over my depression, I thought i was getting better, but the things he has said has taken me from where I thought I was all the way back down to extremely emotional and having suicidal thoughts.

The argument started because I was talking too loudly to his son while trying to correct his behaviour. I am 38 weeks pregnant, and lately have been easily annoyed and upset by the boy not listening to me. My husband called me a bunch of hurtful things because I tried to explain why I was so upset. Later on in the night he told me my mom and oldest sister were no longer allowed to visit me for the birth of our child. Then he spent several more hours talking about how they were ""rot gut whores"" and how he doesn't want them around HIS son all because 2 years ago my sister invited me to a christmas dinner she knew I wasnt going to show up for and didn't specifically include my husband in the invitation. Yet his mom is coming a few weeks after, and she had left him and his brother to fend for themselves in a trailer in the middle of a forest only showing up to bring them food when they called her and begged her for it. But because she ""hasn't done anything to offend"" me, he is totally ok with her showing up.

Now he's talking about how if I want my mom to be here so bad, I can leave with her when she visits. And I've fully expressed how depressed I am to him and he isn't even worried in the slightest. He just keeps refering to my past as a teen who would sleep with practically anyone to try to get some sort of pleasure out of life, saying he bets I want to go back to that, that i would treat his son better if he were black, and that i would try harder to not upset my husband if he were black.

Part of me hopes something goes REALLY wrong in the birthing process and that I will die or be put in a coma from it. I've never felt so useless, stranded, and alone in my entire life."

ds,"How much longer can I fake it?
I'm 33, had a full-time job for several years and have a young son.  I took a leave from work in 2014 for mental illness, at which point I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, prescribed Zoloft and was back at work when my short term disability ran out.  This was the first time I'd been on anti-depressants.  I felt tired all the time, had no sex drive, and started gaining weight, but at least I was functional.  

Over the next year, I received a few verbal warnings and 1 written warning at work about my poor performance.  Eventually, the mask broke and I was on leave again in 2015.  This time I was away for much longer, was diagnosed w/ dysthymia, tried several different medications, found out that just about every SSRI gave me horrible side effects (sweating, nausea, insomnia, no sex drive, I'm actually thinking now that maybe they caused serotonin syndrome) and eventually landed on Remeron and Wellbutrin.  This combo actually started to work, without any side effects (except for weight gain, which I've been managing with a diet now).  This time, I returned to work because I received notice in the mail that my employment was going to be terminated because it was coming up on 2 years without being at work.  I figured if I was going to be fired for not returning, I may as well return, make some money and worst thing that happens is I get fired anyways.  I was not better when I returned to work, I was functional, I was able to smile, but the low mood persisted in a big way.

And so here I am, still working, trying to fake it everyday, feeling like a house of cards thats ready to topple.  I'm afraid because if I go off work again that will have been 3 leaves of absence, and I really don't think I could show my face around here anymore after that.  I remember how horrible my life felt when I was on medical leave.  I remember falling behind on child support, having to borrow money from my parents.  I remember trying to convince my girlfriend that my low sex drive was because of meds and not because of her.  I remember trying to convince an insurance company that I'm sick, while simultaneously trying to convince myself that I can get better.  I remember feeling like a useless waste of skin that drained on the resources of everyone that dared to care about me.  I guess what I'm saying is I know, right now, I'm suffering from depression, and I'm afraid of what might happen if I admit that again."

ALL OF THESE SYMPTOMS happened before I got pregnant a second time, and have been intensified since becoming pregnant...

—I’m constantly moody. My emotions change with the drop of a hat.
—I’m constantly wondering why my husband stays with me (he is a GREAT GREAT supporting, caring lover) and am always thinking he deserves better
—I hate waking up on the weekends because I feel like I have no purpose (my almost-three year old is pretty easy to manage despite being rambunctious)
—I am too self conscious to even get out and do something if I know the place I want to go to will be crowded
—I have NO motivation to do anything. Walking to get some fresh air? Nope. Getting out of the house just for a moment to change scenery? Not a chance.
—Everything that I try to do I have NO attention span to continue.

Nothing feels authentic when i’m here. There have been beautiful times in my life and 90% of them are when i’ve been abroad.

This is my first time and please i need some answers on what to do, why does life work this way, i fucking hate that things had to go wrong this fucking way. My depression is taking over me and my family is worried about me.
 For the first time in high school i liked this girl for about 7 months and during that time we became best friends and i always thought she would like me if i cared for her and treated her right. i always acted the same way as her and found out we thought the same sometimes. We always talked to each other including late night till 2 or 3 am and we knew everything about each other and we always were with each other but instead she liked some asshole who didn't like me and always kept lying about me to her. She never believed what he said about me but chose to love him and be with him more and they always were with each other after class and it made me jealous and angry on why she would do this. One day i invited her to some place with her and my friends but she decided to also want to take the asshole and i got frustrated and ended our friendship. she got angry at me and decided to leave too. but one day the asshole decided to leave her because of a fight they had and she starts crying to me on the phone and i try to help her get over him but it hurts me when she says she loves this person who kept lying to her about me and other things and he was known to be a bad person and she only dated one guy before but he was super nice and i didn't understand why she liked him and she said she didn't either, it was only that she felt happy around him. She is such a pretty girl and most of the guys in the school agree and thought me and her were dating but they never knew she really liked this asshole and during the time they hanged out she kept asking me if they were right for each other and she said she would separate from him but she didn't listen to me. Instead they got closer and me and this asshole got into more fights with each other but she would rather not say anything and still be with him. Now she is actually separating from him after all this time. Why did she do this to me after everything we've been through because i treated her way better but she did this to me and i dont know should i go back to her after what she did. Its been 2 weeks and i haven't talked to her since then and my mind has been thinking of ways to beat myself up because of this problem.

I’ve been talking to him about my depression and my feelings, and he usually doesn’t offer the most support. Most of the time I just want someone to listen, maybe hold my hand and tell me everything will be okay. 

Well today, he blocked me. He blocked my phone number and he completely blocked me on all social media’s. All because he got tired of listening to me talk about how I feel. I told him today I wished I was dead and I felt all alone. And he blocked me.

ds,"The Irony of Loneliness in an Overpopulated World
As I spend more time in the presence of depression, I've tried to apply a further focus to understand what's actually going on in my head. Dealing with the sudden appearance of depression has been a nightmare and a half to deal with to say the least. So in response, I regularly attempt to interpret the spiral of self loathing thoughts and whirlwind of emotions that march throughout my mind. 

My initial reaction to a diagnosis of major depression and multiple failed suicide attempts has been to run away from everything that reeks of painful memories, both theoretically and literally:

* I write this post 7,000 kilometres from my home country, in Japan, where I aim to live for the next couple of years. 
* ‎I've ghosted those whom I use to call my close friends.
* I left all social media in order to avoid contacting people that I knew, and because looking at how happy other people were brought me down. 
* ‎I changed my image drastically over the past year as an outward expression of the fact that I'm trying to change as a person.

It's here in Japan that I've come to a terrifying realisation. I can't run from depression. Here I am, in a country where people speak a totally different language and immersed in a totally different culture to my own, writing a post about depression. 

Recently, I was walking the streets in search for job opportunities when I sunk into a depressed mood and began thinking about my place in the world (which always turns out well). Nothing actually matters. We work in order to pay rent, in order to stay in the same place, so that we can reliably keep a job so that we can pay rent. It's in this meaninglessness that humans as social beings look to others for comfort. Our lives are but a meaningless speck in an expanding universe. That's quite the depressing thought... And it is. But why is it that when another body's lying on top of mine, or when I'm held in a warm embrace, this thought doesn't have any impact on me?

I've done quite a bit of thinking by myself,  and have talked to a bunch of people from back in the psychiatric ward on what 'fixes' us. And the unfortunate answer for most of us is... Nothing. We can't be fixed. It's just how our minds work. But what if we don't have to be fixed? The hardest part about depression for me, is the intensity of the loneliness I feel. When I'm at my worst, I'm so focused on my own loneliness and the meaninglessness of my relationships, that the few connections I do have, I dismiss. Now, this isn't the case for all people suffering from depression. For a lot of people, their negative emotions are driven by a sense of worthlessness,  meaninglessness or sadness. 

But the general consensus is, although we can't 'fix' ourselves, we can have people around us to support us when we're at our lowest. And it makes sense that as social beings, human intimacy provides us with a safety net for when depression's hitting us the hardest. 

Unfortunately for most of us, the type of physical and emotional intimacy that we strive for is unobtainable. In my life, depression's caused me to push away the people that I've spent time building connections with, and has limited the amount of contact I've had with strangers and people that I COULD connect with.

I think it's ironic. It's ironic that in such an overpopulated world, depression is such a big issue. We're the people that need intimacy the most, so you'd think we'd be in a position where intimacy is more readily available. But that's not how the world works. Our lives are still meaningless. We still hate ourselves. And we're still alone."

ds,"I used to know exactly what I wanted to do in life, but now when I look foreword all I see is eventual suicide.
My whole life I’ve wanted to go enroll in Animal Studies at NYU to eventually get a degree in zoology. It’s been my dream for as long as I remember. I was going to get good grades, get my driver’s license at 16, stay in shape, eat healthy, get married, have kids, earn enough scholarships that most of my college was paid for, and get a job that I loved. Basically be the perfect woman. But now, everything seems so impossible. I’m currently failing most of my classes because I can’t find the motivation to do assignments, which causes anxiety to wrack up even more than usual. It’s just been awful. Anyways, when I try to look foreword once again that my young, stupid self had planned out when she was little, all I can see is... nothing. I just want to be clear that the only reason I’m still on this earth is that I know suicide would crush my family. I want help, I really do, but my pride won’t let me ask. And even though I (temporarily) decided to live, the call of the peace after death still calls out to me. It reminds me of our past flirting through the angry wounds criss-crossing my arms and the knife bloodied with my own blood under my mattress. I just want, more than anything, for this pitiful excuse of an existence to end."

ds,"I've lost 4 Marines to depression and almsost lost a 5th. None saw combat. I need help understanding.
Hi. 

I just had my 4th funeral in 7 years for yet another Marine. A few days ago another one called me with a gun to his head and i talked him down.

These 5 Marines, as far as i can tell suffer/suffered from depression. Pretty much every one of them was intelligent (like way too smart for the Marine Corps) and each of them stood out as ""the funny one"". To say very few people understood they were struggling would be an understatement. 

The Marine Corps has done a lot to try and help suicidal Marines, but all our training videos depict some ""clearly distressed"" person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves. In reality none of these people let on the depth of their suffering and only one made an attempt to seek help.

What I'm asking:

As someone who has never suffered depression (Ive been ""depressed"" but that was from external factors like a job not working out or a girl leaving me. I consider that normal human emotion), how do I identify Marines under my care thst may be suffering and need help.

They are NOT giving the outward signs in the stupid ""Lance Corporal Decker video"" we watch once a year.

Thanks.

Edit: been at work all day then went to visit a former Marine that dealt with some serious issues in his day but is doing well now. Mulled over a lot of this with him, then checked back in here and saw all these wonderful responses.

I have read every one, some several times. I have a lot to consider and learn, but thank you for helping me find some direction.

One thing i didn't mention is my role in all this. Im not sone big wig commander with tools at my disposal.  Im a newly promoted Sergeant and a squad leader with just a handful of guys under me. The one we just burried was not in my platoon, but i knew him enough to be deeply saddened by his loss. The other three were guys i was close to back in training, but i was not currently stationed with them when it happened. In fact i found out about all three of them on Facebook. 

This recent one, and the one that called me with suicidal thoughts, have made me want to be much more aware of the mental health of those around me. The scary thing to me is, even with hindsight, i wouldn't have picked these five guys out of the lot as having ANY kind of issues, let alone suicidal tendencies. 

I have also noticed, maybe because of my nature or leadership style, that im the one people tend come to with problems. I make it known that im here for that purpose, and people take me up on it. So I guess now i want to make sure i can spot when someone needs more help than they may be openly asking for. I will be more vigilant in my assessments of the needs of those under my watch.

Thank you all for the detailed and informed replies."

Yes I have a supportive family and yes I have friends that are willing to listen to my bullshit, but dose that really lessen my inner turmoil and trouble with my mind, so I have to be fucking stabbed by my own brother to make it legit ? 


Yes I know nobody liked school, but did they all make themselves believe it was school or nothing, and when they ended up at a dead and was convinced that there life was over !? Did all kids struggle with basics in school ?! 

Did every kid end up feeling alone no Mather what he or she did there entire life ?! Did they have to feel so alone and unconnected ?! 


I know full well that anyone else wold have done a better job in life then me, I know I’m wasted potential and probably will never live up to the standers my brother set before me, don’t you think I know that ?! Don’t you think at eats at me almost every waking moment of my existence?! 


Am I really that defective that I am just not good enough ?! 

Just because things are moving forward and good for now doesn’t make my feelings and inner turmoil go away ! 


Do you think I wanted/want to be this sad excuse of a human being ?! 


I can’t say anything to anyone, I have learnt that I not only feel alone but I am alone, people just end up getting tired of my shit anyway, so I guess I’ll have to go back to bottling everything inside again, maybe when the glass brakes and I cave i will be free, maybe I will find my freedom in death....idk anymore I just don’t know

ds,"Why my relationship is killing me
Okay, disclaimer, former relationship... but it still has a huge effect on my life.

This girl was my best friend and my first serious relationship.
I met her when I first got depressed, and we went to the same church together.

I told her then that I didn't feel ready for a relationship, but she essentially stalked me all those (5) years ago.

Christmas 2016, after dealing with a crap load more grief and depression, I was essentially forced into a relationship with her.  I had just got over my main stint of depression the previous September, and my life was getting better.

We still hung out as friends, but she kept pushing for more.

However, she is so messed up.  I have to say that now.
I do still love her, and that will probably never change, but she needs professional help, and my mistake was thinking I could help her.  She was my best friend after all.

So, after a string of breakups, moving too slow and moving too fast, as well as her cheating on my several times, she finally called it quits one week after my birthday (November just gone).
I had no say, because she'd throw a tantrum, but I had to take the initiative.

Why?  Because she no longer wanted to have my baby.

In August, she fell pregnant.  This could have been the week prior the Anniversary of our first kiss, but the nurse dated it on that specific date.  That was one of the nights she cheated on me, with her friend's boyfriend, but it was ""just a kiss"".

She tried to miscarry by drinking heavily for the next few weeks before coming to me about it; she had broken up with me the day after she cheated.

I asked her there and then if she wanted to keep it.  She said yes.
We went to speak to my mum.  My mum asked her.  She said yes.
She wanted to announce the pregnancy, to start all the planning, and looking forward to the future.

I got a well paying job to provide for our future, a job I travelled hundreds of miles for each week, and it was only for a few months.

But whilst I was away, she decided she missed all the drinking, drugs, and sex she was missing out on.  She wanted to live with her friends (who she actually hates living with at times), and countless other reasons.

However, she kept stringing me along until the scan, where she sent me a photo of our child before telling me she wanted to abort it.  Oh, and I had planned a weekend away for us to relax and see some friends.

She had me believe this was the start of my happy ever after, before ripping it away from me.

She didn't speak to me for two weeks.

When I finally did manage to get in touch, it was to collect my stuff.  I took a mutual friend with me, the act as a buffer, and they couldn't believe the stuff that she said to me.

Then I get a load of hate off her because people are contacting her about her choices.
Remember, she has been posting on FB all about the baby, making sure everyone knows.

She hasn't spoken to me since.  She has blocked me anyway she can, even on WhatsApp only recently... not that it matters, because she wants nothing to do with me.

This was my best friend, and my stalker, who for years wanted to be with me, have a family with me, worried I wouldn't want her because of PCOS, and got jealous over people talking to me on Twitter, and kittens!  She couldn't even handle me showing up with chocolates and flowers!
All that I've done for her, supported her, sacrificed for her... and this is how she treats me.

Now, I am pro-life, and pro-choice.  I gave her that choice, and she wanted to go ahead.  I didn't force her or convince her.  She led me.
She set me up, just to rip out my heart.

Seriously, if you only knew the half of it.  The card she wrote for me for my birthday alone would have anyone convinced.

But now, she is living her life.  She is out drinking, smoking, doing drugs and sleeping with anything she can get her claws into.
She has restarted her YouTube ""career"", and quite frankly, they're boring videos.

Maybe she'll do better.  I hope not.  But I think that's normal.

So why this post?
Because it is killing me.  I don't know how, but I'm still kicking.  Depression is creeping at my door, and I do have horrible days, bad days where I am so demotivated.

Yet, I cannot stop thinking about her.  She has me broken, in ruins... even my faith has been hit hard.
I don't understand what changed.  I don't understand she did what she did.  Why did she play me for so long just to hurt me?

Everyone tells me to forget about her, and no one would allow me to go back to her (even if it was a possibility).

All I want to do is to forget about her, because as the title says... this relationship is killing me."

I’ve realized that if I can’t talk to someone about my feelings then the next best thing is to write them down and seek advice from reddit so here I am.
I’m on campus right now preparing for my midterm and my confidence is at an all time low. I haven’t even seen the paper and already I feel as if I’ve lost. I never thought I would reach such a low in my life. Something weird happened today. I finally set up a countdown timer to the day my exam results are announced. That seemed like the next logical step and it made complete sense to me in a weird way. The only thing that made me remove that was talking to my parents and seeing the hope and love for me in their eyes. I know my life isn’t truly mine and that if I hurt myself then I also hurt other people but it’s just getting too much. The thought is always there in my mind and for the past few days that voice has gotten stronger. I’ve been through this period before and had come out nearly unharmed and at the beginning of the year I was feeling optimistic about what’s to come but that lasted all of one month. The future I was dreaming of looks bleak and distant and with every passing minute that future keeps on going farther and farther away from me. I try very hard to keep my guard up near people I know and love but it’s becoming harder and harder to do so. I used to think that I was destined to do some good in the world but maybe that was just me being delusional. It’s getting harder to keep the tears in. Whenever I used to feel numb, I used to punch the wall just to feel something but even that is not helping now. All I wanna do is talk to someone and pour my heart out but I don’t know if I have the strength left to do that. Getting out of bed is starting to feel like a struggle and for the first time in a while I’m afraid of myself, of what I might do if things don’t go my way. I know that this is not the end of the line but why does it feel like it is? How can anyone recover from such a failure? It’s gotten so bad that I would much rather prefer that I disappeared than having to tell my parents what’s wrong. Depression is nothing new for my university and it wouldn’t be the first time that someone took a drastic step and now I know why they did what they did. The pressure and stress which comes with a university as respected as mine, is just too much to handle. I’m almost inclined to reveal my university’s name just in case someone’s able to figure out who I am and I can finally get the respite I desire so much. All around me I see happy faces and I can only hope that one day I can leave all this behind me and be happy but in the meantime I guess I just have to struggle on and wait for the light at the end of the tunnel."

So yesterday was my 18th birthday, and here my dumbass was expecting it to be different than all my other ones, but boy was I wrong. It's nice to know that no one gives a fuck about you. You can cry, and scream all you want but at the end of the day, no one is gonna be able to understand you, and the deep well that has been buried within your mind. So what if you grew up rejected by every girl, guy, and person? So what if you've just turned 18 and endured waves upon waves of mental abuse? At the end of the day, when you're laying in your bed, and your demons are starting to swallow you whole and fill up the bowl, what do you do? You face it. You indulge yourself in them until the pain is numb, and you can't feel anything anymore. It may not be healthy, but it's better than suffering. Happy fucking birthday bro, have your cake."
ds,"Desperate for advice or input; I lost and am losing everything held dear to me right now due to multiple reasons, and would just like to hear some different recommendations
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I DONT KNOW WHERE I WENT WRONG OR HOW TO FEEL BETTER!!

I've typed this out way too many times so I'm gonna do my best to sum it up as short as I can:

Last week me and my gf of 10 and a half months broke up, i was devestated. In that little time I have experienced more love, more of life than ever before and it felt like we'd been together forever. I thought, maybe we would work things out on our own and get back together when the time was right, even though i knew it was a stretch, but i was also okay with just being friends if that was what the world had planned. 2 days after the break up im talking to both of my best friends who are also (kinda?) friends with her, and they both tell me that she basically told them she had absolutely no intention of ever getting back with me because she wanted to ho around without the commitment of a relationship. She also openly bragged to one of them that she had cheated on me multiple times during our relationship. This all made me very angry and on top of that hurt. The same night just after finding all of this out I find out from my other friend that she had called her and bragged about hooking up with this one kid who, during our entire relationship, she told me she hated and that we BOTH already had bad history with, and fooled around. Then later (AGAIN) she goes on instagram live with my bestfriend who is kinda being fake just to see how she really is and openly brags about blocking me (which added to the hurt cause i had done nothing but try to respect her wishes since the split in hopes that we could at least part on good terms ya know) , saying that i was 'fucking crazy' and that she never wanted anything to do with me ever again. There's more in terms of details but thats the basic general idea of the past week for me.

I dont know how i feel or what to say.
I feel hurt and i feel abandoned and i feel stupid and i feel not good enough and i feel like a complete fuck up i feel so fucking awful its not even funny. Im losing my friends because my stupid brain cant get over this and im constantly going to them to talk about it because that's the way i like to deal with stuff, but they've heard the same thing one too many times and i get that i just dont know what else to do. Im tired of thinking about it, im tired of not being able to confront her but my friends say its not a good idea because its not gonna do anything but make her think even higher of herself for having fucked me up so badly and wont at all make her change her ways. I want to completely forget but at the same time a part of me wants to work everything out just so i can mean something to this person who meant absolutely everything to me at one point again, WHY?? 
Why does my brain, or heart, or whatever still crave attention from her, or maybe even her herself, even after knowing all of this? Why am i so fucking pathetic? What can I do to move on that doesn't involve just ignoring the problem and moving forward but rather coming to peace with it and myself and blossoming?

Everybody who questions psychiatry often gets the response “you’re stigmatising people with mental health issues”

What’s more stigmatising? Telling people they have biologically broken brains with insufficient brain chemistry, and bad genes? Psychiatrists/psychotherapist within the biopsycho model of human emotions, only drug, or involuntarily “hopstialise” people

Telling people they can’t overcome their problems with life due to their bad brain which doesn’t operate correctly and the only thing they can do is take a psychiatric drug?

Subjecting people to isolation and distancing themselves from people as “different” due to “mental illness” and subjugating the “norm” from the “mentally ill” subjecting people to drug trials they have ended up in suicide and mass homocide, all for the progress of “psychiatric medicine”

Telling people that they have biological genetic brain diseases like “schizophrenia” and they’ll never really live a normal life.

Yet we’re the stigmatisers? YOU’RE the one who solicitates a lawyer when you have tried a psychiatric drug that almost made you kill yourself now you want to fight psychiatry but you’re okay with kids being chemically lobotomised on Ritalin?

How many more expansions of diagnosis in the dsm? does it have to be to wake you sheeples up that Collectivising human behaviour and giving them a label of “disease” with symtomps does it have to be to tell you that these behaviours aren’t found through cellular pathology, brain scans, blood tests, or some medical diagnostic criteria?

How many more deaths, school shootings, senseless violence, suicide by the administration of drugs? Will it have to be to wake you people up that psychiatry has killed more people throughout the entire history of the world than the Jewish halocaust?

It’s time to wake up and see that the “stigma of mental illness” is just psychiatric propaganda to deflect all the damage and life’s runid by their tortuous domain and authoritarian political reign.

Wearing a badge upon your head saying I’m “bipolar” is self deprecative as you’ve surrended your mental factilites and human experience/emotion for the NIMH who’ve admitted you can’t define “mental illness” and want to use you as some priori for the campaigns to sell treatment therapy and drugs.

Own titles like “I beat depression” I “beat bipolar” not resigning yourself to a pathetic existence of numbing your emotions and dying 20 years younger on psychiatric drugs."
ds,"Functional depression??
Is anyone here in a similar boat? I have a bachelor degree, girlfriend, am athletic although exercise on and off. Having trouble finding a stable career but i’m optimistic. Tried getting a masters degree but it’s not working out so far. Anyways what i’m trying to say is that on paper my life seems ok, but i’ve tried a few therapists, medications and nothing is getting me out of this hole of low mood, motivation, and occasional thoughts. I still skip meals, eat junk, sleep inconsistently, have days where i’m ready to quit everything. I do have little people to talk to and feel connected with even though i have parents, and some friends. It’s been several years now like this. Does it get better? That’s what people say, am i missing something? Am i overthinking everything? Anyways thanks for reading."
ds,"I Saw Someone Jump Today
I was driving over the main bridge in my city this afternoon. This bridge has been used before. I was driving downtown and I noticed someone on the opposite side of the railing. My girlfriend was in the passenger seat and before I could say anything to her. They were gone. I didn't get to see their face and if I did I think it would've destroyed me. I crossed the bridge, pulled over and called the police. I wish I could've helped, yelled something, gotten out of my car. I don't know. I didn't even know her but I feel as though I've lost someone close.

I struggle with depression myself and I just wish I could've talked to her, I know we could've related on some level. That almost excites me, getting to relate to someone, even over something sad, to just feel that. Thanks for listening."
ds,"Anyone already afraid of Valentine's Day?
If not, what's your method for not getting even more suicidal that day?"
ds,"lonely
Despite having great family that thinks the world of me, I just feel so damn alone all the time. I have great friends that reassure me that I'm not alone, but I struggle forcing myself to believe that. I hate this about myself because I'm grateful to have what I have, and I am god awful at showing my appreciation for this. A lot of the time I'm mentally just not here at all. Most days I can't stop feeling so shitty to the point where some days I'll take 5 hour naps throughout the day just to avoid any shallow conversation with other people. I've tried going into things with a positive mindset, but I still just felt distant.

Any advice?"
ds,"DAE not tell anyone about their depression for fear of being called an attention whore?
When I was a kid I was constantly getting called an attention seeker or an attention whore, mostly by the wonderful folks on r/teenagers, and know I’m not honest to anyone about my depression because I’m afraid I’ll come of as an attention whore and I don’t deserve to get help. DAE relate?"
ds,"I thought things were getting better...
Sorry for the little rant... I just needed to say this somewhere.

After recently getting out of the hospital for a(nother) attempt at my life, I was surrounded by family and friends who want to support me. For a couple days this almost gave me a high, thinking that maybe I really am glad I wasn't able to go through with it or that maybe I was beating these years of depressiveness. Not even just after a week of getting out of the mental ward, I fantasize about what I could have done differently to have made sure I died that night. Going forward I thought I would be happy being able to see my younger siblings and my dog again, yet the only thing I can think of is them knowing I tried killing myself, and that I have added just another thing to deal with and another burden on them. I will now be treated with *care* and people will be on guard around me, and I didn't want to do that to them. This semester has started again and I have already missed the first week, and while part of me just wants to drop everything, I can't afford to start paying back the loans. I just want to curl into a ball and not exist and have to deal with it all.

TL:DR - trying to take the easy way out has just made everything harder."

ds,"Ever Feel FB ""Friends"" Are Lying Out Their Asses?
For real. How the fuck can people post about life being great, life is so good, and being blessed? It's like they want to rub your nose in it how wonderful their life is. While you're wallowing in alcohol/drugs, in a room by yourself, contemplating suicide. 

Sometimes, I just want to call people out on this bullshit but I don't post on FB anymore. No possible way these people are that happy and enjoy life so much. Is it just narcissists? Or are people really this happy and get all the luck in the world?"
ds,"I am okay, until I have to be alone with my thoughts.
I enjoy the company of my friends, even though I'm very bad at talking to them. When I'm out with them or rehearsing with my band I feel okay. I almost feel depression free for the time being— I feel like everything will be okay, that I got this, that I am in control, that it doesn't matter that I have a lot of homework due in the next week cause I'll go home and get it done. I feel strong and motivated. 

And then I have to go home. I am no longer in the company of people who love me, so I start feeling anxious. I start believing they actually fucking hate me. I lose it. I hate being alone because my horrible thoughts are a lot easier to hear over the silence of no one talking."
ds,"I just feel trapped
I'm finishing up my Masters degree and just feel hopeless right now. I hate school. I'm starting to hate my field of study too. I play the trumpet. But to be honest, I'm not very good at it. High notes, any other trumpet player will be able to understand. In the past two years, my playing has underwent some other terrible thing where I hesitate at the start of anything I play. It's 100 percent mental. I've made some strides in it, but it still comes back. For the past two years, it has made me feel like I can't even play a simple fucking melody to someone if asked. Trumpet is basically my adventure, but it seems like I just cause myself pain. I want to keep working on it, but boy it hurts my soul to suck and to keep not doing well. On top of that, I struggle with my weight. I love fast food. I know it's bad, but I use it to cope. I also would love to stop watching porn. I'm addicted to that. I've been addicted to that since I was probably in the 4th grade. I just feel trapped, like I don't have the self control or am not smart enough to discipline myself to fix these problems. I'm just sick of being a loser in life. Is there any hope?"

ds,"I sob thinking about my painfully wasted young years
I'm going to write this hopefully without stopping to think myself into madness with corrections and such. Too late I just backspaced two whole sentences! There is this big fucking hard block of concrete in my head that stops me from doing anything including things I like such as drawing and reading. I love going on tumblr and pinterest and deviantart to look at the amazing drawings and paintings people are able to create. Sometimes though, I get really jealous of the fictional characters in the fandoms. Heck, I get really jealous of people in my life and around the world; young people. I just get this sinking, dreadful feeling inside my chest realizing that I'm wasting my young years doing nothing. I'm 24 now, and looking back on my life I've just been a sad, pathetic underachiever with no drive or history of doing anything adventurous. I'm wasting my young years. I'm wasting my young years. It plays over in my head all the time. I can't get my brain to shut off. Every night before I go to bed it plays over and over. I'm just so sad and disappointed in my life and how I've done nothing with it. Even as a little kid I never did anything fun and I don't have any wild stories of adventure, excitement, nor things like ""Lol we were dumb kids yada yada...We did this all the time yada yada..."" I'm sorry for the rant. Writing it out didn't help me get the chants out of my head. I'm so sad guys. And I know that fictional characters are deliberately made to be fascinating and have amazing lives, but there are people who were born 5 years before me (who are real, yes) and they are really living their lives to the fullest and are doing amazing things. Right now I want to go out, rent a solid 4x4, and drive to some god knows where designated dark space and lay on my back and gaze at the stars in the night sky. I want to go do something fun and amazing, but knowing I've wasted so many years being depressed in bed, on my computer, sleeping, and just doing nothing will haunt me forever.

Please take me back to being a little girl again. Let me try again please."
ds,"Am I Depressed?
While I've been distraught and suicidal on and off since age fifteen, I've never been formally diagnosed with anything because I don't trust the mental-health establishment. I've only visited a shrink twice: once when forced by parents, a second time when pressured by a partner.

Because of this, I'm reluctant to claim I'm depressed except in the loose, colloquial sense. Instead, I feel my rage and despair flow quite appropriately from my failure to fulfill my desires, achieve my dreams, and so on. I hate being alive and would adore a sudden death, sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm depressed, right?

I don't experience many of the symptoms of formal depression: I sleep pretty well most of the time, I eat okay, and I'm socially active. (I feel abjectly isolated, but empirically I spend a fair amount of time with friendly acquaintances at events and so on.)

I resist the medical model of my mental state because it assumes the problem's with me rather than with the world. I figure I'd be okay if I had the basic level of social success normal folks have: a number of close friends and a healthy romantic/sexual relationship with one or more partners.

I'm becoming increasingly confident my genetics and values combine to make forming meaningful connections with other humans effectively impossible. Because I yearn for such connections intensely, it's only rational that this dynamic would make my life unlivable.

I'm not depressed. My brain ain't malfunctioning; it's as valid a pattern as any. The uncaring universe approves of my mind as much as anyone's. I'm just not biologically equipped to thrive in the environments I find myself in."
ds,"Pretending I don't exist is the only way I can feel better...
 I like to pretend that nothing I do affects anybody. I wish that I could just do whatever and not worry about how the world around me is impacted by it, but I know that isn't true. Everybody acts like I don't exist anyway so might as well embrace it. 

 -> Go to school

 -> Be a zombie at school while pretending my feelings don't exist

 -> Don't cry don't cry don't cry...

 -> Fail math

 -> Go home

 -> Pretend everything is just peachy

 -> Apply headphones

 -> Turn volume up to ear killing levels

 -> Try not to worry about the neighbour kids and how they are probably getting abused

 -> Lay down, and now...

 -> I do not exist."
ds,"I’m losing the girl I’ve been with for 7 years and it’s because of my drug use, really bummed
I’ve been with this girl since 9th grade I’m now 23 and I can honestly say I love her with my whole heart. I’ve been abusing drugs of all variety since I was 15, herion, meth, pills, uppers, downers, alcohol, marijuana, research chemicals, it doesn’t matter, but I prefer if it fits into a syringe. I have been to rehab 9 times since I was 15 I’d get sober then relapse sober then relapse sober etc.. I have had legal trouble and been in and out of jail she has been with me through it all, she has always been my better half. No words can explain how blessed I’ve been to have her. This past relapse I was clean for two years before hand and our relationship had never been better we were both happy we both trusted and we both loved no matter what. She helped me get my g.e.d. And she helped me through my grandfathers death (he raised me). I had subtle depression over it I felt like that was normal losing a loved one and all, but I eventually stopped doing the things I was susposed to to maintain my sobriety, I felt like I was cured and no longer needed all the recovery stuff. I was wrong. So one day I decided to take some benzodiazepines and that made me go straight to crystal meth in the time frame of a week I was back shooting meth spending all of my money on it and staying up for days. When on meth I have serious delusions I accused her of cheating on me I actually believed these delusions with my whole heart I felt so betrayed and hurt, I wanted to die. What I feel like really did it was I accused her of cheating on Facebook. Even after multiple people telling me I was wrong I couldn’t believe it, I just KNEW everybody was out to get me especially her, I was very unfair and called her names and called her at all hours of the night, completely out of character of me. After being the good loving boyfriend she knows and loves for two years I suddenly became a monster. I totaled the vehicle I owned and went to jail for possession with intent (Benzodiazepines) possession of marijuana and dui. I sat there for two months (thank god) while I was in there she told me she just couldn’t do this with me anymore and told me she has somebody else in her life, this crushed me. I contemplated suicide while I was in there fought anybody that even remotely rubbed me the wrong way and lost my appetite couldn’t sleep. So I get out and I know that I should just stay away from her because I love her and I don’t want to hinder her pursuing something else, I respected her decision to move on, after all I did publicly humiliate her. So right now I have been sober a month and I feel good in a clear minded healthy way, but I have this hole where she used to be I find myself riding around for hours thinking and crying. I’m very upset that I let this happen, currently I just can’t keep my mind off of her I just want our love and friendship back. I am very depressed and lately I have thought about using again but I would rather kill myself before I do that, I can’t get high anymore I would honestly rather be dead. I’m going to NA meetings, going to church, praying all day, but I can’t seem to ever feel better about losing her no matter what positive things I do. I’d rather be dead then to live without her and I don’t know what else to do."
ds,"isnt it kind of crazy when people who actually are not clinically depressed say they want to die or are depressed for fun, when you are really dealing with those feelings for real?
There are people at my work place who clearly are not clinically depressed but tag and share memes like they are lonely or depressed or just say they want to die in a funny way, when everyday is a huge challenge for me in terms of forcing myself to be alive and conform to the societal norms. This usually never gets to me because many people dont actually get what it means to be depressed. Even depressed people experience things in a spectrum. However, when I feel like I am falling off the wagon and I see these seemingly normal treat suicidal thoughts/coping mechanisms of genuinely depressed people/melancholy as fun memes and have a good laugh when all those things are part my own personal hell, I just go completely bonkers and I do not really know why.

Perhaps due to my meds (some of them have side effects pertaining to increase in appetite and weight gain), and perhaps due to my ridiculous comfort eating, I have become fat. Which is very obvious because I am short and have a small frame. Plus all my tailor made clothes don’t fit me. 

Exercise and the lot don’t work - in fact I’ve exercised 30 minutes or more every day in the last 1.5 month - after all I’m not a young person, I don’t do very strenuous exercise and my metabolism is probably low. So exercise itself can’t burn off the additional calories I’m consuming.

The best way to put it would be I lost my personality. I can really beat myself up sometimes because I hate myself. When something bad happens I really start self loathing quite badly. I don't feel suicidal. I hate myself more than I hate my life. I blame my lack of success on myself. I don't enjoy things as much as I used to so I have no real hobbies. I don't think I'm likable and I can't even pass interviews these days. I lost my personality and that's why I hate myself. I'm unrecognisable to who I used to be so I isolate myself a lot more these days. I don't think significantly depressed but I wonder if mild depression is the cause of my loss of personality?

ds,"Every Day is Exactly the Same. I'm Lonely, Worthless, and Done With Life
Every day, I wake up, go to work, come home, and go to sleep. That's basically it. That's my life. Sure, I have a few friends that I see on the weekends, but it only helps so much.

My ex girlfriend broke up with me and moved out of our apartment 6 months ago now. The almost three years we were together were the only time in my life where my depression was pretty much nonexistent. When she came home that day and told me she was done, I was floored. I had no idea that she felt the way she did, and she wouldn't even discuss the matter with me.

I've tried meeting other people since then, and I've gone on exactly three dates with one person. That's it. I'm basically invisible to women, and no amount of effort will ever change that. I just have to accept the reality that I hold absolutely no value in a romantic context. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's because my generation is only interested in people who are aesthetically in the top tier, or make the most money. Maybe it's because my generation is eschewing committed relationships in favor of having fuck buddies left and right, whoring themselves out to whoever will get their rocks off, both men and women are at fault for this. I don't think I'm a particularly unattractive guy, and I make a pretty damn good amount of money for my age, but since I'm not in that top 10% of men, I'm just always going to be passed over and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. It's almost like there something inherent to my existence that prevents me from having any intimacy. No matter how much money I make or how much I improve myself, that intrinsic quality of my being will always hold me back. I didn't ask for this, but it's the way things are, so I've pretty much given up completely.

I don't have any plans of offing myself or anything like that. But every day, it gets harder and harder to convince myself that I actually have anything worth living for. The one thought I keep coming back to is how scared my cat would be if I gave her to a shelter or how she'd get by if I were gone. I love my cat, and she doesn't deserve to be put in a situation like that. I feel like she's the only thing keeping me marginally together. The thought of causing her any distress breaks my heart, and one of the big things on my mind all the time is simply making sure she's happy and feels safe.

I feel worthless and frustrated. I wish I understood how to achieve what I want in life and be happy, but I guess that's just not in the cards. I can't wait until the day I die, I'll finally get some goddamn peace and quiet. I'm so tired of feeling broken. I'm so tired of constantly being reminded that there's something wrong with me, like I'm some sort of bastard aberration of what humans are supposed to be. I've struggled with this for 12 years now. I don't know how much more I can take."

ds,"Back pain has brought me to a dark space.
I’ve been struggling with back pain for 2 years now and I’m 17. 

I play soccer (football), and thats all I know, I’ve played my whole life. I don’t have much friends nor other hobbies besides gaming (very mediocre gamer). However, these pass two years have been terrible. Due to my undying love for the sport, I would try to play through the pain. (regret it) Which has only made me worse. I decided my first Summer with back pain that I would not play for a month. Which I achieved with no real results. I passed the time playing Video games. However, the constant sitting probably made my back worse. I played a tournament that same Summer after the month break. 5 games some sort of international tournament. By the end of the tournament my back had gotten so bad I couldn’t bear to move. Despite all this, I somehow got chosen to go to Spain. Few months later I went to Spain at 16, with back pain, played soccer and such but didn’t get noticed. Fast forward to now and I’ve gone a whole season barley playing and still struggle with back pain. Now I’m 17, I’ve gone this whole Summer without much activity just stretching and ab work outs. 

The Summer is almost over and the realization that I haven’t gotten better is  bringing a dark cloud over me. I scream at night out of anger and sadness. I constantly tell myself I want to die(<-Im not sure if this is breaking a rule, sorry in advanced, just tell me and I’ll remove this part), and I cry everyday. 

I do most of those things in private, when no one’s home (excluding the random screaming I do at night). 
I don’t want my mom to worry about me like she does my diagnosed depressed big brother, and also her dealing with my little brother’s life (He’s 7). On top of all that my mom is a single mom and barley has time for her own life and gets sad easily. (The sight of my mom sad deeply pains me inside) I’ve always been the one kid that could take care of himself. She has even told me personally that she is glad that she doesn’t need to worry too much about me (only deals with my back pain, she takes me to rehab). 

I’ve been to the Doctors and have done a MRI, they say its nothing. Just functional.  (Whatever that means...) 

Point is, I’m very sad and I feel like I’m getting worse everyday. I don’t know what to do with my life. The one thing I was good at is now gone. I don’t have any other talents or interest.I feel empty without soccer and I don’t know how to feel it.

TL; DR: I’ve played soccer my whole life, got a back injury two years ago and I still haven’t healed. Doctors say its nothing) As a result, I am very sad but I keep it to myself. I’m not good at anything else."
ds,"How can I be happy if I have no friends?
I'm in my first year of uni and everything has gone to shit. I have friends, but they never want to hang out with me. I ask, and they just ignore my texts or say they're busy. I know everyone is really busy in uni, but I take this so personally. I feel like no one ever wants to be around me. I try so hard to be nice to everyone and it seems like they only return the favor when it benefits them. I try to be my own friend and spend time with myself but eventually it just makes me even more sad. I don't understand why I don't have friends. I've joined clubs and put myself out there and it just doesn't come together. How do I not let this bother me? How can I keep from being lonely when I am so, so alone?"
ds,"Not allowed to feel bad?
I feel like I'm not allowed to feel bad. I'm an unimportant piece of shit and there are so many other people that need help and all the other people are a lot more important than me. I'm not considered as a person, I'm just something to use to pull yourself up. It's like I'm stuck in a swamp and all the people step on me and push me deeper down just to get out themselves. I guess I don't deserve to feel good. Noone will care if I will kill myself. They'll just use another person."
ds,"I don't know what to do with myself anymore.
Last year, I met a wonderful friend online. We began dating in February of 2017 and have been inseparable ever since. However, we both have mental illnesses, for me I have PTSD and depression, and for him ADHD and depression. He's being treated for both, I'm untreated because of my family and our financial situation.

I'm afraid I'm frustrating him. I feel like I'm dragging him down. He's tried to get me to take better care of myself, but it's hard, seeing as we're long distance and I always slip back into my bad habits. I feel like I pissed him off tonight and I never understood why he got frustrated, but now I think I do. No matter what, I didn't really listen or heed his advice, and I'm afraid because of that he's going to decide that I'm unmanageable and he'll leave me. I'm terrified I'm going to make him resent me.

I'm at my wit's end, he's my best friend and I'm very in love with him, but I just don't know how to be better for him. I'm up at 3 in the morning, school tomorrow, crying because I'm afraid of losing the one person who hasn't given up yet. I don't know what to do."
ds,"Do therapy sessions work?
I’m 18F, I’m really unhappy with existing. I constantly feel low, I have no social life or friends, even when I did - I had no interest in going out. I’ve recently gone through a breakup and it’s made everything worse, my heart feels like it can’t take no more. And I’ve got classes everyday which I don’t want to do. I’m just sticking in it for the last 6 months. 

I don’t feel any joy anymore, should I see a GP? Do therapy sessions work? I don’t see what they could tell me that I already know, exercise, go out and do things - talk about how I’m feeling. I’m pretty self aware. 

What are things you’ve done that have worked?"
ds,"How do I stop running away from problems or escape from them?
All I do is pile my problems onto future me and live in the present, staying at home all day being depressed, which is still the 'happiest' that I can be. Inevitably I will have to face the consequences of the stacks of work I've neglected, but is there just some way for me to get out of this loop? I don't know what to do, especially when all I want is to be miserable and depressed until I kill myself. Help"
ds,"Starting antipressants
Hi, I'm a male in my early 30's and going to meet with an intake doctor tomorrow. I will probably wind up on antidepressants, so I have been looking up the side effects, and REALLY don't want to have erectile dysfunction and gain weight. 

Do any males have experience with taking medicine and their effects?"
ds,"Ppl i need help or suicide
 like really idk what to do. I have panic attacks, i am depressed and it is very bad. It lasts for one year..."
ds,"I’m so alone...
I’m almost 20 and I’ve never been in a relationship before. I’ve only been rejected by 4 guys and 2 girls. One of them is my closest friend. He says that if I was a girl he would be with me. This makes me feel like I have to change myself in order to be his. Even then I still don’t think he’ll be with me. I’m in love with him because he’s one of the only people who makes me feel like I matter. I just wonder if I’m even going to have anyone in the future... Dating websites/apps are also out of the question because no one wants to talk to me no matter how hard I try."
ds,"Has anyone been depression free for 5+ years?
I get better then I get much worse, it's a cycle that won't stop. I'm wondering if there any older redditors that had severe depression as a young adult, and are now completely free from it? Depression is almost certainly going to kill me, whether it's the harmful way I cope to stay alive day to day, or more directly if I by some miracle can get my hands on a gun. 

Is there anyone that has been cured and not worries about depression creeping back? How did you do it?"
ds,"Just got kicked again from a whatsapp group
I only asked a question, they always removed me without saying anything"
ds,"Thoughest time of my life, and honestly i cant show it
So i meet this girl for nearly 2 years ago.

I'd say we are probably more then best friends, we are soul friends.

For over a year we talked about me moving to their town, so i can get closer to her, her husband and her kids.

We have literally been talking for nearly  2 years straight.

I understand that she is getting abit tired of me now,

but i just moved 1 week ago

and she has bearly talked to me once.

She is so busy playing video games right now, the only one that really has helped me this past week is  her husband.

I feel i moved so far for nothing, and now its KILLING me.

and since i wont have internet for a while,  im getting bored out of my mind, and my depression is hitting me so hard..

I did confront her about this though, but she keeps saying she is depressed and the only way for her is to play games.

Even tho when i play games, she keeps going to private worlds with friends, and whenever i as for an invite, she ignores it, even tho it pops up a big icon on her face.

My life has been so hard lately, my mom lost her kids in court, other then that, my stepdad made an false accusation of me doing stuff to a child becasuse he is a fucking moron and wanted to ruin my life for fun. (And no, i didnt do anything to a kid just FYI). I won the case but it was ever lasting 3 years..

Other thatn that ive been bullied for 15 years, i've lived alone for since i was 16. 

Aswell im a very VERY jelous guy, so im not gonna deny that, and here is one of the issues with this:

MY EX fucked my life up with cheating on me, and since then i have big trust issues, aswell i tend to get very jelous now when my best friend is getting new friends and seems to have more fun with them then me.

Tho, i know my best friend would never leave me since she wanted me up here anyway, but the jelousy that she is having such a good time with others are ripping my life apart.

The past 5 Months has been depression only, and Honestly if people has gone through as much as me these past 5 months with suicidal thought every day, they would of gone mental.

I have a very strong mind, so it takes alot to take me down mentally, but for some reason, im lost and i dont know what to do. Half of the time i just wanna sit and cry.

Before i was friend with her, i had a depression but it wasnt that bad. I didnt have friends then so i didnt have to go through what i have now,

For some reason i feel like im not designed to have friends, that my life should keep going on the PC without real ""friends"""
ds,"I don't know what to do anymore.
I really don't know what to do anymore. It's just too hard. I try to be positive and act like nothing is bothering me but that doesn't help at all. Everyone says it's supposed to get easier, but it doesn't. 

I've tried reaching out a couple times to talk to someone about it but they really don't want anything to do with me. I don't blame them though, it's not their fault nor are they obligated in any way to be friends with me.

I feel like I'm becoming a bigger burden on those around me. I think I'm just not built for this world. I understand not everyone is, but I'm starting to come to terms with it and I'm getting really close... real close.

I don't know how to cope with any of this and I'm just going to stop trying to. If it happens, it happens. No big deal in the grand scheme of things."
ds,"I try so hard to care for other people. Why does nobody care about me?
I spent hours trying to cheer up my friend a couple days ago about her family issues. I messaged her today about my depression and she ignored me. 

Why? Why am I not good enough? Why do people say they care when they don't? People only like me for what I can give them. When I can give them support and be a good friend they like me. But I'm not good enough to warrant anything in return I guess. I help my friends when they're sad. Why does nobody want to help me?"
ds,"Ideas for sleep?
Hey guys, I’m not sure if I’m depressed, I’ve never been officially diagnosed. However, I feel a sense of deep sadness and fear almost constantly, but I hide it super well. The fear aspect seems to get worse at night, im not afraid of one specific thing it just turns into an overall consuming dread. I want to cry like 80% of nights but I simply can’t. I also want to sleep more than anything in the world, it’s my favourite thing. However, I can’t sleep, no matter how hard I try I normally lie awake for hours and when I do sleep I just wake up like 5-7 times a night. I only want to use sleeping pills as a very very last resort. I try to not use electronics before bed, or to watch something happy, but that feeling of being small and smothered and scared and full of dread is still there. Any ideas on how to make it better?

TL;DR Sleep is elusive, i want to sleep more than anything. Please help."
ds,"Does anyone talk to themselves?
I do all the time. I’m trying to stop."
ds,"This world just isn't for me
I'm scum. Bottom of the barrel. I'm no role model and I don't try to become one. Death is scary but it's the only relief from the burden of having to change."
ds,"Can’t stop crying
This week has been terrible, and next week is not going to be any better. I’ve been crying myself to sleep and then waking up early in the morning, only to cry more. The gross weather is not helping either"
ds,"Anyone else been sad so long that moments of happiness are scary?
I find that when I am happy I get scared and find a way to make myself sad again."
ds,"im so lonely i can hardly stand it anymore
literally all of my friends are getting into relationships and while im genuinely happy for them i want to experience that too. i can feel myself becoming more bitter everyday"
ds,"""You don't have it bad enough""/""You only think about yourself""
Got into a discussion with my SO because of my depression/anxiety. They told me I don’t have it bad enough and if I were worse off I’d get my shit together. So something in me snaps and I admit I’d actually rather be dead (whoops). This leads to them telling me I’m only thinking about myself and asking me how I believe they feel when I tell them I want to die. 

Anyone else got to hear stuff like this?"
ds,"I'm the person everyone refers to when they say ""There's always someone worse.""
Extremely stupid; embarassing myself on a daily basis with my poor IQ and lack of understanding anything.

Lost a VOLUNTEER job because I am an idiot and kept screwing things up, and everybody wanted me gone.

Can't control my own pet dog, in too much trouble.

Financially in a dangerous situation.

Unable to find a single thing in life I'm good at, and therefore enjoy.

Forever single due to my weird nature and orientation.

Losing connection with family members due to my questionable morality.

Cannot find work that will suit my long-term heart and breathing issue.

No motivation to do anything anymore.

Cannot do basic tasks. I can't even lace my shoes properly."
ds,"Help: ruining my University course
Second year student here in a UK university. I hardly tried at all in the first year, got generally bad grades on my coursework, but revised just enough for the exams to get a 2:1, which is second from the best grade. I also had a few weeks of socialising separated by many weeks of pretty much self-imposed (and lack of sleep imposed) loneliness. So at the time I felt terrible, but looking back on it from second year I had some good memories. 

Now I'm missing half the lectures, sometimes I don't even go to the shops to get food for the day and have a terrible diet, miss enormous amounts of sleep, and haven't done any work at all. I'm already failing, and even with resits I have to get a ridiculous mark on my tests this semester to even stand a chance of a worthy final score after the 3rd year is over. I feel like the only thing that's gonna bring me out of the depression is the pride of getting a good grade, but I'm way too pessimistic right now to believe that deep down I can even do it. 

I'm convinced that only 2 friends like me, 1 pities me, and their friends just mock me stealthily. Paid for societies but don't go to any. Feel like a huge disappointment to my family tbh."
ds,"Long text, I just want an audience.
Why haven’t I killed myself yet?

It’s not the title, but a question that lingers on the back of my head every second. It’s a common trend that people live for other people but what do you do when you have no one to live for? I never had anyone to live for. It’s not a huge problem really, its another lingering question or jealousy I have whenever I meet a person. Every single one of them have someone who cares for them, even a stranger would care for them. It makes me feel jealous that no one would care for me or even bother to be nice to me unless I open my mouth and say I have cancer or they knew about any of my situation. People don’t care, they pity me. They realize, then, that I’m a hopeless situation and they can’t help me at all because they really can’t. No one can.
Therapies don’t help. My therapist knows all of my situations are out of my control and he wants me to move forward with my life. It’s not really a bad idea, it’s the smart thing to do especially being someone in my situation. I just don’t know why I can’t. Every single being on the planet wants me to graduate already but my body doesn’t agree with me. It’s always either I’m too sad/ stressed/ depressed/ ashamed/ anxious/ lazy to go to school. Nothing helps. Not even the 30mg of Lexapro helps. My school counsellor is doing the nice “I get it, I understand” approach with me and it makes me feel better but it really does make me feel guilty.

I just don’t understand why are people act so shitty with me? Is it my face? Is it because no one cares and all I have is literally myself? Is it because I’m dying soon? What is it really? I just want to fucking die but I cant just let myself slash my throat or swallow a lot of pills because I’m a coward. I want the easy way out. Why isn’t cancer an instant death? Why aren’t suicide booths similar to futurama a thing? 

I give up. I just want to die. 

P.S. Fuck people who say they’re afraid of rejection because hunty what world do u fucking live in that not one single person has said no to you? 


P.P.S. Fuck you E, I’m sorry I disappointed you that I didn’t die yet even my diagnosis’ average life span is 6 months. Don’t worry, it’s coming. And I surely fucking hope karma is real. It’s fucking people like you who deserve such things and what do you fucking get? A nice family, a handsome face, people who likes to be around you. You’re one of the people who deserve my revenge and yet I’m being like a pussy who is letting a fake thing called “karma” take care of everything. In this fucking lifetime, not a single one got any karma. (or maybe my parents did by god giving me cancer but idk they just labelled me as a liability and now has dropped me like a hot potato so that’s really more on me than on them)


PLEAAAAAAAAAAAASE I just want to die. Please just kill me."
ds,"I Empathize More With the Dead Than I Feel Bad for the Living
There have been a few times in the past few years where I found out someone I went to high school with died of whatever means. But within the past few months, whenever I found out someone died, I didn't really feel bad for their family, I mostly was kind of jealous that they were gone and I was still here.

For example, my mom manages a nursing floor at a hospital. She told me one of her nurse's daughters died of a deadly disease at 20. And all I could think about was at 21 all I could think was how jealous I was of the deceased young woman, and how lucky she was. No ill will to her, I hope she rests in peace and that her family is coping.

Another example. When I was in high school, someone I knew had an older brother than went out drinking one night and when he came home, he died, choking on his own vomit.

Again, I feel like there should be a lot of cautionary tales in this, but mostly I just wish I was the one that was dead."
ds,"Fuck you for being happy around me
Goddamn it, I can't even think straight. I hate the people who make me happy because they choose not to. I'm completely alone, and the worst thimg was thinking for a day or two that wouldn't last forever.

Except I am."

I cant really get to sleep at all and have been doing alot of thinking. I just realised that i am in control. The thought of this makes me really happy. I am smiling ear to ear.

ds,"So I graduated but fucked up my exams so bad that my u ivesorty rescinded their offer of admission.
I've thrown up 4 times in the past hour after reading their email. I want to die so bad I'm sitting in the bathroom floor. Why the fuck am I so dumb. I did perfectly fine in school but I decided to get depressed in the final year and fuck it all up.

I'm gonna throw up again I feel so fucking sick."

What daily tasks or activities do you still find happiness in? Please list a few. I'm hoping maybe i can steal some of yours and find some happiness in them as well.  Thank u!

ds,"I am always wrong..
I got married with a wrong man.  I have been married for 5 years. I have a baby who is still a month. I realized that i chose the wrong person as husband. He ruined my life. He ruined my inside. He cheats on me while i was pregnant. But he does not think he did bad things to me. When i said something, he always says that I'm stupid or crazy. He thinks he's right. Since last year, we moved to his country and living with his mother and sister. Because he works there.
His family are nice to me. But my husband doesn't come back every day.. I have a baby but he doesn't support me. I haven't realized he's such a bad man.. He has hidden so many things from me.. So i thought he's a good husband. But he brought financial issues. And i have helped it. But he forgot that.. I want to leave him but i don't have money and i have a baby.. And I'm in different country.. No one is by my side. I cut myself almost every day. I have stopped it since i was 20. But situations make me do that. I would never wear short sleeve again. Too much scars. But i don't regret to cut myself. Because that's the only way to make me live. Maybe people say easy that i should get a divorce or just leave him or ask my family. But that's not easy.  I have tried to end my life many times after i moved here. But I'm failed. I hope one day i can be gone. Life is so unfair. I don't want to live this life anymore. I want someone to kill me.."

Anyone else immediately try to go back to sleep as they are conscious? I'm like ""no, Not this fucking shit agin"" sleep is the only relief I get but that's obviously not sustainable. I really don't know what to do anymore, don't even know how I'm alive at this point."

I started about a week ago and was having some reflux beforehand but only really when I drank alcohol or had something really acidic. Now I’m avoiding all that and I still have issues everyday. I know heartburn is a side effect but the weird thing is that I take it right in the morning and then at fine all day until the evening while I’m getting ready to go to bed I’m just hit with bad nausea out of no where. I avoid eating before bed as well. 

Wondering if anyone else has this experience. I was maybe thinking of moving it to type evening but then I’m worried if there’s some 12 hour delay to it I’m just gunna wake up with the nausea which could be just as bad but at least it won’t effect my sleep. 

Or maybe it will just go away with time since I’m still pretty early on idk but it’s really fucking with me right now"
ds,"Went to a therapy centre for the first time today
I hesitated so much before going, I almost went back too many times. I actually got the address wrong the first time and knocked the door on a young lady asking her if she’s the therapist at the address that I have. Anyway, I’ve filled out the forms and I’m waiting to be contacted by the centre, it’s scary and weird."
ds,"Am I the only one who believes in fantasies and lies to cope with not killing myself?
I believe that one day, the girl I like will like me back. I believe that she will reconsider rejecting me, and apologize to me and we can be in a relationship as more than good friends.

I believe that I will be prepared for my career when I leave college. I believe that I will find an internship this summer and every summer after that. I believe that I will impress employers with my fantastic resume.

I believe that I will make lots of good everlasting friends in college and that I will make even more friends at my workplace in the next three years. The relationships with my high school friends will only strengthen and we will be a group for decades to come. I believe all of the people I know now.

I believe that I will graduate in the next three years, and that I will be able to get As in my classes to increase my GPA. I believe I can graduate with honors, I believe that I will have enough money saved to actually visit Japan.

I believe all of these things because I know I'm a failure at life, and I know I'm not ""built"" to survive and dwell in this world. One day, I will end my life just when my fantasies can no longer be maintained."

My depression has gotten really bad over the last 2 years, and today I realized something. I don't have anyone. Everyone I talk to, people I'd call 'friends' don't really care. They only notice me when I'm the one who talks first. I make plans with them, set up so much and help everyone around me, but none of them care. I skipped school to see what would happen, and nothing. No one even noticed. My parents hate me, and I'm alone. None of this really matters, and no one cares. I'm just so tired, and I want it all to just end.

This isn't gonna be what you think it's gonna be.

If you read the title you're probably thinking my father was the reason of my issues. He was not, I loved him very dearly. I am extremely sad he passed away while I'm in such a young age (I'm 21) but c'est la vie I guess..

The reason I'm now less likely to commit suicide is actually I won't / can't do this to my mother. We had to plan and pay for the funereal and oh my days it's expensive. Already we were on the line of poverty, and this didn't quite help.
I just can't do it to my mother to spend even more money that she doesn't really have. So now the feeling of guilt 'if' I were to do it is bigger than my misery.

Now I just slate the days away, it's hard, but there's no other option for me right now.."
ds,"I'm sorry for the life I chose, I just want another chance
I regret every decision I've made in my life, like to list the off not in order of reason or value to me but just randomly. I have really bad teeth because I just drunk alot of fizzy drinks and didn't take care of them. Secondly this was because of that but I because shy and anxious all the time thinking about what people thought of me. So didn't make many friends in school. Then during school my attention gravitated towards video games and my grades became shit. Therefore felt like university wasn't an option for me. I was taking to this girl I liked and she didn't seem to bothered about my appearance more my personality but she was interested in someone else. I got really attached to her and ended up losing her and a good friend because I became too attached. I regret all of this 10 times over if I could relive my live I would regardless of the emotional scares and events that I went through"

so my ex who I miss like a lot and who moved away because she hated me so much is apparently coming back next year and...

I just want to die. I really just want to kill myself this summer or at least move away.

I don't think I can handle that.

I just don't want to live anymore it's killing me why does she have to come back why can't she just let me be alone and forget that I ever wasn't

aaaaahhhhhhhhh

now I'm going to have to look over my fucking shoulder every five seconds when I'm in the hallways and just fuck me straight to hell if we end up having any classes together I can't fucking stand myself so I know she can't aaahhh

I don't want to make her angry but I know just my presence in general will fuck

I dunno I finally got people to forget about it and stop asking about what happened and I don't want it to start again I just wish I could forget everything or die 

I wish we could both forget and not know each other I think she'd be a lot happier she used to say she was happy she knew me but now knowing me makes her absolutely miserable and I think she'd be a lot happier overall if she never did.

I hope I die I can't handle this well I don't want to I'm so fucking pathetic I hope I die she does too so I should I'm sooooo tired I just want to die I don't think I can stand seeing her face in the halls every day again I just can't"

ds,"Still recovering from ex-girlfriend
To preface this, I’m sure anyone who reads this has seen something similar on this sub a million times already. This is long and the last three paragraphs are my main point, the rest is just an explanation of my previous relationship.

A little over a year ago my ex and I finally split after a long year and a half of on and offs filled with tons of emotional abuse. It was mainly her abusing me at first, getting angry for not texting her quickly enough, coming at my neck for hanging out with friends everynight ( I assume was because she stayed home all the time) and so on. The last couple times we dated she was always angry with me for cheating (which I never did) later to find out she was the one cheating on me. I was extremely depressed once we finally cut ties that I went back and talked to her and then she told me she cheated in detail so she could bring me down more.

After the breakup I ended up getting sick and after a couple months couldn’t even bring myself to take care of myself. Small stuff like wearing my retainer and showering before 5pm was the hardest part of my day. I know that seems small but it plays into how I feel now.

3 months after the breakup I started talking to a friend I met through my ex (however they were not and still aren’t friends anymore) and we’ve been happily together for almost a year now. There was a lot of useless drama with my ex about this which has been resolved but she still tries to harass me and my girlfriend. Last month she texted my phone from her friends number trying to harass me and it was just ridiculous. 

Unfortunately I have to see her in May for my girlfriend’s prom, they are in the same senior class and I an currently a college sophomore. I still feel as though I am in a rough place and don’t physically look as good as I should. Stuff such as my teeth and acne and other results of that loss of hygeine that I still struggle with makes me feel like I have been doing worse than her, which I know shouldn’t matter but it still bothers me. I’ve tried getting my old habits back which work for a month and then I lose track again.

I guess my overall issue is I compare myself how I was when with her to where I am now, mostly with my appearance. I’m also still very depressed and feel that it puts me below her now. My only real win is that I’ve nearly kicked my drug addiction (mainly weed, I was using it to runaway from my problems) but now I can’t seem too kick my other habits of nicotine addiction and taking any kind of pill or cough syrup just to not be sober. I’ve distanced myself from friends and I simply feel lost and useless to the world. In college I can’t make new friends and just sit in my dorm room wishing I could go back and start over so I could be healthier than I am now.

I’m looking for advice or anyone to be straightforward with me on any aspect of my situation. Thank you to anyone who reads this and responds!"

I was molested when I was 5. I'm 27 now and I've never actually tried to deal with it. I just ignored it, but that doesn't seem to be working anymore. I feel terrified all the time.

ds,"My Boyfriend Talks Daily About Suicide -- Won't Go To Hospital
Hi guys, I'm really just at a loss for what to do. I am absolutely gutted.

My boyfriend has pretty serious depression and is in dire need of help. I won't be able to get him in to see a therapist until next week. He has recently become quite down on his luck and he hates himself for it. His anxiety stopped him from going to work, and he was fired. He has a new job now, but he hates it as it is a factory job where he works 60 hrs/week.

 Any time I try to help him find a new job so he can leave this job, he completely panics and shuts down and I can't say anything or else he yells. It has gotten so bad recently that I dread waking up in the morning because of the psychological warfare with him. He will do things like saying he wants to self-harm, or he is going to jump out of the car while I am driving.

I have been with him for years, through thick and thin. I have had to bring him to the hospital before, and he did get better for a few months. He told me tonight he doesn't want me to pick him up from work, and that he wasn't going to come home. At this point I feel completely lost, and I know calling the police won't help.

I feel trapped and I need to get out for my own health, but I am deathly terrified he is going to kill himself if I leave. He told me I am the only thing holding him back from killing himself. I'm scared. He is such a good person when he isn't feeling this constant depression. I don't know how to get him to understand we just want to help him. He shuts me down every single day, and it hurts knowing he has given up on himself. 

What can I do to help him until he can see his therapist next week? I want to leave but I am so scared he will kill himself if I do."
ds,"Anyone depressed in spite of good life circumstances?
A lot of people here are depressed for very good reasons. I really don't have any. I'm pretty happy with my life set up (of course there are some things I'd change but on the whole it's good).

I just have this endogenous, chemical depression that's as bad as being in physical pain. I've been on so many meds in the past and they don't seem to work for me anymore. I run distance every single day and eat well.

I'm facing the very real possibility of total failure.

I’m also anxious, I don’t really know why. I just started a new subreddit, it makes me anxious thinking about it. Maybe I should remove it. Oh well.

ds,"I've been in a constant rush to try and get on my feet for the last three years, but I always end up doing nothing about it. I've forgotten what motivation is all about.

Hey there, I just turned 22. And this is my situation:

About three years ago, I used to feel excited about everything. Finishing school, starting my studies at a university, being self-sufficient, finally doing what I thought was my future career.

I'm not sure what happened, but I started losing my drive. Things didn't look as exciting, nor entertaining. Never having even kissed a girl, I felt alone and loveless. Still, I felt motivated enough to start working on my social skills, met a few people over the Internet, even got a girlfriend. (Thanks to the Internet I have a social life, as ironic as that sounds, even though it's not that good).

Fast forward to this year, I was able to date a couple more girls, had a good time but they all ended too soon. I've never been able to have sex with the girls I've been with because I lost my sex drive in the course of these last years. Also the extremely low self esteem and self hatred don't help.
Today, I find myself unable to even have a conversation with someone, mostly girls. I can't come up with anything to talk about and I feel like all the things I learned about social skills have gone away suddenly. How do people have such natural conversations with one another? How did I manage to do it before? I feel like I want new friends, I want to have a good time, but can't figure out where to go, or what to do to achieve that.
Regarding my studies, this year was a slow one. In the time I should have completed 50% of my career, I only completed around 20%. I started visiting a psychologist because I can't get myself to study for my exams (I'm not cooperating much with him), and all I do is worry about it though I never take up the responsibility.
 
I am fully aware of the fact that things don't come if you just sit and wait, but I can't bring myself to do anything other than complain. Meanwhile I feel like my mind wants to run, but doesn't know which way to go, and my body won't budge. I think 24/7 about how I'm getting older, and I'm wasting every second of my life. I'm completely lost and feel like everything I do is going nowhere. And I don't even know how to end this post, just wanted to put this somewhere and hopefully get some solutions or words of encouragement from people who've been through the same. Sorry for the long read."

At dinner, they were making jokes about how I'm not gonna graduate and how I'm not gonna get a job. My mom knows about my depression and even my past suicide attempt and self-harm. She just decides to brush it under the rug and act like it doesn't exist. I tell her how I am trying my hardest and how I gave it my all and she is just thinking that I am lazy. This is all bullshit.

I don't know if I'm depressed or just the good 'ol sad. I can't fully express how I feel because the inside of my head is a mess. 

I don't want to give what I feel everyday the label of ""depression"", I feel like it just insults the people who knows they have depression. I have no idea where to get any help for whatever I feel. If I did, I would either be too lazy or too shy to ask. 

I am too lazy. Everything is just too tedious. In everything I do, halfway through it I just feel an intense urge to give up, and I do. I can't find a proper hobby to distract myself from whatever's inside my head. 

I can't focus. It is so hard to focus on anything. I just stared at the blinking blue bar for 5 minutes just to type this unecessary sentence, because I lost whatever I wanted to write here in the maelstrom of thoughts inside my head. 

I used to be smart, or atleast feel smart. Lately I feel like I've dumbed down. Questions that I used to answer easily became hard for me. English, something I was proud of for learning it by myself, became harder for me. My memory isn't what it used to be. 

I'm jealous of other people who can properly comfort their depressed loved ones. Everytime, it pains me that I can't find anything in my head or say anything to make them feel atleast a little better. It eats me inside that I know they're suffering and I can't make them feel that someone cares when they think that no-one does. 

I am a fake.

This affects me in ways like not being productive at all when I get close to deadlines, not being to emotionally relate to anyone because my internet sense of judgement and risk management are fucked up, I have self destructive tendencies that I use as coping mechanisms, I hop on the rollercoaster of life and hope and pray sometimes that it would fling me off the tracks.

So I let my kid watch too much tv, let my husband play all the video games, so i could do my stuff with out being bothered as well. Let me also say, I didnt plant my kid in front of the tv for hours on end, but I have to shower, and keep up with the house because man colds are much more sever (no...). Now that were better his behaviors have continued, even though i have spoke to him many times; things wont be like this when were not longer sick. My kid isn't a tv kid and I plan to keep it that way as long as I can.. but he.. he doesn't want to spend time with me any more, just step away from electronics and just chill and talk and play with our kid together... so I wanted to talk to my friends or even my mom... and I realized I don't have very many friends. 

EDIT: I don't care about this getting up votes or anything but sharing it makes me feel a little less lonely.. also sorry for any spelling grammatical errors im usually obsessive but i feel like shit

ds,"I feel trapped in a life I don't want to live.
It took a lot of time for me to consider posting here but I'm gonna be alone for the whole day and can't deal with it. So, hi, I'm just your typical British kid dealing with the stresses of College but the problem is that I'm not stressed because of college (I don't really care much for it but it's better then work), I'm stressed because of this constant cycle of: wake up, spend an hour trying to get up, be 20 minutes late to everything every day, eat, browse the Internet and sleep. 

All around me there's people who have clear career paths and know what they're passionate about, but I look at myself and realise that I don't have that. I have no interest in working in a job for the next 45 years of my life because there's nothing that I'd like doing. I'm doing fine in all of my classes (As in History and Cs in Maths, Distinctions in BTEC Engineering, everything just feels too simple) but I just still get these weeks where I feel worthless and pointless. I get brain fog, I end up teary eyed and can't talk to anybody for fear of looking stupid (I have speech problems). But then when I end up actually talking to others I apparently look happy.

I have spoken to people at my school about it, but it's the same thing every time. 'Oh you're struggling? We'll have a five minute conversation about your feelings and wait months to make sure you're not still sad'. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I stopped taking medication in July 2017 and haven't seen a doctor or therapist since. They didn't help, the medication I was on turned me into a god damn zombie and my therapist got exceptionally pissy at me for not telling the truth about my lack of improvement. I felt like I had to lie so I didn't waste their time and mine, I worry that's why I end up wearing a mask 90% of the time. Even around my family, who believe more in self-help then actually getting an actually decent therapist to try and help me. I'm ashamed to talk to them about it, no matter what anyone says, trust me when I say that they will NOT understand. I have been incredibly clear about it all and got mocked for it, some people just don't want to learn.

I had a pretty bad childhood that I try to justify my problems with (dealt with a lot of sexual abuse and my mother died in 2013) but when I'm having these 'days' I'm not thinking about anything in particular that would make me flighty. I ended up admitting a lot of my past to one teacher last week who I admire greatly and whom pretty much just saved my life and I am still cringing today. I know I have no reason to cringe either, I just get so nervous of social interaction.

I just don't get why the universe picked me to be its miserable little experiment. I never asked for anything bad to happen, I never asked to constantly feel tired and under the weather, I know that life isn't gonna be perfect but why is it that day after dull ass day I have to feel worse and worse? I try to take responsibility for my health, I feel like dirt, I have other people have some part in it and they take it for granted and hardly any of them actually make a big effort on me. 

Sorry if my words are jumbled and rambled, I just needed a place to vent whilst I still can."

I have such a hard time saying no to people and I just try to make shit work because I get scared of losing them. It's never really the same after you've dated or tried to be more then friends.

ds,"I’m working on a new app/startup to help you guys. Please read this, I would really appreciate any help/feedback.
Hello everyone! I’m a current sophomore in college studying Computer Science and this summer I decided to work on a new app that caters to depressed/suicidal people who are going through bad times. I want this app to connect depressed users to people who are volunteers at crisis centers or just regular people in general that are willing to devote their time to helping the users. This app will be similar to twitch where the volunteer will go live (and you can see their face) and any user can instantly connect with them. First, the user will enter their information like: what their favorite tv shows/movies/music artists are, where they’re from, and what type of gender they’d feel most comfortable talking to. All this information gathered will be used to connect the user with a volunteer that closely fits those preferences (the user can swipe through all of the options that are given to them and they can actually add these volunteers to a list that they’d like to come back to). I want it to be a one on one session where the user can decide to turn his/her camera on, or if not, just use the microphone, or if they don’t want to do either of those options, they can just use the chat box provided. I want it to be a social platform where users can connect with other users and see what they’re doing. Basically a user is becoming friends with their “streamers”/“volunteers” and other users as well. Also, these one-on-one sessions can be changed to a room where there can be 4 users to one volunteer and that way more people can connect with each other with like a “chaperone”. I wouldn’t dare dream of making any money from this app and I know I need funding from VC’s to get this thing skyrocketing. That is why I am getting all the resources I need from my school’s entrepreneurial program and they are going to connect me to the people I need to know. I hate to say it but if I need to make shareholders money, then I’ll do it, but I don’t want to make a single dime off of an idea that caters to people who are struggling through something so drastic. This may sound far fetched but my biggest dream for this app/company, is to have a box filled with goodies being mailed to users when the holidays/Valentine’s Day/ birthdays come around that include: letters/voice messages from volunteers saying “Happy Birthday!” Or “Merry Christmas!” Or “Happy Valentine’s Day!” followed by more messages that has to do with the user. This box will also include a lot more goodies that has to specifically do with the user. 

I used to be like you guys. I can’t say that I suffered as much as you guys but I came to this sub a couple of times when I had no one else to go to. I had no shoulder to cry on in my freshman year of college which is why I think this app could actually mean something to someone. Please, we need to try and put an end to the huge suicide rate among children/adults in America. Please provide any feedback, whether good, bad, or helpful. Anything helps, really. I can also answer any questions you might have about this app. Please excuse my bad grammar, I’m a computer science major for a reason haha."
ds,"I've been reading this subreddit for awhile.
Well, as the title says I have been reading this stuff for months. I think I'm depressed. I'm not sure why though. I have a really good long-term boyfriend, everything I need and a lot of things I just want. I've been ""depressed"" as long as I can remember. I think about killing myself every day, multiple times a day. Like, ""oh, i dropped something, well better kill myself"" ""Oh, I failed that math problem, you're worthless better kill yourself now"" I can barely shower most days. I don't know why my boyfriend hasn't broken up with me. Sometimes I wish he would so I could just kill myself. I feel really bad for him. 

I have anger issues I think, My moods change really fast, it is hard to keep up with them and I don't know why it happens. Most days I don't want to get out of bed. I don't have any friends. I always feel like everyone hates me. 

It would just be so much easier to die, why do people bother with life? What is the point? Everyone has always said that things ""get better"" but they don't really. They change and then something else sucks.

Nothing makes me happy, I don't enjoy doing anything that I can do by myself. I hate being alone, I hate my own company. I guess I just hate myself. Is this depression? Do I just suck? Maybe I'm just being dramatic. 

I wanna be a better person but I don't know how. My anxiety feels like a prison. It's really hard for me to leave the house. I HATE being around people, but I don't want to be alone either. Going to the store is a nightmare for me, the panic attacks and worrying I'm in someones way all the time. I only go in the middle of the night and never by myself. 

What is wrong with me? Why can't I do things normal people do? Is there any point in existing when you always feel miserable? This is the most awkward thing I've done in awhile, Time to take a nap and forget I posted here.

ds,"I finally came out to my close friends that I have depression, and now I'm being alienated because I'm ""not mentally stable""
Probably a rant, but what the fuck.

This last college semester was horrible on me, and I came out of it with depression and depression meds. I'm 19M in college right now. I thought it was pretty obvious, but I wanted to tell my friends about why I've been talking less and have been hermitting myself out a little. So the next time we're all together, I tell them that I have depression and that's why I'm taking meds and that's why I've gotten so quiet, ect. And... Barely any response. Basically just some ""oh, ok..."" Like really? But it get's better.


So the night after I tell them, I get a message from one of my ""friends"", whom I was going to room with next year. The message said, and I can quote, that they ""don't feel safe around a mentally dark person"" in their house. Ok, what? Even better, the convo goes on and says that my group of friends were talking... And they don't want to, in quotes again, ""Associate with a mentally dark person"" as a friend. Like what the fuck? It's been a week and they've lived up to it. Suddenly I'm not getting invited anywhere or anything. If I'm with my friends (I still try to hang out), I'll get heavily ignored. Like what the fuck, my depression has now gotten so much worse.


I want to ditch every single one of them, but I honestly don't have any other close friends outside of this group. I'm trying my best to find new friends, and if that happens, I 'll happily leave these people who consider depression sufferers ""dark and unstable and unsafe"". Just needed to rant

ds,"An Open Letter
Dear you,

It's been three years since we decided to go our separate ways. We both had different goals, desires and aspirations. We were perfect together, but just at the wrong time.

I'm sorry things ended badly. I'm sorry that for months after they spiraled out of control. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry I let you down, your family down. I'm sorry I buckled. I'm sorry I didn't have the experience or the know-how to react to certain situations.

I'm sorry that I made mountains out of molehills. I'm sorry at times I treated you badly, that at times I held you back.

Three years later, we live totally different lives than back then. I got that job. I traveled the world. I went to Italy - twice. I've been to Times Square at midnight, and so have you. I did it all, but by myself. It's not what I wanted. It's not what I envisioned. 

You can't just replace somebody special with another person, and that you were. Special. 

It's been three years. Despite some triumphs and successes, it still feels like I lost a war. An immense failure that didn't personify my persona, it personified myself. 

On the surface, I'm told I seem ambitious, fully ready to attack each day. On the inside, I feel defeated. 

In the end, you found somebody new, which is fine. I chose, whether consciously or unconsciously to stay on a different path. I've tried new women. Many beautiful on the outside, but they aren't you. Oh no, no, no. They all don't have what you had. 

Not even close.

Maybe one day I will end this crusade against myself, against the past. I can't change it, I can't alter the story, I can't lie to myself.

I wish I could tell you I'm sorry. But it wouldn't change anything. For you it's a battle that was fought long ago. For me, I relive it more times than I'd care to admit.

I'm emotionally crippled, distraught, defeated. It's been a long three years. 

I'm ready for it to be over.

I'm sorry.

Yours truly,

Me."
ds,"Aha! moment during therapy
So I've been meeting with a therapist about once a week since October of 2017. It's been really great, and has helped pull me from the brink more than once. 

Background: I'm gay, and was raised Catholic in the 90s. Guess what happened next! 

Spoiler: I was bullied mercilessly. If I wasn't too gay, I was too fat, or too tall, or too weird or too unpopular. You get the gist. It it wasn't my hair, it was my mannerisms; if it wasn't my high voice, it was the dark circles under my eyes. (Gee, what could have caused me to be losing sleep?)

Flash forward to today: 
My therapist guided me through a meditation today that instructed me to visualize and speak to a younger version of myself. I described what I looked like, what characteristics defined me, and how I saw myself. Then I was instructed to, as myself as the adult I've become, speak to that child and tell him what I was feeling. 

I spoke with kindness and compassion and love and respect for that child, and told him everything would be alright. I told him that all of that hatred was wrong, that it was incorrect and that those people who say all those nasty hurtful things, they probably aren't even going to remember saying it, so don't waste your time holding onto it. 

And it got me thinking about all of the baggage I've he'd onto my life. All the glances and side comments and nasty, hateful things. And how I've internalized it, and believed it. 

And that's when the Aha! moment came. 

*All this time, I've been so worried about all the bullying that other people did, I wasn't even thinking about all the bullying I did to myself.* https://media.giphy.com/media/12KiGLydHEdak8/giphy.gif

All this time, *it was me.* Sure, it was other people who planted those seeds, but it was me who perpetuated it, who told myself that they were true. After all, if you say something enough, it might as well be as true as anything else.


So there it is. There's one step. It might just be one step, but it's a step in the right direction. There's my holy shit moment of the day, and I just wanted to share with you all. There is hope. There is progress. There is love. And I hope you all are able to find it."

Worst year of my life. I used to cut myself and alot of other destructive things(i've more or less stopped those things). Things getting worse. Im trying to get better/improve but I just want a way to cope and feel better. Theres no need to suggest anything else. Ive either tried it, wont try it because its not for me, or due to my circumstances cant do it. I thought I could just start drinking again. Atleast until things get better. Im confident that I can stop if/when i need to im just thinking about the health effects. Atleast i'd legitimately be happy while im drunk so i'd rather do that than say cutting myself or od'ing on medication."

Then I also hate being alone like it would just be nice for one day to be hugged all day by a guy. I would feel more relaxed and just forget about so many things."

ds,"Has your family always ignored your problem?
I think the hardest part of being depressed since I was a kid is how absolutely ignored I was/am by my family. My parents split up when I was 5 and my father died when I was 10. My family completely sweeped it under the rug like I was supposed to be completely ok with it and it has never been a topic of discussion at home. I walked around sad, slumbered over, quiet, avoided eye contact and stared into the distance for years and years and no one ever assumed proper to ask if there is something wrong with me. The only time they sent a psychologist my way was when they had to determine who I should live with after divorce. My mother to this day seems absolutely oblivious to my suffering.

I don't ever feel like telling them for they will propably assume I'm ungrateful and spoilt. I've had everything! They sent me to school, fed me, put clothes on my back. What else could I possibly need?

I don't want to burden or blame anyone for what has happened but just I feel so abandoned."
ds,"Helping a girlfriend with depression possibly?
Hello,

I want to first off say this is a throwaway. I also looked for similar post regarding what I will ask, but i really want a tailored answer for my own sanity. Sorry for being selfish, this is just hard. I have been dating this girl for almost a year and I know she has been slipping into an abyss of what I cannot diagnose, but seems like depression. I will start with a time table.

We began dating after meeting on a popular dating app and we hit it off fast. Similar interest, goals, outlooks, expectations, and lifestyle. We became extremely close with in two months and then out of the blue she tells me its over. I didn't feel it was a justifiable way to end the relationship. I contacted her and we had long winded email correspondence with in which she had this quote to me "" I feel lost at work, lost in my personal life, and just lost with trying to find my happiness. You do make me happier. And idk what just snapped last week but I was super depressed all week .""

I talked with her and we set small goals to rekindle and help her find her happiness. We got back together with in two weeks and that started a prolonged honeymoon period for which we traveled, went on ski trips, took our dogs on hikes, and generally enjoyed ourselves.

This continued until march or 2018, when I noticed her slipping back in to her just overall never satisfied state. I got worried and tried to lightly push her to no avail. I then tried to make plans at least twice a month to help distract her and give her a solid thing to look forward to. She never changed and just got worse to the point where the last 2 months, she gets home from work smokes enough weed to put me to sleep, eats too much and then goes to sleep by 9. I tried to encourage by proxy by going to the gym and going to parks with her dog and taking pictures and even getting closer with her family. nothing worked.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, she went to Sweden on a vacation with her best friend and had a blast and was calling me everyday so happy and excited. I thought we had a legitimate break through. Then one week before she returns i start to only get 1 or 2 text a day, I figure she is living her best life to busy with international travel to communicate regularly like she requested.

She returns and we spend one night together and she calls me at school to come over to her place asap. she dumps me with little to no explanation. I met with her once more to voice my opinion and she was just quiet and had nothing to say but sorry and that i deserve someone who loves me like Love her. Today she starts emailing me about how she just needs space and she wants me to still talk to her family.

I really do not know what to think...

My friends say fuck her move on.

I have never had a connection or love for someone outside my family and I have had at least 3 relationships over 2 years (I am almost 30). This one really felt different, the way she looked in my eyes and the way we talked about all our joint desires, just felt so good.

I just want everyone to know I am open to honest responses and please feel free to speak openly, I just hurt because I feel like this is when she needs me most, but also might just need her own time to figure her self out. Thank you for your time and help. 

Cheers,

Your Reddit friend."
ds,"I got laid off but my coworker that stole $1000 didn't.
I was a new sales person at a dealership. I was very sick and went into work. My boss dismissed me because I sick and told me not to come back until I was better.

Later today I got laid off because I didn't text him that I was sick the day after. Which I thought we established that I can't come back to work until I felt better.

Meanwhile the financial manager stole $1000 and the boss didn't fire him.

I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me but I think I might have depression.
1) I love going out with friends. I am very active person, but lately for example even when I am laughin I suddenly stop and get very sad. I do not know what is wrong but I get very sad and I lose interest in doing everything.
2) Lately I can not focus. I have never been fun of doing homework but I was always doing it. Now I just can't I am just laying bad instead of doing homework. You might say I am been lazy but also I am music producer and I absolutely love music, but lately I just can't. When I sit down I just can't focus on it and I end up going to bad after 15 minutes.
3) I am sleepy all the time and I am sad most of the times. I do not have specific reasons but I am.
4) I  became very insecure. It feel like my friend do not like me. I feel like they do not want me to be around them and I just do not know why.
5) Most of the times on weekdays I am just laying on my bad and listening sad music and I feel like I am wasting my time.

ds,"So I finally realized something this week...
Been stuck in an episode since my birthday (just turned 25, as per my last post). Can't remember the last time I ate a proper meal. Sleep cycle is fucked. Haven't left the house in a week. Funny enough, I had planned on hanging out and doing some reading in a cafe today... only to never leave the house. All this time, I've been thinking how much I yearn to have someone, anyone, physically check in. Or a partner to cuddle with, hug, and hold me tight.... but all that just fades into the empty void. 

I used to be Christian, and used to pray. Now that I'm not, I'm realizing how truly alone I am in dealing with all this. My friends all live in the city center. They have jobs and livelihoods. Ultimately, I have to physically do things by myself. No one's gonna save me. It's heartbreaking. Physically, I'm just so alone."

ds,"Advice on dating someone with ADHD
Has anyone dated someone with ADHD? I have depression and anxiety and have been going to therapy and taking antidepressants to try to overcome it. Whenever he becomes inattentive or hyper focused on something else, it makes me feel alone and unwanted.

ds,"I always wanted to go to the therapy but my very huge and overprotective gossip-loving family made this impossible for me to do
Not only that but even a little hypothetical talk about it would instantly gain unnecessary panic like attention and after several phone calls to friends, family members with something like *""Hey Clara, he wants to go to the therapist. Is this normal? Which one should we call? Do you know anyone? Ask John please!""* And next day there will be several people touching my hand and saying ""Hey are you fine?"" Making it feel like something is wrong with me when I just want to talk to a professional in person without feeling like a babe. 

How do I know? Because my sister was depressed once and I've seen how everyone reacted to it. You see, my family's  never changing mentality is ""we need to fight together! We are there for you (goddamn Fairy Tail guild or something)"". I don't blame them and I bet there are people who'd exchange everything only to be with someone as supportive. But I have always hated attention so much since I remember my self as a kid. Ironically enough I've had the biggest birthday parties in the town to boost this 'weird' hate. 

Doing it secretly will be risky because I actually work in my family's business as well so my tight schedule and the fact that my town is pretty small makes this almost impossible. And if someone finds out I secretly go to talk to a doctor it will have even worse reaction than just straight out telling them. 

Maybe I'm overreacting and have too much pride in me or no balls to admit to my family but sometimes I wish I could get invisible for just a week to sort my inner problems out. Sorry If this feels like I'm trying to make it harder for you guys to make some suggestions. It's way more complicated than that I just wanted to let it out. I've read some posts here and some of them were so so dark that my problems actually fade away a bit and I felt better because I said to my self *""yo... you are being a bitch right now, look at these people suffering here, you aren't even close!""* (don't know if I'm being terrible for healing my little wounds by reading how other people suffer).

Hi everyone, my GF of 2 years has been on antidepressants for about 15 months, there is a definite lack of sex drive since then, but I understand that can be a side affect and she's acknowledged it and we've spoke about it. But sex itself is not really the issue. 
There is a distinct lack of affection. We never make out. Or really kiss unless I initiate it. Or hug much. It makes me feel shitty and lonely when I'm consistently the one pulling her in for a hug etc. I've spoken to her about it and she gets defensive and says she gives me plenty of affection and makes it seem like I've got a problem.

I'm just wondering whether anyone has any thoughts on if this is also a side affect or whether lack of affection is completely down to her as an individual?"

ds,"Opened up to a ""friend"" about my depression. It could've gone better.
Hello, Reddit.

I've never posted here before. I'm a bit nervous about sharing this story (I'm very shy, even anonymously), so I want to thank you in advance for taking the time to read it. I'm hoping that just getting it off my chest will help, even if only a little. Also, I'm sorry if this post rambles on a bit or is incoherent at all, I'm not in the best state of mind at the moment.

Earlier today, during our school's lunch break, I opened up to somebody I trusted about my depression and anxiety. I've been on a steep downward spiral recently, and this person had taken notice that something was wrong. She sat me down, grabbed us a couple of sodas, and told me to spill my guts. Normally, I would have simply told her that everything was fine, and made some lame excuse like ""I didn't sleep well last night"" or ""I'm just worried about my exam scores"". But this was the first time that anybody had ever reached out to try and help, so I decided to be truthful. I thanked her for offering to listen, and explained that I had never shared this with anybody else, so I might struggle to fully express myself. She was understanding, and told me to take as much time as I needed. 

I was very careful not to unload everything on her, I basically told her exactly what I said at the start of this post: that I struggle with depression and anxiety, and that it's been getting a lot worse recently. Initially, it seemed like it was going well. She had several follow-up questions, some of which I wasn't entirely comfortable answering. However, for the first time in years I felt a genuine sense of hope, and felt like someone actually cared about me, so I answered them anyway. Eventually, she asked me what was causing all of this. I explained that while there are certainly things that contribute to my depression on a day-to-day basis, at the root of it, there isn't really a reason. It's just who I am, almost as if it's hardwired into my brain. It's hard to explain. Do any of you understand what I'm talking about?

Anyway, this is where things took a turn. While I was trying to explain that, she stopped me and said: ""I'm sorry, I can't do this. I offered to help cause I thought you were just having girl problems, or school problems, or something. I didn't realize you were totally emo. We're not in high school anymore. Besides, you're a guy, just toughen up"". That last part stung. I knew that was a common sentiment in our society, but to hear it coming from her, someone I've been friends with since high school, really took me by surprise. I didn't know what to say, so I didn't say anything. I just kind of looked down at my lap. We sat quietly for a moment, until she got up and started gathering her things. As she started to walk away I said: ""I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable, I wasn't trying to do that."" She looked back at me and said: ""Look, a big reason I'm friends with you is because of your positive attitude. It's infectious, and I love that about you. But if that's really just a mask, then you should probably just keep the mask on if we're going to continue being friends."", and then she left. 

She texted me a few hours later and said: ""I hope you're able to move past your issues so our friendship can move forward"". I haven't responded, and don't plan to. I cry myself to sleep at night enough as it is without also worrying about maintaining a fake personality for her. I probably won't be opening up to anyone like that again anytime soon (except, of course, to all of you wonderful people on the internet). Deep down, I know that most of the people in my life wouldn't react the way she did. But I just don't think I can build up the motivation to try it, not when I struggle just to get up in the morning.

I want to thank you all again. Not just for reading my story, but for being a part of this community. Depression and anxiety really suck, and nobody should have to suffer through them alone.

ds,"I don't know what my problem is
Hello, I've never posted here before. I'm a 28 year old guy and have a decent job that I like, it's quiet and involves a lot of puzzle solving and I'm pretty good at it. I've never had a ton of friends because I'm very particular and not very open with people so it takes a long time to build up relationships, but the friends I do have are outstanding and I wouldn't trade them for anything. I'm kind of the funny guy but my humor is very blue. I got bullied a lot in grade school and learned to make people laugh because it'd get them to not make fun of me. I think it just kind of stuck. I don't know if any of that information is really important, just wanted to give it in case that's something that people do here.  

For at least 5 years, I have a hard time doing anything outside of my job alone without crawling up inside my head. All the things that I used to do for enjoyment like listening to music or playing video games, I just can't do anything anymore. It's like a wave of apathy that very rarely lifts. Occasionally, I pick up a razor blade and will press it into my shoulder or hand and I don't really know why to be honest. I don't know if I like the pain or maybe I like having something else to focus on for a minute. Or just to feel something that isn't apathy for a moment.   

I think about dying sometimes. Why we're here, what's the point if it ends the same. I doubt I'd ever kill myself because there are things I care about here that I wouldn't leave behind like that, mainly my mom and brother. I worry my brother will end up like me.   

Is there anything I can do? I don't know what a pill could do for me or if a pill works. I think the brain is so complex that it couldn't, but I guess I don't know. I don't want to be in a mental fog or be unaware or not be me anymore. I've also always kind of thought that it's human nature to feel this way: that everybody gets down, gets bored, thinks about their mortality, etc. and that I'm just being soft and need to suck it up. Life is difficult, I just need to learn to deal with it maybe.   

I don't know what's going on but I don't like feeling like that. If I'm hanging out with friends or family I'm usually fine, it's being alone with myself and having time alone where I can't entertain myself and waste away. I can't really explain it. Does anyone else feel like this? What helps you? I've never talked to a therapist or anything like that and understand you cannot give a diagnosis on here, but if you know any methods to help me get out of that feeling, I'd be eternally grateful. Is this what depression feels like and I've just been in denial about having it for years?"

Hi everyone. This is my first post on Reddit. I just felt like I needed advice from people who might understand. 

I'm in my early twenties and just graduated with a bachelor degree in psych in October. I never really had a job during that time because I was lucky to have my school and expenses paid for and I wanted to focus on school. I've only had one job but it was 5 years ago just at a fast food place. My boyfriend of almost 4 years and I live together. He has a great job and pays for 2/3 of our expenses and I pay the rest. He's recently told me he doesn't see a future for us if I don't get my life together and find a job and start putting more into the relationship. I feel this is coming at a bad time because ever since I graduated I am really anxious and depressed. I find it hard to even get up in the morning, chores get neglected, I don't even want to get out of the safety of my bed. The world is bleak and I'm sad all the time. I can't sleep all night and then sleep till mid afternoon. I feel like my life is just staying home and having to do chores and feel sad. I try to apply to entry level jobs like cashier at the grocery store but no one calls back.

ds,"Having a really bad stretch of days..
Hi all,

I know this sub moves kinda fast but I just wanted to vent, hopefully some of you read this..

So my story is that I've had depression and social anxiety for about 15 years or so (at least that's when I recall starting to feel ""off"".. I'm 29 now).. Because of my poor decision to bottle things up and accept that I'm unhappy I put off seeking help until about a month or two ago in which I started going to therapy. It had taken a rather bad mental fallout that occurred in early December for me to finally reach out for help.

In my sessions we've been working on techniques to combat both my SA and depression, these include going to places alone such as coffee shops, yoga classes, shopping malls, etc. (Keep in mind I have ""functioning"" social anxiety where I can physically be around people but I'm extremely uncomfortable the entire time and have a very difficult time interacting with people).. The thought process being that my depression stems from loneliness and my SA contributes to that.. It's been a big step for me to try and go out on my own, but I've been doing it almost every day even though it doesn't seem to be creating any improvement.

Unfortunately the last few days have been incredibly difficult, I'm getting a very sick feeling of hopelessness and worry that my life is now just constantly shuffling around desperately trying to find something in the world that will ""fix"" me. I tried to sit at home last night to give myself a break and I couldn't even do that, I started becoming consumed by those bad thoughts and began having a panic attack.. So I decided to just go drive aimlessly even though we were in the middle of a snow storm..

I feel miserable again today and I'm just running out of steam to keep going, I really don't know what to do anymore.. I'm exhausted from constantly forcing myself into uncomfortable public situations but at the same time my home feels like a prison.. I have nobody to talk to or gain support from anymore, the couple of friends that I have all have their own lives with wives and kids and my family has been out of my life for 10 years and for good reason.. I know nobody has answers as to what I should do but I just needed to rant"

I know people who I used to be friends with but now we are just accquantences, we don’t talk at all but follow each other on social media. But here’s the thing, when you post things on social media about how you are ready to kill your self or how depressed you are and you don’t even get a text asking if you’re okay- does that mean no one cares? I see them caring about other people but they never seen to make sure if I’m okay. I mean I don’t expect them to, but I know when I see people that I care about talking like that I need to make sure that they’re okay. I mean, how can you say you’re friends with someone but not even say anything when they’re threatening to kill the selves. It’s weird, you’ll be Sauk g how much you want to die and how depressed you are and no one will say anything BUT they’ll make sure to send you a picture on Snapchat to keep the streak lol. Worthy enough for a number on Snapchat but not worthy enough to live in their eyes

ds,"Going to bed in the morning, waking up at night.
For about a year now, I've been going to sleep in the morning when the rest of my family is getting ready to start their day and getting out of bed in the evening/night.

It started because I transferred to online school and I thought it would be fine to stay up until 3 am or so, but it's gradually gotten worse and worse and as I'm typing this it's 9 am and I'm just now getting ready to sleep. I'm guessing I'll wake up at about 3 pm and actually get out of bed at 4.

It's really screwing with my coursework and making my mental and physical health worse. People keep giving me reasonable advice like turning off distractions and forcing myself to go to bed, or even staying up the whole day so I'm very tired by nighttime, but I just can't find the willpower to go to sleep or get up. I'm not motivated to do anything anymore that I don't have to do. I'm starting to feel like a complete failure.

Has anyone else experienced this or is experiencing it?

I have no plans for my future, I am overall retarded In school. All I can do is be an escapist by playing video games, watching videos, eating unhealthy food, and all i do is isolate myself from reality... My therapist is overall useless, all she does is repeat the same shit I hear from people...

But most times I am left on ""read"" or get lukewarm responses, as though they are annoyed. They don't really initiate conversation with me and rarely ask me how I'm doing.

ds,"Feeling trapped in my head
First off I'm Autistic, I'm studying at Oxford I'm struggling to remember anything, like anything at all, people, faces, dates, facts, etc. I'm feeling more and more alone because I don't feel like I have anything good to think about. I have a girlfriend, she's in the forces and has a lot of structure and meaning to her life and I like that but I see my life as completely pointless.  

So about a year I was cycling in the dark and I was hit by a car, I flew over the bonnet and hit my head. I was out for about half an hour, till I regained conscience in the back of an ambulance, and the crews were cutting off my clothes and pumping me full of morphine. Before this accident I had a very good memory, and my parent would say I could talk about anything that had happened from when I was a child. I was having some weird relationships at the time with different people, and I only came out to them after I was in hospital for a month after the accident, I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to worry them. I valued their feeling more over my own life, and I still do that now with other people. 

Things started to crash after the accident, I lost people really good friends and I knew it was me, and I changed and something during that accident had altered me, and I hated it. I started to forget people very quickly and events that had happened and horribly people who had died and continuously not realising they had died. That upset a lot of people. Before everything happened I had broken up with a girl (but i didn't realise that after), now I can't remember what we did together or even how we met, but I can't get the thought of her out my head, she later told me to leave never come back, which I did. But even now I still have the feeling of thought of her, and I'm struggling to get rid of that, I don't love her and I'm not in love her, I just feel like i'm obsessed with her a person I know nothing about and It haunts me. 

I've been to a few separate doctors and have been recommended medication, which I believe it has just made it worse. I've talk to my parents but they just talk highly of the pro's of medication and councillors. Hate councillors. (I always ended up lying to them) 

Since everything I've had some real down point, and made two attempts, by failed due to people walking in randomly either whilst in progress or while setting up. I've already made necessary precautions by writing letters, addressing them and stamping them but non have been sent. I want to tell my gf but I feel like, I don't want to throw feelings away by her thinking 'he's a sobbing kid, or he's crazy or why am I with him' - I'd rather hide it not to upset her, people mean everything in the world to me, and I'd give my life for her, any day. But I still want to tell her, and I don't her to be scared of me. 

When I close my eyes and think of a memory, I just see grey mist or static like of a television. It doesn't feel nice not having anything to fall back on in your mind, things that made you happy."

I've always wanted my mom's approval, I want it so badly, I want her to turn to me and say she is proud of me..but since I was a kid she always got my hopes up, she always left me to chase after her next boyfriend.

The day she left my dad I ran after her car...I don't remember how young I was. I hated her for a long time...I still kinda do.

I’m really not sure what I’m tryin to say. Other then... I’m just not sure if I want to continue this life anymore. But I can’t kill myself. I lost my mom about a year ago. Well she’s alive... just not the same. She was in a motorcycle wreck, and she’s a totally new person. I can’t even stand to be around her. We were best friends. And now I don’t even have her.

Hey all. Just need to talk, really struggling right now and trying to dig out of it. Not really sure what else to do.


Pattern of behaviour:

Wake up in the morning with immediate feelings of depression and loneliness. Acute feelings of being alone in bed, uncomfortable. Become compelled to flip through Bumble, Tinder because I feel a need to try and immediately correct the problem. I never (and I mean never) match. Have to fight urges to immediately abuse addictions like porn and weed. Sometimes do, sometimes don’t.
Prepare for work, fight off feelings of sadness about ex-girlfriend and situation it puts me in. Fight the urge to blame her for the failure of the relationship even though I logically know I’m wrong or that’s not fair. She just left to pursue school and had to move on, she didn’t do anything to me. Fight feelings of rejection and feelings of inadequacy in my value to others even though there’s no reason to feel that here.


Walk to work, continue to fight with anger issues re: relationships and validation. Sometimes frustration stems from lack of work success but more often than not it’s physical appearance issues and relationship issues. I get caught in a loop being mad at her and being mad at myself and my capacity to deal with being alone.


Auto-pilot at work. Able to do job easily, so lack of focus is a non-issue. I spend too much time on Facebook and other social media looking for outlets to expand my social network and friends. Find it very difficult to do so without appearing over-anxious or creepy and new opportunities rarely prevent themselves. Sometimes  Imarket business and contact clients/potential clients. Sometimes a boost comes from having success here, but often the lack thereof is equally esteem damaging.


Go home, usually bus. Already tired. Immediately engage addictions, usually beer and weed. Start watching TV or playing games and rarely stop until bed time. I'll leave easy tasks like cleaning dishes, etc for weeks. Continual evasion of solving problems, instead opting to rely on substances to either forget or balance my feelings of sadness. Occasionally I have friends over, but many of them use substances as well or are in similar life situations so finding solace in these encounters is limited. Furthermore, they are my friends of many years and represent a kind of social stagnation.


At night I’m usually in bed by 10, not because I’m out of things to do, but because I’m either drunk or bored.


On weekends I’m lucky if I do anything outside of what I do immediately after work. I rarely feel compelled to do anything. If I get invited to a bar, I end up going and feeling alienated from everyone and ‘out-of-place’. Most of the time, I just feel too tired to join my friends, but I also feel a lack of motivation because I’m sure it’ll just be the same crowd—and it appears their lives keep moving while mine does not.

I am behind on adulthood. I have only recently acquired a driver’s license, I just renewed my glasses prescription and only just started living on my own. I have to get my teeth taken care of and they are a source of stress and physical pain (still have wisdom teeth at 34). I have the habits of a teenager. I smoke copious amounts of weed, I drink daily and I don’t pursue my interests or goals. I know the right course of action most of the time, but I actively ignore it because the amount required to get healthy is just too much. I have spent a great majority of my life single and most of my relationships aside from a few gems have been tumultuous, emotional rollercoasters. More often than not, 
Despite all these things I feel undervalued in my society. I think of myself as smart, funny and confident in my skills, but I feel that the rest of the world doesn’t care and doesn’t see those as appealing. I feel like without looks and an academic education, you can only accomplish so much and that people’s standards are so high that competition for a good role in society is unlikely. I feel unable to compete when the above issues prevent me from succeeding. Motivation to do anything is lowered by the lack of acceptance in general, the feeling that I should be acceptable the way I am but am not, and my inability to seem to control that situation. It doesn’t help that on the face of it, most people will tell me that I seem like a “catch”, an incredibly high-value person with lots to offer—except that none of that seems to translate to my life, emotional attachments or stability.

I'm just lost."

I really can’t even remember the last time I showered, and it’s not even me enjoying being a nasty bitch I just  don’t want to? I mean, I don’t like feeling dirty or like I smell bad, but the thought of getting in the shower, bathing, washing my face, getting out, putting lotion on , etc. just sounds like to much work. The most I can do is brush my teeth, but other than that I lay in bed. 

I mean I can get up to do things that I like on a good day like painting, but for the most part I lay in bed all day. I don’t want to feel like a nasty bitch of that I’m an “unkempt” girl but at the same time I feel like I can’t help it. I also don’t want to feel like I’m using this as an excuse to be nasty but I just can’t.

ds,"It's hard to keep standing up, keep fighting, and get down each time. I just want it to end
I’m done. Hard work doesn’t pay off. Ever since I was 14 I felt depressed and like I’m not good enough. I felt like it was my own fault that I felt so sad and angry and that I wasn’t good enough for other people. One day I decided that if it we’re my own fault I felt that way then I could also improve my situation. Al my negative emotions went into working hard. 

I finished my studies (not by working hard, but because I was good at it) and put all negative emotions into working out. I got accepted into a difficult job at the Army. Now I quit the Army because of an injury in my knees. At the same time I lost a girl, even though we only went on one date, I thought she could be the one positive thing to take from the Army and all the hard work I put in to get into the Army. 

So what’s my situation now? Jobless, girls still despise me, have a degree with which I can’t find a job with and all the work I put into improving my situation was for nothing. 

While trying to improvie myself and during my studies and time at the Army I still had periods where I felt very down. It just becomes harder and harder and harder to crawl out of it every time. The negative voices and feelings are too much and getting up to fight just becomes impossible.

I had the power once to get up and try to fight. Now I don’t even have the power to suicide. But I just wish it was all over. 

Eventhough it feels useless I might go to a psychologist. How has it helped you guys? I wan’t to end it all but I don’t want to end it all. I don’t know. I feel lost and sinking deeper every damn time."

Do you ever get tired of saying you're okay when you're not but you don't want to talk about it? So instead you just stop talking to them but then you feel worse for alienating your family and they have no idea why or what's going on with you. 

My family has never been super close. We get along with each other and talk to each other but we're not a support system and I don't feel comfortable talking to them about my problems. I feel like I'll be judged and gossiped about so I just keep it to myself and as a result wind up pushing them all away. 

The only person in this world I feel I can talk to about my problems are my husband and I know that's a huge burden on him to be my only outlet, my only friend. It's putting a strain on our relationship and I blame myself for this. It's a lot of pressure to put on someone. Living with a person with depression is hard enough under normal circumstances (whatever normal is) but add the burden of being the only friend, the only person that knows, the only person period.

Hey guys. This is my first post here, I made this account because I need to vent and I have no one else to listen to me. To an outsider, my life seems okay: I am married to a great guy, I have a good job that pays well, my family is healthy and I have friends. To me, my life is unbearable. I am not ungrateful and I really do appreciate everything that I have in my life, but it is very hard for me to get out of bed in the morning and live out my day. 

One of my main problems is my weight. I know this may seem vain to some of you, but it is a huge problem for me, someone who already struggles with low self esteem. I have gained about 15 lbs in a year, and I cannot control what I eat, nor can I motivate myself to work out. I do not recognize myself anymore, none of my old clothes fit, and I can't seem to be able to do anything about it. Every day, I tell myself, I will eat healthy, I will make better decisions, I will not hate myself, I will not speak down to myself, etc... Each and every day, I fail. This kills me. 

My second problem is that I have a well paying job but it is very stressful and demanding. It takes up the majority of my day and this stress feeds into my poor eating habits. I have considered quitting but I cannot justify saying no to the money. I am scared that if I quit to try to focus on myself, I will just eat more and more because I will be less busy.

Having depression is like sailing with a hole inside your boat and only a bucket to keep you afloat. Depression is wanting to have friends but are too anxious to go out and stay a while longer. Depression is forcing yourself out of bed, not for yourself but those who count on you. Depression is having an empty feeling inside your chest while your head is crowded with self loathing. Depression is where people tell you ""it will all get better"" but only hearing the silent whispers of the wind. Depression is where you slowly lose your personality, joy, and interest for those things that you have used to love. Depression is where a stranger tells you ""I'll be here for you"" and you take it as an insult.

Depression is where you hurt, crawl on the floor crying, grabbing on to dear life alone in your dark room with your thoughts, too tired to do anything and then go to bed only to rise again to pretend that nothing happened.

To pretend, nothing happened."

I’m such a fundamentally broken person. I’ve want to say I’ve been fighting for years, but that’a not true. All I can do is fucking run away from everything until the day is over. No action I take to improve myself can ever have weight because I’m so godddamn broken that when I try to do something to better myself, it just reminds me of how much of a fucking loser I am. I cannot handle the fucking *pain* that comes with self improvement. It’s not fun in the least. It’s humbling. Too humbling. And it just shoves in my face all the time I’ve wasted and all of the experiences I never had simply by virtue of being my self. 

Everyone who’s happy acts like life is just some natural occurrence. Like things just happened to them and fell into place. This couldn’t be further from the truth of my experience. Nothing ever just happens organically. Either I try hard and fail due to my lack of intelligence, or I don’t do anything at all. It’s hard to stay happy after constant failure and social rejection. I’ve never had interests or goals or relationships or friends. I never will. These thing don’t just happen. You have to be a certain kind of person for them to happen. I am not that person. I will never be that person because I don’t even know who I want to be, and if I figured that out I would be too insecure to become that. 

All I see in my future is homelessness and destitution because I came into adulthood with absolutely zero interests, special memories, or relevant/helpful past experiences. My memory of my life in general is so goddam hazy at this point, if I ever did have those things, they have long been gone to the abyss. I just think why. Why do I have to be so broken and dysfunctional among everyone else? I’m not even a real person. I’m a complete shell of what could have been a person. This is too difficult to come to terms with, while impossible to argue against. It is true. It is my reality. It honestly just makes me angry, bitter, and jealous of others, at a very deep, fundamental, human level, for what the healthy people have. I fantasize about taking two AR-15s and unloading on people. Maybe I know them, maybe I don’t, it wouldn’t matter. Often lives completely lose their value when my headspace gets dark enough. Not as the result of an “illness” but of the fact that I am who I am both physically and psychologically. Blind rage. That is what the result of my dysfunction is. Pure fucking anger at both the world and myself. Unable to cope with my grim reality, all I want to do is destroy. 

The only thing I could ever really destroy is myself. The thought of my life slipping away becomes more attractive by the day as I see how impossible my desires are and how completely fruitless any effort to change is sure to be, just like it always has. I can’t handle the responsibility of being alive and I don’t want to anymore. I’m just here for the hedonistic pleasures life sometimes offers, until either I or something else kills me."

“Do you know that feeling when your alarm clock rings, and you don't want to get up, do anything, see anyone, you just want to turn off the world?
Now imagine you have that feeling every morning, and it never goes away. It stays with you, in the morning, day, night, when you are with friends or alone. You try to get rid of it, but nothing works.“"
ds,"Laid off today
Had a good year for the most part, but walked into work today and after about an hour I got laid off after 3 years. Man... the shame and self disappointment was pretty hefty telling my girlfriend. It makes me feel less viable as a man, not even sure of the future anymore."
ds,"Getting motivated to get help
I was diagnosed with a mood disorder and PTSD ~1.5 years ago. I was getting help for a while but I dropped out of school and moved out of state so I just haven't been able to do that in the past year. I live with (and mooch off of) an SO but I've been fairly isolated for about 6 months. I've been doing online school but had to drop my classes this semester when I started working. Now all I do is this stupid part-time job. I should probably quit because it makes me incredibly suicidal. It's all so superficial. It doesn't feel beneath me but I really just don't mesh with it. 

Anyway. Health insurance. I can't figure out how to fill out the income stuff. A hospital near me has people that can help but I just can't find the motivation to even call them. It's like I'm trying to prevent myself from getting help. It's not even just psychiatric reasons that I want health insurance. I have a referral for a neurologist. I've been having memory issues, twitches, etc. I know I won't go without insurance. I probably could stand to get on birth control and check out some other persistent problems too but a) I know I won't be taken seriously and b) the only thing I genuinely like about myself is my mind so that's the priority.

I'm not completely not trying. I'll take St. John's Wort if I'm persistently suicidal but it doesn't help with motivation. I've been going to support groups. I'll ""decide"" to be motivated but end up collapsed and sobbing before I get out of the door. Play music, leave my phone behind so I don't get sidetracked. Tell people what I'm doing so I feel pressured to keep my word. Incentivize with promises of fast food, caffeine, or chocolate. I dunno what else to do. I can't even tell if it's laziness or depression or something else. The only thing that motivates me to go to work is fear which is also the main thing that prevents me from quitting."

ds,"Why am I like this?
Every time I try to step out of my comfort zone and try to be more outgoing/""normal"" so people will think a little better of me perhaps, I just completely fuck everything up. I don't even feel like leaving my bed anymore.

Why I'm posting this right niw: I somehow convinced a girl that I'm not a complete idiot, and we're together. Since she's ill, I thought I'd swing by and give her a little ""get well soon"" kit with soup, tea, chocolate, that kinda stuff. All that came back was a half assed thank you, no comment on anything in the damn thing I've planned for a week now. I didn't expect much reaction, since she doesn't seem to like spending time with me anyways, but a little more would have been nice. I guess I'm just bad at everything I touch.

Tomorrow I have another test and I’m skipping school again. I already skipped today because I was too lazy to start studying before Sunday and of course I didn’t know shit, so instead of taking responsibility I just skipped school. And I’m skipping again tomorrow because I studied even less for this test.
My grandpa, the father of my mother, is risking death in an hospital bed. My mother is with him in the hospital everyday and every night to keep him company in his last moments of his life and she cries everyday. It hurts me so see her suffering so much. And it hurts me to see my grandpa in such critical conditions. I feel like they’re both miserable but I don’t know how to help.
I wanna hang out with my friends to get rid of all these bad thoughts but I don’t have many, and if I ask them right now they’ll just answer “sorry, we can’t hang out, we have to study”. Which is true, I know it is because I should study, too. But I don’t. I just spend my days staying at home, listening to music and crying because I’m a pathetic piece of shit.
I hate my life. There’s so much monotony in everything. I wanna try new things. I wanna make new friends. I wanna visit new places. I wanna become a new person. But I don’t know how to do it.

ds,"I can't do school work and I have no will power left
The past two years I've been having a mental battle with myself trying to do my work just to come out with bad grades and disappointment from myself and my parents. I don't if I'm depressed, an idiot, or just a lazy piece of shit but I'm tired of fighting and I just want to throw in the towel. I know my parents just want the best for me but they can't help me. Even when I'm in class it takes all my mental strength to do the simplest things like take notes. The most frustrating part is that nobody thinks I try to do anything. Everyone treats me like a complete dumbass because I can't do my work. I used to have an amazing memory when I was 5-6 years old but when I started elementary school and now it gets worse and worse every year. Sometimes I'll talk to someone and forget what we're talking about in the middle of the conversation for a second. I can't organize anything and I give up before I even try because I know in my head I won't be able to do it anyways. I couldn't pay attention in class if you payed me to do it. And I hate myself for it. I hate that I can't do simple tasks and I that I can't remember anything but I can't control it. It doesn't even feel like I'm in control of my life anymore. Is there anything I can do to help myself. I'm trying to change my diet and meditate as of recent. I want to be in control of myself again. I'm only in 8th grade and I feel like here's one last chance of hope before I trash my gpa and end up working at McDonald's. If you can think of anything that might help please reply. I might just do an lsd trip for insight to find a solution but I'm worried I'll just mess with my brain even more. Anything you Can think of will be great."
ds,"The moment of clarity
I've had suicidal ideations for as long as I can remember. Despite this, I always wrote off my depression as not being a problem. Throughout my entire lifetime, my thoughts have been so warped that I just assumed that they are normal parts of the human experience. It sounds so stupid typing things out. The moment I realized that my mental illness was ""real"" was coming to the conclusion that well-adjusted people do not think about killing themselves on a regular basis.

And with that, came my wake up call to get help.."
ds,"I feel like depression has turned my brain into mush and now I can’t be successful in anything
Last year I stopped being productive at work and it’s now seeping into the rest of my life. I used to receive accolades for being great at my job. I was even at the top in the nation at my job when they looked at my metrics and sales. But now I’m just sad all of the time and I can’t think straight. 

Every morning I wake up I start the day ready to take it on. I tell myself I’m going to be productive and make strides to complete goals. But then I can’t bring myself to do anything. There are days where I can sit at my desk for hours just thinking about how I should be working on something. But then when I try, it’s like I can’t think straight. The things I used to be good at now don’t really seem to make sense to me. I feel like my brain is literally turning into mush. 

I started seeing a therapist, I started taking anti depressants, I exercised for awhile, I tried meditating, I feel like I’m trying everting in my power to get me mind right. But my brain is mush and now I can’t be successful in anything I do. School is starting to slip and my friends keep asking why they never see me.

My SO keeps telling me to “take small steps” but that’s what I’ve been doing for a year now. It’s not working. I’m stuck in a cycle of waned to be better and “woe is me”."

I've been trying to block him but he keeps making more accounts telling me to kill myself and that noone cares bout me. he has told me to shoot myself in the head with a gun, drink battery acid and tells me that my friends on PlayStation are no life's for supporting and putting up with me. He also hacked into my friends YouTube channel a while back and took it down thus causing me to have to delete my main YouTube channel and lose a majority of my videos due to him threatening to do it to me too. I can't contact law enforcement as they don't seem to care and he even went so far as to make a fake girl account on twitter and try flirting with me to talk to him.

She tried to rediagonse my depression as a narcissistic personality disorder. There's a laundry list of things that have been said to me. It's making me feel useless and sad and reinforcing the notion that no matter how hard I try I will never be good enough, that maybe I deserve to be alone, etc.

I feel like I'm going to have to either let her continue to talk to me like this or stand up for myself and lose her as a friend. While the latter option gives me the peace of mind to think it's not me, that I had enough self worth to stand up for myself and not cave to my friends abusive reinforcement, I really don't want to lose her as a friend.

ds,"Long Winded Post From a Failed 30 Year Old
I don't even necessarily want to write this but I need to clear my head. I've been a depressed pissant for as long as I could remember. Some of my youngest memories are melancholic and sickly devoid of confidence or even reason.

I grew up dirt poor. I remember spending a night pushing a needle through the rubber of my shoes to get the sole back on. My mom had a stroke and an aneurysm but survived. Sort of. She became a wicked, wicked creature who loved pitting me against my sibling and I never came out on top. My entire life has been from the cowering creature perspective. Life isn't experienced but something that happens to me.

I joined the Army at 18. I had gotten recklessly married a month prior to shipping to basic. I ended up fucking up and missing a bus which led to a Lemony Snicket series of Unfortunate Events type shit. I went through partial infantry brainwashing but never made it past the build-up.

So I ended my career, the only thing I've wanted to do, before it even took off. Luckily, it was more of a ""this isn't working so we'll forget it happened"" type deal and my enlistment ended without anything terrible. But I never recovered. At least back then I had some sort of tenacity. Now? I'm a fucking shell, mate, of what I was. A completely hollow individual.

I'm 30 years old. I've no education. I have no passions. I used to enjoy writing but I can't bring myself to write anymore. The moment I try I go back into wounded animal mode. No, this isn't good enough. Nope, neither is this. Why bother? Why try? I can't help but think these things.

I'm still married and that is the only reason I haven't killed myself. I did try early on because of relentless hounding from my father in law. It is obvious I'm not what he wanted for his daughter. I can't figure out why I'm alive at all. I can barely live my life.

I'm depressed constantly. No matter how happy I know I should be or how wide I smile I'm in the grey of storm clouds that seemed, at least until this subreddit, to be only over my head. I've had so many jobs that I just explosively quit. I've got Intermittent Explosive Disorder as well as depression and anxiety. So I coil up and wind tightly before my brain dumps chemicals that make me explode with no regard for the damage done. I'm currently unemployed. I left my last job like that. I loved my job. I loved the guy I worked for. I earned several raises within a few months and was promoted quickly because I threw my back into that work.

It has been too long though. I can't seem to find another job. I can't even bring myself to apply anymore. I don't have a car. I ""rent"" a couple rooms off the main house of my inlaws. I failed so hard in giving my wife a life worth living. She spends her time working and though understands and doesn't mind my unemployment it is killing me.

On Dec.12th I lost all interest in anything. I used to escape in video games but now I can't. I load up Ark and just stare. I've anxiety about everything. Recently installed Heroes of the Storm and I played a mean Lili and Abathaur but now I've got butterflies even playing against bots. The smallest, most simple of tasks seems beyond me.

I'm stupider than I used to be. How I interpret the simplest of sentences or instruction is out of whack. I have trouble reading though I've got tons of read Omnibuses from Warhammer 40k on my bookshelf. I have trouble speaking. I talk slowly and can barely push out the words off my tongue. I'm only recently able to make phonecalls without losing my mind anxiety wise.

I'm so full of regret. I hate what I became. I hate that I married someone and am dragging them through the mud. To never have a real apartment or car. I can't hold a job. I barely take care of the house. I do dishes now but it is a real struggle.

I've been thinking a lot more about suicide and I'm already sure I am too cowardly to really do it but I think about it a lot. How it'd hurt my wife but I think it'd be good for her to find someone else. I just don't see the point in continuing. I'm an adult now but I never learned how to properly be an adult.

I don't know what to do. There is a burning hole in my chest and I feel guilty that I'm the way that I am. Even on the subreddit. I know people feel that people who've a significant other can't be as depressed but I'm swimming at the bottom of the barrel.

I want this all to end. I don't know how to survive. I don't know how people manage it. I don't have that self-preservation sense that keeps people going despite it all. I'm weak. I am weak in ways that I can barely accept.

I struggle a lot with the fact 22 veterans a day kill themselves but I'm still around. I carry endless guilt that better people die and I'm still alive. Goddamn it. People are dying from diseases and cancers while I exist. While I can't so much as go outside without feeling like all eyes are boring holes into my psyche. I hate that all I do is sit here and lay in bed. I hate myself.

I feel if I don't get this out, even if it is never seen by anyone, I will implode. I'm on medication and it helped my depression but then the reality of my life struck me and I think I'm worse off than I was. At least then I was able to lose myself in video games. Now I'm here with the stark reality. I am not meant for this world. I am too sensitive, too weak, too weak-willed, and too much of a bitch to handle life. I'll go back to lurking now. Thanks for listening."
ds,"Is it stress, depression or burn out?
Hey,

I’m a diabetic 1 with Autism. For the past 3 years i have felt constant fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems, bad memory and concentration issues.

I took antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg before this during 8 months for major stress and it helped me with almost no side effects.

But after i quit antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg ,the fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems and concentration issues has been persistent in my life. Now for 3 years.

No matter how much rest i get i feel tired. Even if excercise, eat healthy, do yoga and meditation.

My blood sugar levels has been up and down lately. But even if they are controlled i feel the same. 

A cause could be that i have worked on a lot of projects during the past 3 years. 

It went as far as that i started to get suicide thoughts. I do not feel any ups or downs in my life. Things i used to like to do isles enjoyable. I rather stay at home than being social.

I believe i have major depression and i have visited psychologist and psychiatrist who have advised me to take antidepressants.

But the question is if I’m stressed, have major depression or simply burnt out.

I certainly feel that i have a huge major depression. My OCD thought are back and i have been stuck on testing my blood sugar 10-15 times per day during the past year. Which also could bring my stress levels up. The past year has been very stressful for me work wise. But even if i get a weekend of rest i don’t feel rested. I have been to different psychiatrists and psychologist and the conclusion is either major depression or burn out.

I barely have the energy to clean my apartment anymore, wash my clothes or think about my hygiene. I feel tearful occasionally on some days. 

I have thought about taking antidepressants again, particularly Cymbalta since it worked for me the first time. But i have been afraid of taking them. 

Instead my psychiatrist described me brintellix (Vortioxetine), 10 mg per day for my depression.

But the question is, i’m i stressed, depressed or burnt out? Anyone have been in a similar case? 

Any experiences of the antidepressants brintellix (Vortioxetine) for major depression? I’m so afraid of starting to take them, but i don’t want to feel this way of every morning waking up with no motivation for anything that the day brings me."

Now that I'm back home, I'm back to being just as despondent as I was before. I'm cold and distant again. I don't want to talk to anybody. I'm back at work, in a horrible job with horrible people. I don't want to talk to my mom because she doesn't get it and it feels like she can't be bothered to try.

ds,"Does anyone else miss the person they used to be?
I've always struggled with depression, but sometimes it's more manageable than other times. I've noticed that with every new year and myself getting older, I begin to look back on my past and long for it, even sometimes breaking down because I miss the person I used to be.

I'm 23, so still young, but I really wish I could go back and be 19/20 again because that was when I was truly happy. I had moved out of my hometown, had lots of friends, a good relationship, I lost tons of weight and was confident for the first time ever, I traveled and worked for fun instead of working as a means of survival. I loved life, I had so much energy and such a bright outlook on everything and I had a lot of fun.

Now, that's all over. I really only have one good friend left from those times and he doesn't even live near me anymore; sometimes I get really down when I think about old friends and start thinking about things I could've said differently that might've prevented the arguments we had that would eventually lead to the end of our friendship, I really never knew how much I needed them until they no longer wanted me in their lives. My relationship fizzled out in the same way and I've yet to develop a connection like that with anyone again. I've also gained all my weight back and can't stand to look at my own reflection.

I don't know how to be happy like I was again. I look at old pictures from times past with old friends, destinations I went too and I want to cry because I just wish I could go back. I'm so depressed and hate myself, I'm incredibly lonely and am just a shell of the person I used to be. It's like I'm mourning my past life or something."

I'm a freshman in high school and we just did volleyball tryouts and they were fucking horrible. I had to wake up at 5:30 to go to them because they started at 6. Literally everyone there was better than me. I fucking hate everything. I'm such a failure. Like everyone was doing actual spikes and sets and shit and I was just there. They probably thought I was in special ed. At least if I had a mental disability I would have an excuse to be so shit at volleyball. I'm probably gonna quit tbh. I've never wanted to die more in my life. And I know you're probably gonna say do your best and I am but my best isn't good enough. This is what I get for trying to be less depressed using a sport. I don't even look like I'm in high school,I'm just a short 5'0 Indian kid"

We're learning about buddhism and in buddhism you have to realize that everything is suffering. Isn't that relatable, i don't know if i even paid proper attention but damn, that's true. Life is suffering and pain."
ds,"Who here forces themselves to act normal because of social anxiety?
I have really strong anxiety and depression. To the point where I hate being around people yet I don't like ""loneliness"".
When talking to people I try talking in a normal confident tone. Other than not taking initiative on things you really cannot tell I'm depressed."
ds,"Addicted to escapism
If I am not occupying myself with any form of entertainment (games, books, movies, music, drawing, writing, etc.) I feel depression and anxiety. Whatever I do in real life, there is a heavy stone in my chest, if you know that feeling. I cannot escape sadness, boredom and loneliness whatever I do. I only feel really good when I sleep and have wonderful dreams."
ds,"I think I'm dropping out of college
Been depressed for a while and I'm currently on medication and about to start therapy.

Last semester I missed a lot of my classes and made everyone in school worry, managed to save the semester with good grades thanks to some amazing teachers and the new semester just started but I don't think I can do it. I stared missing class again and everything just stresses me out so much. I don't even know if this is what I want to do with my life, but I know my parents really want to see me with a degree and I don't want to disappoint them (also I'm terrified of telling them)

God I hate this feeling, I'm really freaking out right now. I don't know if what I want to do is right, maybe it will make things worse, maybe I'm just a lazy horrible student.

Right now I'm just gathering the courage to tell my parents, I know it has to be today. Anyone else in a similar situation? Any thoughts or advice?"

ds,"Anyone else read books as a form of escapism?
I know for some people depression can be so crippling that you can’t even find the motivation to pick up a book let alone focus long enough to read it. That used to be me although I’ve always been interested in reading and loved it until my depression became that crippling. But since getting put on adderall for my ADD, I’m able to get back into reading books. Mostly fantasy books

It helps me literally be in another world for a while and forget about my problems for a while and feel like I’m living another life for a while. It’s not a cure obviously for depression but it does seem to help me a little temporarily.  

Anyone else have a reading habit or have found reading to be helpful in this way ?? And if so, what do you like to read ?"
ds,"When people with good intentions say the wrong shit..
How do you deal with it? When someone who is just trying to help you says something that cuts you really deeply, or when they are pushing you when you just need them to back off while. How do you personally deal with it? 

Recently I had an Uncle who I was close with get involved trying to help with my depression and anxiety issues. He encouraged me to go see a therapist again for the first time in years and was just there to talk and encourage. Then when he saw progress he started pushing more and more and I started getting really stressed. Then when I had a break down and started slipping back he took said some shit to me which really cut me deep. I stopped talking to him for a while after that. He said things that confirmed what I thought people in my family were thinking abou me. 

Now the issue I'm facing. I don't feel justified in being angry at him because he was trying to help and he just got too excited at seeing progress that I had made many times before and then he got frustrated when it came to a halt. So now I just feel guilty at having the feelings and the anger turns inward and eats me up. But the anger and hurt don't go away from what he said either. It's been months and I just don't want to talk to or see him at all. He's reaching out again and I can't find the words to  explain the anger and hurt I feel, because I feel like I shouldn't be angry or hurt. So it's just a big spiral of anger and shame. 

The worst part is I don't know of I can ever have the same relationship I had with him before. We were buddies. Even if I get over this I just don't know if the trust will ever be back. This makes me sad. I didn't really want him involved, but good intentions make it hard to tell people their help isn't wanted."
ds,"Getting my BA
Accomplishment in a reality that uses a perception of truth is mediocre at best. But it is an accomplishment and should be celebrated. I found a lot of like-minded individuals who only run on hope, who understand there are no absolutes."
ds,"Does anyone else imagine their depression as being much more 'dramatic' than it actually is?
I always think of my depression as being something quite mysterious and I dramatise it in my own mind. It's as if my brain is just trying to make something of depression, which ultimately makes it worse because it gives part of my brain comfort in depression, as it least it gives me some kind of identity.

I imagine it as being this huge struggle with myself, almost like a character in a movie or a book and glorify the worst parts of it to provide myself with any comfort I can. It's pretty toxic but it's one of the only ways I can deal with it, does anyone else find themselves doing a similar thing?"

I was a carer for my mum I look after her.

And yet, despite all of that, I still have this need to sleep excessively because I keep having dreams that are more entertaining, adventurous, and exciting than what's currently going on in my life. 

And even when I rewire my sleep schedule back to normal, I still end up going back to the messed up sleep schedule just cause I hate feeling depressed and hate dealing with it."
ds,"I dont understand how people can be so interested in so many things
First, let me apologize for formatting issues, I am typing this on mobile.

 I generally find television boring, have little to no interest in Netflix shows, anime, and most video games and hobbies. I really only have one hobby that I have feel attachment to,  and frankly, I dont enjoy most new shows. If I watch something of my own, its typically something I watched from when I was younger, like scooby doo or Phineas and ferb as the two main ones, being my absolute favorites from my youth, though that's rare as it is. And whenever I do those things, except for my one main hobby sometimes, I feel that I am all to aware that it's just escapism, and instead of escaping, I fall back into the same track. I don't  think I have a short attention span, but that's what I always feel like I go back to in the back of my head, as that's what people my age are supposed to have because of this digital age."

I was diagnosed with depression about 4 years ago. Honestly every single day for the past 5 years I have debated killing myself, I tried a few times but I was unsuccessful. Really I was down in a hole, couldn’t seem to find an escape.
My parents tried their best but were at a loss.

Finally, I met A [18 M] last september and we started dating in July. And he has been the most supportive person i have ever met, would take days off of work to take care of me when I was too sad, would help me talk through things, told me why he loved me and that the flaws didn’t matter to him. He is the absolute best and I haven’t even thought about suicide for the past three months.

It gets better, I was really lost, was hoping i would die and I found my cure. Maybe your cure won’t be someone else, maybe it’ll be medicine or yourself but please don’t give up because i would have regretted it so much. The world has so much more to offer"

ds,"Dropping by to mention you should take some Vitamin D supplements.
Of course, check with your doctor. Etc. etc. 

Vitamin D is the sunshine pill that most people are deficient in. This is also much more of an issue in colder areas or for those who cover up from the sun often. The best way to get vitamin D is through certain food combinations and routines in sitting in delicate morning sunlight and in most cases, taking a supplement is necessary to keep this vitamin flowing in your body. 

Vitamin D is best absorbed with calcium, so if you’re taking a supplement, finding foods, or sitting in the sun consider to add the calcium as well. 

You will find that your mood will be better or more stable with vitamin D consumption.

Make sure to strive for a more regulated sleeping schedule as well and something to keep your mind stimulated without an electronic screen.

Hi!

I’m A.M. and I’m writing to introduce a new initiative named YourAmigo. Basically we are a group of friends that have to decided to form this initiative to help anyone who need an “amigo” (Spanish word for friend). We work by assigning anyone who wants it, an “amigo” with whom you can talk about anything. We don’t accept donations, though if anyone wants to help us or has any suggestions, feel free to contact us.

Let me explain who we are :)

We are not therapists, and we realize that we are not capable of solving your problems, or even comprehend your pain; but we can listen to you. We want to hear your stories, we want you to tell us whatever you’d like to say. In the end we just want you to feel heard. And of course, you will never be judged.

You know guys, we have all been there, in that cold and lonely place. For some, this place will be terrifying and called depression, for others it might be something less severe. But we don’t care. If it is important enough for you to feel bad about it, then it would be an honor for us to hear about it. 

Here’s how we work: below you have the email address where you can find us. Please write us. In your first email, you can tell us anything you want, though a little bit of your story is always welcomed (though not required!). And that’s it!

Here’s our email address: youramigoam@gmail.com

And that’s it! Last but not least, I want to thank you for reading this far. I really encourage you to text us. Moreover feel free to copy and paste this message in any other forum: the more people that read this, the more people we can help!

See you soon!

A.M."

7 years.. Holy shit.. It'll be 7 years in May..
It still feels like yesterday when I got that call from your dad, telling me what happened. And I remember dropping everything I was doing at work, and rushing to the hospital.
Slowly walking into the room, with your family gathered around you, that's when it hit me, and I broke down.. I lost it.. Couldn't control myself, and I couldn't stop crying.
When I had to say goodbye, it broke my fucking heart.. Losing my best friend, my fiancé, was the hardest day of my life.
But every year after, the pain slowly faded away, and it didn't haunt me anymore.
But last week, when your dad called me and said that he'd be in town for work, and wanted to get together, it made my day. Hadn't seen/heard from him in about 6 months. But last night, when your sister called, and told me that your dad passed away in his sleep from a heart attack, it was like the whole world had stopped spinning again..

ds,"Getting over a girl
Hello everyone, I’ve been subscribed to this sub for a while now but always been a lurker and never posted anything. I feel that this is the best place to get advice and help for what I’m going through right now...

So I’m a 19 year old guy, I’ve never had a serious relationship with a girl before. 

I met this girl a few weeks ago and I instantly liked her. She’s the most amazing girl I’ve ever met. She’s funny, smart and so beautiful. We started texting/snapchatting. I told her I liked her and she said she felt the same about me. We started “talking” and we met a few times and things were going really well. Last weekend she stopped over at my house and we watched some Netflix and had such a good night with each other. I knew I was in love with this girl and I could honestly see us getting in a relationship in the future. After she left my house the following morning she started acting weird. I asked her what was wrong and she said her ex boyfriend was going crazy because she stayed over at my house. She then said she just needed to be alone for a while and that we should stop seeing each other because she still hasn’t properly got over her ex. It was so horrible, I started crying for ages and I couldn’t stop. I still feel so upset about it and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get over her. How can I get over her? I can’t stop reading our texts messaging of us saying we love each other. This is so hard. I’m crying again."
ds,"Everything has changed...
 About four years ago I was the typical loner. I was in the middle school. Nobody took me seriously, because my hobbies were not shared by anyone else. I'm from a small town, so it was difficult for me to find someone who actually liked the things I did. At the time I liked things like anime, video games and MLP. I am a 19 year old lass now and I only like video games now. 

  In the final grade of my middle school I met a girl. She was about two years younger but liked the same things I did. I was so happy to finally meet someone like me. We have bonded a lot and she was the first person I truly loved, except for my family, of course. 

 About two years ago we started to get distant. She kept talking to me about things I was uncomfortable with, but whenever I tried to talk about something that bothered me, she told me she was busy and didn't hear me out. It escalated in June of 2016. 

  I started talking to her friends, because they seemed like such wonderful people to me. Then we met up, all of us. She kept crying and making scenes. Few weeks before that, she accused me of liking HER friends more than I liked her. But when we all met, it seemed alright, save for her crying etc...  

  When I got home the next day, she told me off. Really badly. She told me to go to hell, called me all sorts of names and I feared... I feared I would never be able to find someone like her again. 

  I tried to end it. Swallowed sleeping pills and drank alcohol. I woke up the next day in a hospital. I woke up to a text from her. One that said she wishes my mother was torn apart by the girl's dogs...

 It's been two years. I've gotten better, met friends that helped me out a lot and I will probably never be able to repay it. But this past of mine, it still haunts me. I don't think I'll ever be able to trust someone like this again. I have gotten so cynical and careless about everything... It still hurts."

My situation with her is exactly like in the movie ""Before we go"" by Chris Evan. 2 strangers meet each other out of 7 billion people but they would never see each other again. And 3 days after we met ( we hung out everyday for the last 3 days), she is gone. We still keep contact but I dont think i would ever see her again ( please dont ask why). She knows about depression. She made me make a promise to reach out to her every time i get depressed.

The last 3 days were the happiest days of my life. It feels like I actually live for the first time. But i also got depressed since. I got depressed because i couldn't recall her image. I couldnt recall her face. I couldn't recall what she looked like when we first met. And i couldnt remember why those were the happiest days of my life. I just recall those were the happiest. All i can recall is a brief moment of her smile for like 5-10 secs, her voice, and the moment when we were about to say good bye that i poured out my heart. Everything is so blurry.  

Then i went on to google to search for blurry memories and depression. And it leads me to ""depression and memory loss"" and "" depression and Alzheimer "" . Then i started to shed tears. I was thinking about the day i actually lost my memories. What if it actually comes, What if one day i wouldnt remember her, my mom, my best friends, and even myself ? I was teaching in class when i shed tears. I had to run to the bathroom and cried in there for 15 mins. Luckily noone noticed.

I remembered my promise to her. I was about to text her. And then i started to cry again. I will bother her. I will make her worried. I will waste her time. And i cant afford to hurt people i love.

This is the beginning of the end.

Please help."
ds,"Older female fighting depression
Hi I’m a 54 year old female that’s recently lost 100 pounds and quit smoking. You think that would solve the depression! But if I don’t keep my mind and body busy at all times, it pops right back up to the forefront. Even when I wake up in the middle of the night just to roll over...Boom, there it is. Sadness and dread. Thanks for listening"
ds,"Sometimes I wonder if I’m just a lazy fuck and not depressed at all
My dad just scolded me over the phone because I was still in bed and its 2PM. My parents has been very nice and understanding since I told them about my depression. But when he said something along the lines of”no one stays in bed all day, everybody has to get up, you have friends who take the bus to work and work all night long. Why should you get special treatment? The only one who can change how you feel is you. And if you want to feel better you can’t play games all night and sleep all day”

I’m still in bed, haven’t eaten anything, haven’t done the dishes like I promised i would, haven’t cleaned my room. I’m worthless."
ds,"I made a word cloud of all my depressive posts over the past three years.
https://i.imgur.com/hNbtyW4.png  

This is based on all the posts on my throwaway account (this is my main account and has too many unrelated posts to sort through) since 2014.  

I think it's noteworthy that some of the biggest words in the cloud are negative.  

While going back over these posts from so relatively long ago, I noticed that most of the older ones seemed like they were written by a total stranger. If it were somebody else saying those things about me, it would be called harassment, but it was me saying those things about myself.  All in all, this has really made me realize that all the things I have written about myself are way off-base, and are only true in my mind during a depressive episode.  

I know something's wrong, but I don't know what to do about it. In some ways I'm sure I'll always think this way about myself, regardless of what I do, but I wish there were an easy way to manage it.

I used [this](https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/) word cloud generator.

ds,"Why did I get drunk as fuck the night before my midterm?
Is it because I'm depressed and I don't give a fuck about school? Is it becasue I'm using my depression to rationalize not having to study bc im a lazy fuck? but of course thats a symptom of depression. i just don't know anymore because sometimes i wonder if i'm exaggerating my depression to get myself out of responsibilities, fuck man.  wish me luck tomorrow i ugess"

Is it all really worth it? 
The hard work. At the job,  on you're self.  And whatever else. 

I mean if this is all im gonna be as a person even after all this hard work... what's the point.  
At the end of the day the only thing i really end up looking forward to is sleeping.  It's honestly the only time I feel okay.  

It's all gone when i sleep,  I'm at peace.  My mind isnt running through everything that makes me feel like trash. 

Is it worth it to continue working as hard as i do at Work? All I ever do is get shafted  or picked on. 

What about going to therapy,  is it worth it to keep going? I mean yeah,  i have someone to vent to and they listin to me. They don't tell me things like, ""you have no reason to feel this way"" or things like that.  

I mean i really don't see a way out of this place.  What am I gonna find to ""make it go away"" 

Some days are bearable, but some days I just wish i could stay in my dreams all day. Sleeping, no hurting. Just.... peace... 

If got a few new things to bring up to my therapist in two weeks i guess...

ds,"I don't know how I'm gonna do it.
I'm 27. I lived alone, had my own stuff, my own life. I gave up everything to join the military. I went to live with my parents again until I left for boot camp. 

I went to boot camp. I got hurt and it stopped my training. I was heartbroken. I had to come home and move back in with my parents because I had nothing to my name. 

Now, I'm stuck with them for at least the next 3 months. I've been back from boot camp since late September. They want me to show them my bank account once a week. They have an amount of my own money that I earn that I can spend every week. I want to leave, but my credit is crap and it won't allow me to get my own place just yet as most places do a credit check. I'm getting my own car here shortly.

I recently had a really bad breakup with a woman who I had spent almost 3 years of my life with. I'm heartbroken and absolutely lost. She was my world. She told me I was her world. She has found someone else and now claims that most of what we had was fake and now she wants nothing to do with me. 

I can't find any reason to continue with life. I don't have any control over my own life. My folks don't want rent, but they control every aspect of the rest of my life instead and every time I walk in the house, I can feel the tension and I get talked to like a child whenever I don't follow their rules. The woman I had committed my life to now practically hates me. I see no way out. 

I just want it all to end. Please let it end."

I can't take it anymore. I'm an atheist democrat living in a family of hardcore christian conservatives. Ive made it clear that Im a democrat, to which they just call me a snowflake all the time, which just makes me resent them even more. I dont dare tell them Im am atheist, but Im thinking about it. I dont have anything to live for anymore. 

I dont have any idea what to do with my life. I dont have any special talent or skills. The only hobby I really have is video games, but Im horrible at those. I've raged so hard at Battlefield that I broke down in tears and drooled everywhere, and anytime I play an RPG I restart so many times that it makes me not want to play anymore. 

All my friends have at least an idea of what they want to do, but I dont even have the beginnings of a clue as to what I want to do with the rest of my life. And to be honest, Im scared of becoming an adult. Managing a budget, doing taxes, paying bills, and shit like that. Im not fucking prepared for it. If I cant deal with the stress of a fucking video game, then I sure as hell cant deal with a job. 

My parents are also hounding me to get a girlfriend. I dont even have a friend who is a girl. All my close friends are male. Hell, the closest Ive came to having a full conversation with a girl is helping her with spanish homework. I aint gay, I just cant talk to girls. The social anxiety makes me want to vomit if I even think about approaching a girl. 

So Im ready to fuck it all and just tell my parents Im an atheist.  Let them send me to whatever fucking counseling they want. Let them disown me and have to go live with a friend. I have no future other than a goddamn walmart greeter at this point"

But he is making my life a lot harder when he doesn't acknowledge my pain.He yelled at me saying that BPD is bulshit,it's a fantasy,that depression is just a joke.

Do you know that feeling where you just feel... lost?  You feel trapped in a world that you didn't want to be in, forced to try and functional like a normal member of society.  You want to die, but you're so conflicted about death.  You're conflicted about everything.  You can't decide whether it'd be better to feel nothing or to let out all your emotions.  You procrastinate so much, because it all feels so worthless.  Happiness lasts a few minutes, but rarely through an entire day."

Just getting in my covers and wrap myself in a blanket. Everything's dark and my body's resting. I wish I could be there all my life.

Just the ritual of wrapping myself and then getting comfortable is the only thing to make me smile. I then daydream, and in that state where I'm conscious but not enough to acknowledge my problems, I fall asleep.

But then there comes tomorrow, and sometimes I wish I could have stayed awake all night to avoid waking up and facing reality, but then I remember I love sleeping.

It's been 5 months after graduating from college and I've never been depressed more than ever. Unemployed and feeling worthless. Parents are forcing me to get a job already, Peers landed their dream jobs / found a job that pays well and earning more money than me. The feeling of being worthless is overwhelming. Crushing. While unemployed, I've finished a free short course on graphic design and got my certification after passing the assessment and currently doing one on web development. I want to learn more skills in order to land a good job. But I don't think my parents would understand, as they want me to get a job already, any job (Customer Service Representative jobs are a trend in our country which most of fresh graduates end up, I'm not detesting that kind of job but it ain't my thing). I'm depressed more than ever. Fucking anxiety. I've been avoiding my  peers because I don't want them to see me unemployed and broke. I'm anxious because I don't think I'm worth it and anxiety had been a problem for years. I'm depressed because of the pressure my parents are giving me. I'm mad because nobody understands me. I'm sad because I don't have anybody. I'm afraid because I might end up a loser in the end.  I'm a mess because of the all of the above.  (God.

Bridges were burned

Yet my heart it still yearns

Lessons were learned

Inside I still burn 

Not a flame of love, nor an ember of passion

A blue flame lit, reminiscent of what I'm lacking

A lonely lit candle that pains my insides

Those tears of mine dried up, no longer can I cry

New year, I'm out of luck, anxious and somber here I lie

I scratch and I scratch, yet numbness blocks out the feeling

There's no way to patch up, I'm broken glass I'm far from healing

Empty conversations with people I could not care less about

I envy healthy relationships, ones that I could not have, no doubt

Eyeballs that cannot weep and screams without sounds

I'm still depressed when people are around

Yet I'm hard to read, I'm one to bleed

Waste time as I scroll through my social feeds

Waste hours as thoughts take over and I can't sleep

I cannot compete

Yet I cannot accept

Looping like a gif in my head

The words you said

Up until now

And from the day that we met.

If you read this thanks for reading."

I had to come off of my antidepressants for medical testing. I'm finally off of them and I can't take this. I didn't think they were working and I definitely wasn't where I wanted to be when I was at my maximum dose, but oh my God. I started them for anxiety mostly so I'm surprised that I'm relapsing so hard into depression. I just wish I didn't exist-- eh, better yet I wish I didn't have to participate in every day life. I don't know what to do. I used to have so much motivation to finish my college work and now I have none. I have finals that start tomorrow that I haven't studied for at all. Like, not even a little. And somehow I don't care. That's just not like me. I'm exhausted from putting so much effort in all the time. I exhausted from being stressed all the time. I don't want to keep doing this. I just want to sleep. And to think I have four more years ahead of me. I don't know what I'm going to do. I already feel like a failure. I keep thinking that maybe I could find something to take my mind off things but I have no hobbies. I don't enjoy anything any more. Not even eating, which I used to love probably too much but hey. I want to lie in my floor and watch the days pass by me. I don't want to have to keep trying. Another thing is everything and everyone irritates the living hell out of me now. The smallest thing sends me over the edge into my spiral. Three weeks ago if I spilled my coffee I would have laughed it off. It happened the other day and I cried for hours and was so angry. 

Three weeks ago I was better than this. And I'm crashing all of a sudden. I don't know how I'm going to study for my finals and maintain my GPA to keep my scholarships. I'm fucked probably. My therapist is not that great and I haven't seen her in awhile and I don't have money to go back to her. My psych appointment isn't until late January, after my medical procedure. 

I just want to be happy and have some motivation for fucks sake."

I've asked for help a year or so back and when I got the chance to talk to a chaplin and explain how I just hate the navy and what's it's done for me all he told me was that it's good I'm in and I need to suck it up and move on. 

Now I'm at a new command. Ones that's actually very strict and now with problems like this there's actually bad repercussions for depression and shit so I asked someone I knew from my last command on what to do and he got a hold of someone here and shit blew up. I had chaplins calling me and a bunch of higher ups and I denied the chaplins talk because of my problems with the last one and I just went with a first class instead. Once again all they told me was how great the navy is and how my problems are just me being a pussy pretty much. Why doesn't any care about how we feel or how I feel.

His name was Archer, he was my cat, and he was my best friend. A woodland animal killed him, he was defenseless..

I've tried with different cats to fill the empty void, but they were never aware of me. Archer was always where I was, and were going. I cry every time I lay down in bed, look to my side and expect a short purr and a hop to my lap.. now there's nothing."

It's like stumbling around in the darkness.
You can't see, you can only feel.
Blinded by the pain of reality.

You beg it to stop,
as the throbbing in your heart grows stronger.
But it's not gonna stop,
no matter how hard you beg.

Your so called 'friends' abandon You,
because your depression talk has gotten too dark.

But what's the worst part?
That you can't control it?
That you can't stop it?
Maybe it's the fact that just maybe...
just maybe you don't want It to stop.

You cling onto your pain,
because after all..it's familiar.
It's been with you for a while.

You stand upon the dark edge,
upon the highest edge you could find.

You feel the wind blow in your face.
You freeze.
All the good moments,
All the good people.
It all comes in floods of part nostalgy and part regret.

What took you to this edge?
What made you so desperate,
To take such drastic action?

While the pain is temporary,
This thing you're about to do - 
It's permanent.

Recently he has been going to IOP (can’t exactly remember the name, but it’s a step below inpatient care) at a facility and he has shown some progress. I feel like he’s more in touch with how he feels and is working on coping mechanisms better. However he did not go to his session today and that caused problems. He got his check from work today and it would not get deposited, and that set him off into a fit. He started breaking things and getting in both mine and my parents faces, cussing and attacking us. We had a conversation after and he said he tells himself the thing we tell him, such as how he needs to be more rational and more committed to getting better. He also eats unhealthy and is overweight, and I’ve attempted to help him get healthier about a month ago, but he stopped listening to me about. I love and care for him deeply but our family is at our wits end with what to do.

Why did you even tell me you would make it up to me and gain back my trust when you don't prove anything? Why do you keep telling me so much lies? When were you ever sincere to me? Was I a rebound? Are you happier with her now when you used to tell me she never made you happy? Did you get what you wanted now? Is that why you left me? Am I the only one dying here? While you enjoy yourself when we only broke up yesterday? Did I really meant nothing to you? When I thought you could love someone like me because I can't even love myself. I depended on you and you destroyed me. I gave up everything for you. My dreams, my friends, my family, my time, my efforts, blood, sweat and tears for you.

I am not mean't to be loved. I am so capable of loving someone so much but that person is always not capable to give the same love. My heart has been torn apart again. When I trusted you so much with my fragile heart. When I prayed to god you weren't like my previous ex. You became like him.. except you were even worse. Why promise me things that you couldn't keep? Why tell me that you love me when you never did.. I just hope that all the memories we had together, at least just one tiny part of it was sincere.

Just lonely, need to get out of my head."
ds,"The toughest pill to swallow is that I care about the girl most
I've lost all motivation for my academic life, have basically no ambition left and have just been floating around doing nothing the past few years. My parents trusted me and are probably disgusted by me right now.


I've lost all my Bitcoin in a fire. I was one of the early pioneers and had literally a couple hundred thousand dollars worth not too long ago. I'll admit this one was getting to me quite a bit. Especially since I could've prevented it.

But you know what really incited and is still by far the biggest part of my depression? A girl. A stupid, uninteresting, normal ass girl. But I love her. I love being around her. And she probably doesn't even give a shit about me because she has a boyfriend. We hung out at a park and had a great time, we always do when we talk... But she's never the one to start a conversation and never offers to hang out. Okay, boyfriend, but at least let me be your friend. Just planning a meetup is such a pain the ass. I wish you'd just tell me to fuck off, but you keep saying yes. All while you straight up don't give a shit about me.

Hope is the worst part. I'm still clinging to my failing studies, new random ass coins and this *fucking* girl. I can't even concentrate on the other two because I think of her all the time. I'm desperately trying to stay relevant to her in hopes I can catch her when she is available again and I feel like such a fucking creepy loser. All for that small chance."
ds,"Making friends...
Literally one of the hardest things ever. If you haven't found a group in middle school, you literally have to make friends with everyone in the group. And then, entertain them and convince them you're interesting for literally a year on end.

Then, I imagine you have a shot of getting invited somewhere. I'm not a fucking magician, I can't keep you entertained consistently for that long.

And these people never reciprocate the effort you put in because they have a group and you don't. I gotta work 10 times as hard because I didn't get lucky in middle school like these guys...

lol..."
ds,"I don't care about anything.
I have been really trying to figure how to stop feeling this way and I've seen a pattern which is just do something. Be create. Do something you like. Shit like that. I don't think people understand that I don't care about anything. I don't care. I don't like anything. I tolerate it. I don't like my favorite shows. I don't my old hobbies. I don't like the people I used to like. I don't like anything. I don't care about anything. I feel empty. Like all the things that made me who I am is gone. I don't care. How is ""doing I like"" helpful when I don't like anything? When I don't about anything I am doing? That is the reason I stopped doing first place. How is doing those things again going help me? This is like the biggest suggestion I have seen and I think pretty unhelpful. I can't just make myself care. I've tried. I wish I could care about those things again but I can't so suggesting to do those things, as if I wanted to stop, is like a punch to the face. ""Oh your depressed? Just do what you like."" No. I don't want to. I don't want things I loved and feel nothing. It hurts to want to enjoy life and can't. To want to care and you just can't. I've tried medication and therapy. I've tried giving so many fucks and I can't. I can't even fake it anymore. I wish I could. How do I care again? Do I just wait? I don't think much longer."
ds,"Nothing.
I have come to a point where I can't do anything. I just drown in my own misery and problems. I tend to overanalyze things. And that hurts my brain. I feel like a failure. That's what I wanted to say. I really want to write more, explain my feelings in full detail, I just don't have the energy. Not even for that."
ds,"I probably ruined everything
Tonight I ruined almost a year of work. My girlfriend of 12 years and I had a really rough 10 months, and I have been working really hard to build up our relationship. However, tonight my depression and an existential crisis got the best of me, and I made a stupid decision. I tried to steal a bunch of things from Walmart, but I got caught. Her sister is the manager, and was the one who caught me. I told my girlfriend and she didn’t say anything. I’m worried that I’m going to lose her. If I lose her, I’ll have nothing. I may as well not exist, because she is my only source of happiness. I know I don’t deserve her, but I need her desperately."
ds,"I thought I'd share two quotes that I liked/felt I could relate to.
I don't know why I feel like sharing them here, but maybe somebody can take something away from them. They're both from Emil Cioran and his work *The Trouble of Being Born*.

The first goes as ""It is not worth the bother of killing yourself, since you always kill yourself too late."" 

The second goes as ""What do you do from morning to night?

I endure myself."""
ds,"Any recommended supplements/vitamins for depression? (Or maybe just tips in general)
Lately, I have been taking Vitamin D and doing some light exercising throughout the week and I have noticed the improvement on my mood.

It might just be a placebo type of thing, but it would be great if any of you guys can recommend more alternatives/habits to do when depressed.

I have depression and I sometimes recognize when I’m starting to fall into a pit of despair and I try my best to avoid it all costs- it is almost impossible to crawl back out!"
ds,"Can people stop telling me that hiking and exercise is the magical cure?
It just frustrates me so much, and continues the perpetual cycle of ""well if I can't make myself better through such simple actions I must be even more of a failure than I realised"".

I appreciate the science behind it, releasing endorphins yada yada, but if I can't bring myself to drink water or get out of bed how am I supposed to go for a jog? If I'm so insecure about myself why would running and jiggling in front of everyone to imagine their sneery comments going to make me feel better?

Where do I find the energy to go for a hike when being awake for three hours makes my body physically ache?

I get it, it's helpful for a lot of people but telling me to go get my yoga pants on and be at one with nature will not cure a thing and by repeating that useless mantra you're making me worse.

Rant over, I'm going back to bed.

Edit: a few people telling me if I exercise I will lose weight and feel better about myself. I only need to try it apparently. On the advice of my doctor, I have tried it, even walking. I do walk, every day, no matter how I feel. I also don't need to lose weight and being overweight is not the reason I am depressed (because I'm not overweight). Just saying to stop preaching the exercise mantra as if it's the only thing that could possibly fix what is a very real mental illness that has nothing to do with how often I move, flex or jump. My point is that it's not working."

Hello guys, I am 17 and I live in Singapore with my Mum. I have been depressed on and off for the past 5 years with serious suicidal thoughts for the last 4. 

I really think that it's time that I start anti depressants because I reckon it would help me tons. The problem is, I don't want my mum to know because the last time I opened up about being slightly suicidal and very depressed, she freaked out on me (don't need to get into details.) She has had a history with it herself and I know that if i ever took my life, it would permanently ruin her. 

At this point, medication is my last resort. I've had a girlfriend and it made no difference whatsoever, I still feel empty most of the time and would rather die than anything else.

I know that in Singapore you're able to consent medically when you're 16, but I'm not sure if i can possible get around her for meds like this without her knowledge/consent. Any help for my situation would be fantastic :) Thanks everyone"

ds,"It feels as if I'm heading towards a dark place
Hey, haven't been here before but I had a quick scroll and this feels like the right sub to vent to. I'm 18 from the UK, I've had a rough educational life (I alway talked, went in high with my friends, got in minor trouble that kinda thing). I fucked up college in the second year of my 2 year diploma course and got excluded for the same kind of shit previously mentioned but on a larger scale, this really fucked me up as I thought I'd end up doing nothing with my life when I really wanted to do something with it. 10 weeks ago I got a job and a paid for graduates course which pays out over £1100 per month after tax which is incredible for me, it's a job I love, work hard at and it's exactly the path I want to take in life career-wise. So I've been given a second start, I have money, great friends, a good social life and my life is on track but I still can't quite feel complete. I'm very social anxious and this affects my everyday life but I push through it, I have to. I smoke week almost everyday and I've been smoking for about 5 years now. The problem is, I still have a void that I can't fill and I can never really feel that happy by myself. I love my metal and I'm a huge music fan, I used to play a lot of games but I've stopped caring so much now. Sometimes I find it hard to enjoy things as much as I used to. I feel exhausted at home as I don't sleep much and the anxiety takes it out of me until I walk through the door. It feels as if it's getting worse and I don't know what to do and I don't even know why I feel this way. Sometimes it can get quite bad where I won't even feel like doing anything but pulling bongs with the TV on in the background as the day is just too much to handle sometimes. 

Sry for the huge wall of text but I'm trying to get this typed quick as I'm about to go out. I don't even know why I'm posting this really, I want to vent, maybe I want advise. I don't know, the fact that I'm even posting this means it's starting to get to me in some way."
bc,"My mother was just diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time. She beat this once already about 8 years ago, so she’s understandably not happy about it. She's been getting checked every 6 months like clockwork, so thankfully they were able to detect this when it was still tiny.

Before she was even diagnosed, both her surgeon and her primary care doctor told her not to lose sleep over this (*not* happening). I don’t know yet what stage it is because she understandably wasn’t in a talkative mood when I called her. She said what scares her this time around is that they want to check a lymph node during the removal surgery. I figured that was standard procedure for all breast cancer patients, but I’m really out of my wheelhouse here. Is that standard procedure? Should I be doing more homework? I love my mother more than anything and the fact that she has to go through treatment again after all these years is just mortifying. I’m hoping we can put this behind us for good this time around so I’m trying to stay as positive and upbeat as possible. 

Is there any advice you guys would recommend? I want to help her during this process in any way possible, but I know she probably just wants some normalcy in her life. Thanks in advance."
bc,"I'm a 26 Y.O. Female and about a year ago I felt a smaller lump on my left breast...being naiive I ignored it (even though breast cancer runs on my paternal side of the family). About 3 weeks ago I was watching the episode of the Kardashians about BRCA testing and wanted to get it done but also noticed the lump felt a little bigger and harder. I made an appointment to see my gynocologist and she suggested I get a sonogram done. The results came back with a lump of a 2.79cm x 2.1cm on my left breast and another one on my right breast (smaller in size and I never felt this one). My gyno wanted me to go in for a biopsy of the LEFT breast only. 

I spoke to a coworker who is a breast cancer survivor and she recommended I go to the breast center she went to for her treatment for another opinion as well as for the biopsy. 

I heard from the breast center today... their radiologist agrees that I should have a biopsy done for the LEFT side only as well so I am going on Wednesday for this. 

Should I be adamant about having them check the right side as well? I am so frustrated with myself for having put this off for so long, but I want them to check both sides - I didn't really get good reasoning from either place as to why they didnt want to check the other side but for me, I don't want to wait 6 months to have it checked again. Thoughts? 

Also, what can I really expect during the procedure? The nurse said it will take about 3 hours but not details of the procedure. 

Thanks for any guidance and advice you can provide!"
bc,"I recently found out about thermography and its uses as an auxiliary screening tool to assess breast health. I've tried it myself and it's pretty cool. It's not commonly used in mainstream doctor's offices, at least not yet and not in the US. Is anyone interested in access to thermography? Do you have any opinions on the technology?"
bc,"Hi all! I'm 24F and I just had a lumpectomy to remove a  breast mass two days ago. I'll try to give my background as short as possible. I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to ask, if it isn't please let me know. 

April 2017: found a mass and had an ultrasound. It was classified as a BIRAD 3 and I was told I would have a 6 month follow up ultrasound. 

October 2017: went to Gyno to explain that the mass was hurting constantly and possibly growing. My doctor thought it was a cyst and since I would be getting imaging done that month, she made an appointment with a breast surgeon for November 27. 

I went to my imaging appointment. They did an ultrasound and had a hard time finding my mass due to dense breast tissue. I had a mammogram done and waited to be told to leave. They came back and said they needed to do it again. Once we were done I was sent to the waiting room and sat around for what felt like an hour. The radiologist came out and asked to feel where the lump was and then asked me to put my clothes on so I could go to his office. His assistant took me back and he showed me the images. He really scared me because he told me my margins were not clearly defined and he couldn't tell what it was. It had also gone from an almond sized mass to a golf ball sized mass. He said breast cancer was low but still an option. I cried the whole way home and immediately made an appointment with another breast surgeon for November 8th. 

November: Met with my surgeon. She didn't believe it was cancer and that it could be a fibroadenoma, fibrocystic tissue, or the phyllodes tumor. The problem is that my mass was not round like a fibroadenoma, it was shaped more like fibrocystic tissue. It is a solid mass though so it couldn't be tissue and with how fast it has grown, it's indicative of the phyllodes. We decided to forgo the biopsy and just take out the mass to determine what it is so that I wouldn't be in extended amounts of pain. I just had the mass removed and I'm doing ok. 

My question is: Has anyone had any experience with phyllodes or a very oddly shape fibroadenoma? My mass had ill defined edges, inward flow, and acoustic echoing. My lymph nodes were fine and I had no signs of calcification or cysts. My doctor said it wasn't round or round with lobulated edges plus the quick growth could indicate phyllodes. I know people say to stay off the internet but everything I've been reading points to phyllodes and from what I've read, it sounds just like it. I know I shouldn't try to self diagnose but waiting is giving me anxiety.  I just wanted to know if anyone had the same experience or symptoms and it turned out to be nothing. Thank you!"
bc,"Hi there. So I'm completely new here so I'm sorry for being rusty. I know you're not doctors, (some of you could be I don't know man) but I think I'm just looking for some form of peace of mind. So here goes. I'm a soon to be 23 year old female with decently large breasts (36GG) so my breast tissue is more than likely really dense and possibly cystic too I'm assuming. Anyway I've been having some strange symptoms lately and went to the doctor. My symptoms are as follows. Clear and sometimes yellow ish green discharge, especially when the nipple is expressed. Small itchy patch of scaly skin on areola and nipple. Severe hypersensitivity of the nipple. On top of all of that, when I went in for all of this, my doctor found a bit bigger than a grape sized lump (it doesn't move, it feels attached to the breast tissue and doesn't hurt). She did note that I do have thick breast tissue but stated this one spot stood out to her and the nurse. All of this is localized to my right breast and I have no issue with the left one. So my doctor scheduled a bilateral diagnostic mammogram and possible ultrasound for this Tuesday and a consult with a specialist/surgeon for this Thursday. I have my concerns as I have a family history of different cancers but not breast cancer to my knowledge. I'm not really worried about it being cancer (I mean I totally am. I have severe OCD so I've been obsessing over it since. I just mean I doubt that's what it is. However so many women my age go undiagnosed because of our age. I'm a skeptic and totally a hypochondriac). I'm sure it's either a cyst, fibroadenoma, or something along those lines and not cancer. However, I'm curious about something. If there's anyone out there who has been diagnosed with breast cancer, did you present any or all of these symptoms? I'm wondering just how likely all of this could be happening at once for cancer. I'm also looking for advice on the mammogram. I'm a wimp with an awful pain tolerance. Sometimes even moving my arm around my chest causes a really bad pinching pain (only noticed it with breast that is in question. Just thought of this). So any advice would be greatly appreciated. What were your symptoms? Are you doing okay now? Hope you're doing lovely. Thank you. 

Edit - also want to note I've been on birth control for almost 10 years. That's a relatively long time and I know it can slightly enhance your risk. Mix of progesterone and estrogen due to heavier cycles as a teen."

She's 29 years old, with a family history of breast cancer (mom at 40, and sister at 18). One growth is behind her areola offset of her nipple, and the other is close to the armpit side of her other breast.

the problem i have is that my mom is a total internet noob, so im trying to figure out what tools would best fit her goal. And her goal is to have a conversation with people dealing with cancer, to help them if she can. She wrote a book few years back, detailing her physical and emotional struggle after being diagnosed with terminal breast cancer, and is working on another book. From what i can see it really helps her psychologically to write. And quite a lot of people call her every month, just to have a chat, ask her advice, so on.


obvious way to have her connected to the net is facebook, but i just wanted to see if anyone had any other idea?


i was thinking of suggesting to her to do a series of youtube videos where she reads her own book (as shes giving it away for free anyway). Maybe do a few videos talking about her life story (shes into meditation, alternative healing, she went through a 42 day water fasting, reads a lot of psychology, philosophy, so on."

My question is, from what I'm reading most dimpling is just that, more dimple like. I'm not reading a lot about vertical lines. It looks more like a true crease as if the bottom part of my breast had been folded.

bc,"30, breastfeeding, lump. Going for a mammography on Monday. BRCA2 maybe?
Hi all!

I really hope I'll be able to get out of this sub within a week or so, but now that I'm in the middle of the waiting stage I feel the need to share with people who get it.

I'm 30, mom of a 20 month old boy and we're looking to try for kid #2. Which is why I finally figured I had to see my GP. I've had a lump in my right breast for a while (4\-5 months at least, probably longer) but shook it off as breastfeeding weirdness. It's growing a little, though. I don't want to find out it's 'something' when pregnant (or preferably never!) so I went to get the 'it's nothing!' from my GP.

She referred me for a mammography (after reading more \- that seems that be step 1 if you're after 30 \- but as I'm breastfeeding I'm not sure it's necessary/very useful. Perhaps an ultrasound would make more sense?). The hospital in my city would have me wait 3 weeks. Luckily insurance is fine anywhere, so now I'll be seen on Monday (within 3 working days, instead of 3 weeks!).

\- Lump is \~1 cm, oval shaped. Can move, doesn't hurt.

\- GP didn't feel anything in my armpit.

\- Still breastfeeding \- I've had mastitis last year and they did an ultrasound at that time.  (Can't recall which breast that was...)

I don't know of anyone in my family who had breast cancer. However, I did do a 23andme last year and have my raw DNA data. I don't have the 3 big BRCA genes 23andme test for, but I do have at least one bad mutation in the BRCA1 group (you can analyse your raw data via other websites). And some other mutations that increase risk for ovarian and breast cancer. I'll be sure to let my doctors know about that. (I only found out about the BRCA1 because I searched for it specifically after getting the referral).

Obviously, my mind is going all sorts of places. I'm happy I have a funeral insurance, thinking of not ever being able to have more kids (doom scenarios, much!). I'm an information hoarder so I'm just trying to accept that part of who I am and go with the flow. Telling me to stay off Google or reddit is not going to help, so instead I'm trying to learn as much as I can. Best case I learn a lot of new stuff that might someday help me support others, worst case scenario I'm already up to scratch on some of the lingo and can go into whatever comes that much more prepared.

Edit: BRCA1, not 2."
bc,"I am 21 with multiple fibroadenomas. I have around 10 fibroadenomas between my breasts and have only had one FNA biopsy on the largest lump (~2cm) in my right breast. It came out as similar to fibroadenoma due to the shape of the lesion.

 I am considering having a double mastectomy in the future as last year March I only had the one lump that they had biopsied and 6 months later for a check up i suddenly had 8 new lumps, and another 6 months later I had a few new lumps and honestly I have kind of lost count because they keep finding new ones. They don't want to biopsy them because of how ""unconfortable the pocedure is for the patient"" and because I have so many. The alternative is to come in every few months for an ultrasound, although they are supposed to biopsy every new lump that appears. 

What it feels like is, that I am waiting for something that is bad to show up in the future. I really don't want to wait for something to show up and after reading many people's experiences with fibroadenomas on forums online, I thought a double mastectomy would be a good choice. 

What do you guys think? Am I thinking too far? I have an appointment set up with my GP this Tuesday to discuss this but I wanted more views. 

Thanks

TLDR; thinking of getting prophylactic double mastectomy due to multiple fibroadenomas to prevent future complications."
bc,"My mother got the dreaded return for more testing letter and went back in yesterday for another exam and ultrasound.   They found a large mass on one of her breasts that she described as a 'star' or 'octopus' not completely black on the ultrasound but grey.   Unfortunately I didn't see it myself.  Her older sister was with her who is a breast cancer survivor (her adopted father died young and her mother had no cancers so history is a little sketchy)and she said it looks like there was good area all around it at least.   She drew a picture for  me of what it looked like and it was pretty huge taking a good portion of the breast up.  They told her it was 4 inches from the front but didn't estimate the size of it.

The last time she was tested was around 4 years prior and it was not there then.   They did a biopsy and are making her wait 3 business days for the results (Monday probably).  

Of course they said they cannot say exactly what it is until the tests come back but from the description and looking online I cannot find anything else really it could be.     Anyone know if its possible that its NOT cancer?  She has no other symptoms really and no lump or anything that she can feel from the outside.  

I have been looking for worse case scenarios and it seems hinged on of the lymph-nodes being involved.    Would they know this at the time of the second screening with ultrasound?   

From what I have learned even a large tumor without spreading could be classed as 2 with a good chance of treatment but that seems like the best possible outcome.

Anyone have experience with something similar?"
bc,"I'm going to cut straight to the chase here and say that I do not feel as though my mum is in safe hands whilst she goes through her treatment.

He has no independence, he relies on her to do everything for him after a 'long day at work' (8:00 AM - 5:00 PM). 

Now, the problem. When she is bed-ridden from her chemotherapy she will not be able to make his dinner, clean the house, make him drinks, walk the dog, prepare his lunch for work, show him affection. These of which are many things that cause him to become angry and aggressive, if not done for him. 

She will need to be taken care of. I will be around, but there is only so much that I can do. However, in this scenario I will be expected to do everything for him and for her as he is simply, incapable. 

He wont make her food - he can't. He wont keep the house clean - he doesn't know how to. She will become intertwined in conflict when he's had a 'bad day at work' (He is passive aggressive). 

My mother, the women who I look up to will be in very poor hands, in terms of care, and its all because of the man she is with, he's incapable and she knows this. 

I'm stuck in the middle because he's aggressive towards me, he's physically violent towards me whenever I help because he can't control his jealousy and doesn't get the 'thank you' or 'reward'. 

All I want to do is help, without him physically hurting myself or verbally abusing my mother, brother or myself. I am just in search of some advise/support during this time. 

Thank you to those who chose to read this and many more to the people who respond."

Hello everyone, my mom is trying her hardest to raise money to be able to participate in this 2day marathon to raise money and awareness for breast cancer. We recently lost our aunt (my great aunt) to ovarian cancer, she had had her ovaries preemptively removed years before . On my moms side of the family there is no question if the women will get cancer the question is when.  My grandma also died of ovarian cancer. My other aunt had her ovaries removed but then she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had to have them removed as well. My mom has already had her ovaries removed but she knows this will only delay the inevitable, because it will just become breast cancer. She is scared to death about when she will be diagnosed and is always actively trying to contribute to the breast cancer research. If you could find it in your heart to contribute I know it will make her year. Thank you."
bc,"I just found out yesterday that my mother has breast cancer. Im kinda a little scared and super emotional over this as I am a mommies boy lol. All I know from what was said is that the doctor confirmed it was cancer to the breast by mamagram (idk how to spell it) and ultrasound. He said that it did not reach any lymph nodes and it appears the body had been fighting it because of the scare tissue around it, and the star like patter to the cancer. She had a biopsy done and is waiting for the results. If you could lend some information my way it would be greatly appreciated. Sorry again if i misspelled any words, and thank you for all your help!!!"

But I hope you guys find help somewhere, anywhere..."
bc,"My boyfriend's mother has been diagnosed with breast cancer. We heard at Christmas that she was diagnosed and would be having some kind of surgery early January. We found out early this month that the surgery isn't happening because the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, her bones, and her liver. The treatment plan is chemo for now.

They live ~5hrs away from us, and his parents said that they weren't even planning on telling their children because they don't want them to worry or rush home. This makes me nervous that they aren't giving us much information, and may withhold information going forward to downplay the severity of the situation.

From what I understand, the spreading makes this stage IV metastatic breast cancer, which seems quite serious. I know I don't have much information to offer, and each case is going to be unique, but I was hoping that someone here could give me some more understanding.

If chemo is the treatment, I assume they start that almost immediately? What kind of timeline does this normally follow? How long until she will be experiencing side effects? How long until they can see if the chemo is working or not? If we are worried they may be withholding information, I think it would be best to go visit and see in person, but I'm not sure when the best time would be. Any information or perspective would be greatly appreciated."
bc,"Hi everyone. I am writing this looking for advise. My wife is 35 and was diagnosed in June of 2017 with stage 4 breast cancer with metastasis in her bones, liver and lungs. She was triple positive so finished her first 7 rounds of chemotherapy and was on herceptin and perjeta.

It seemed to be working but a couple days ago she started acting very confused and disoriented. Took her to the hospital and they did a brain CT and found it had metastasized to the brain. Doctor said because there were so many they would like to do whole brain radiation. 

I am concerned because she was barely able to sign her name on the consent form and from hearing the side effects , memory issues are a major one. The doctor said this could potentially slow the growth for a few months. I am just worried that the cons outweigh the pros of this treatment and I will be stealing the last few good months she has with me and our children away.

Sorry for the wall of text. I am just lost and looking for words from people who have gone through this or had loved ones go through this treatment."

Hello everyone, I've had these spots covering my breasts for as long as I remember. There isn't any pain and they don't feel any different from the rest of my skin, so I never paid them much attention. I have read that spots like these could be a symptom of breast cancer or just a minor skin condition.

If anyone has some insight as to what these spots are, I would very much appreciate it. I know the best advice is to go see a doctor, but I'm unable to do so in the short term. Also I apologize if this is the wrong sub to post in, and if so I'd like to be pointed in the right direction. 

Thanks!"
bc,"Just found out after having core biopsy, Axillary lymph node biopsy and MRI.

I know the tumor is 3.5cm at its widest. The lymph node is negative (clean no cancer thank god) and the cancer had not spread beyond my left breast. During the biopsy some clips were placed in the mass to guide the surgeon during lumpectomy. 

The tumor is strongly estrogen and progesterone positive. It’s HER negative. Ki-67 is. 7% (meaning the tumor is slow growing).

I had genetic testing done and will have results for the most common cancer genes within 15 days. 

Right now my surgeon had told me my surgical options are lumpectomy w/ radiation or mastectomy w/our radiation. I will also have hormonal therapy after surgery. It doesn’t seem, right now, that I will need chemo (but that may change after surgery). they will also do sentinel node biopsy to confirm there is no cancer in the lymph node (even though the suspicious axillary node biopsy came back negative). I am leaning toward lumpectomy but my decision may change depending on my genetic testing results. 

I am scheduled to have a surgical consult with my breast surgeon and plastic surgeon in two weeks. In either case of lumpectomy or mastectomy I will have the plastic surgeon there during my operation for immediate reconstruction.

This is very scary and I have not told my family yet. I am just thankful that the cancer is contained to to the left breast. 

I just needed to share. Thank you for reading. If you pray please pray for me. If you don’t please send positive thoughts. 

Has anyone else dealt with lobular carcinoma or had breast cancer at a young age??"

bc,"Edit: thank you in advance for reading this and commenting. 🙏

My mom (54) felt something under her armpit right breast. Went in for mammogram couple weeks later. Doctors saw a tumor approximately 1.4 cm they said. They ordered a biopsy right away. After a week doctor called my mother and broke the horrible news to her. The tumor is hormone positive (estrogen and progesterone positive). Also the lymph node was cancerous as well. Days later we met with the oncologist and she said that doctor told her at the time of the biopsy he felt tumor was bigger than 1.4 cm. It's more like 4-5 cm... They performed a CT scan and bone scan to check if it has spreaded anywhere else. My whole family and I are all in fear, although I'm trying to keep everyone positive and worry free but it's still pretty hard on us because it's first in family... We have a meeting with doctor and oncologist this week. I want to be prepared and ask the right questions such as treatments and questions about this cancer in general. Im willing to do anything to help out my mom. I started researching all kinds of different diets... (Alkaline, low asparagine diets...) She's not overweight or anything but like I said any help I can provide for her and help her beat this!! Please help me, help her!! 

Update: 02/25/18 // The oncologist called us and said that according to the CT scan, everything looks clear (Thank God) but the bone test showed one suspecious area (left iliac pelvis). Oncologist recommended MRI just to double check on that. She also hinted that the doctor would like to start with hormone pill therapy to shrink the tumor for about 3-6 months then surgery and remove it.

bc,I've had pain and a lumpier feeling area in one breast off and on for a few months. I had a mammogram 2 weeks ago and it came back normal. It did show calcifications and two benign areas. At the time the pain wasn't present but was told to call if it came back. The pain returned and so I called yesterday. They want to schedule a surgical consultation. Does anyone know why they wouldn't want to so an ultrasound before a surgical consultation? Age 38. Thank you!
bc,"So, I’m breastfeeding and my daughter is 11 months. My family has a history of breast cancer but I don’t have the gene.

It feels very uncomfortable just touching the side or sleeping on it. Would breast cancer symptoms start that suddenly? Got quite paranoid....."
bc,"Incompetent office staff
Is it just me or do doctors offices seem to be staffed by incompetent or just uncaring staff these days.  I know I""m generalizing and there are exceptions, but we have not been doing well lately.  

My wife has stage IV metastatic breast cancer that has spread to six vertebrae, her right hip, and her liver.  She has been given a terminal diagnosis and are just buying time.  We like her oncologist, but the staff are really starting to piss me off.  I just had to read them the riot act.  For the fourth time in the last few months we have called in because of issues she's been having.   Dizziness, fever, whatever.  We have to leave a message around 9am because they are so busy.  Then the nurse does not listen to the messages till after 5pm when it's too late to do anything.  They MAYBE call us back the next day anywhere from 9 am to 5pm and say they will talk to the doctor.  Then nothing.  This is bullshit.  We called on Tuesday and left a message.  We called back on Wednesday and they said they would talk to the doctor.  We called back on Thursday and had to leave another message, but heard nothing.  This morning I started blowing up their phones at 9am.  A nurse and a office manager were informed of just how annoyed I was and how unacceptable this was.

If you work for a oncologist anything less than your first rate ""A"" game is unacceptable.   If I don't do my job for 48 hours you won't have your email.  If they don't do their job for 48 hours someone could die.   If I call in because my on chemo cancer patient wife is running a low grade fever this is not something you can put off for 3 to 5 days.  Twenty four hours is the MOST I would find acceptable.   It could be nothing, or it could kill her."

heya guys, can’t seem to find any images online that look like what she has. we’re going to the doctor in the next couple days but it seems to be panic attack after panic attack. 
she’s 22 and in good health, but with very possible PCOS that is getting a checkup. 
it’s a small, pea sized bump on her breast, left side, near the armpit. it’s red bc she’s tried to squeeze it to see if it’s a cyst, which she gets often in other places around. it seems hard, and almost rooted in. she can move it, it’s just ... there. can not find any similar pictures online. 
NO PAIN, no swelling, no other symptoms except it being there. it’s been over 6 months since it’s appeared with no changes. could it be a cyst or something else? will update when we go to the docs but i just wanna give her some semblance of peace from people who’ve gone through this. don’t know if this post is ok to make, but god we appreciate it if you have any information. thank you"
bc,"Ann Silberman of ""Breast Cancer? But Doctor...I hate pink!"" has created a petition in an effort to get more funding to research for better treatments, even possibly a cure, for Stage IV Metastatic Breast Cancer, which she and I both have, along with over 155,000 women and men in the United States alone. We have enough awareness for BC (maybe even too much - it's been normalized to the point where it's viewed as a rite of pink, easy, beatable passage complete with free boob jobs) She needs a minimum of 10,000 signatures to even begin to get Komen's attention. We're halfway there. If you haven't signed, will you consider doing so? If you've signed, will you share? If you've already shared, please share again, on social media, with your friends, your family, your classmates, your coworkers, your church members, even just vote this post up. Please.

The pink ribbon industry rakes in billions of dollars a year, and of all that money, only a mere 2-7% is currently alloted toward research. We need research funding for better treatments, or even any real hope for a cure. One woman out of 8 will get breast cancer. Of those women, one out of three will develop metastatic disease. No one knows who will, or why the women who do get it when others do not. There are at least 18 different different subtypes of breast cancer, and not all of them respond to the current known conventional therapies very well.

I've written a blog entry about the petition, and the statistics, and the reasons why this is so important. You're welcome to share this link as well, or just Ann's link. It doesn't matter, just as long as the petition gets into the hands of at least 10,000 people who can and will sign it. 40,000 women and men die of MBC each year. Some of the people who've signed might not even be alive any longer by the time we've reached our goal. We haven't made any real progress toward a cure since breast cancer awareness started in Betty Ford's day. This needs to change if any of us, early stagers and metsters alike, are to have any real hope for a cure.

bc,"My mom (61 years old) has breast cancer stage 1 (very localized and small and the closest lymph nodes were all free of it). She has to continue with radiation therapy for several weeks. What already bothers her very much is that she has to take Letrozol. She cannot sleep more than 2 hours since weeks. Almost all described side effects she has. Before her breast cancer she was already diagnosed with Osteoposis (weaker form of Osteoporosis), Letrozol seems to make this even worse. She likes to stop eating this pills, what I understand. I tried to get an idea about how good Letrozol is. 

There is e.g. this study:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14551341?dopt=Abstract

There are several things I found a bit worrying.

- Compared to Tamoxifen it's 5% - 6% better, and this seemed so amazing to them that they told the other patients and quite a few switched over to Letrozol.
- What I'm missing is a comparison to a Placebo (no Tamoxifen at first). I assume this would be unethical.
- I miss a comparison to a group which never took Tamoxifen or Letrozol to see what the difference is (or to write it differently, that if all females just would eat Letrozol there would be a lower rate of first time breast cancer patients).

I just would be interested if someone else went through this and stopped to take Letrozol, what their reasoning was and what alternatives they were thinking about (TCM, diet, ...)"

bc,"Hi,

I'm 42(f). ~6 wks ago I noticed my left breast was itchy in one spot like a mosquito bite. The itchiness persisted. Yesterday, I noticed I had a small rash and the itchy area was red and thickened. Today, I noticed my affected breast feels heavy, swollen, and hot. I noticed today my affected breast is bulging out the side of my bra and my husband told me my affected breast looks swollen toward my midline. 

Today, I went to urgent care. The doctor diagnosed a rash, prescribed  a steroid cream, ordered a mammogram and ultrasound for tomorrow, told me to contact my obgyn tomorrow first thing and book an appt ASAP; and, keep an eye on the rash. If my rash is fungal, she said, the steroid cream will make it spread, if it clears, it's dermatitis, if nothing changes, let's see but get my exams and appts done. 

The cream is helping the itch but my boob still feels hot, and I'm anxious.

I found a dry spot by my nipple on Wednesday. I decided to keep an eye on it. Friday I got out of the shower and noticed it looked a bit drier. So I put some coconut oil on my breast and then felt two lumps. 


One was smaller and toward the bottem, it's already gone away. The other one is towards the top, it just feels like denser breast tissue but has a round shape. Less then two inches. It's very sore. 


I only have an A cup. I lost a lot of weight so I have very saggy breasts. I looked at a two week old picture of my breasts and there is a noticeable difference. My breast looks perky now. 


My fiance doesn't like talking about it. I asked him to check, and he squeezed the crap out of my boobs. But he also felt the lump.

bc,"Hi,

Was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer in summer of this year. Have two forms of cancer and am almost finished with first round of heavy chemo. 
Lost my hair-there’s just no way to prepare yourself for it and I opted to shave it off before I began to look like something out of the Walking Dead. Well, didn’t succeed there and call myself a mutant naked mole rat these days. 
The chemo is brutal and have had some seriously vile side effects. Almost died from perjeta, one of the original chemist administered so oncologists had to take that off my chemo cocktail. Eating and drinking are a challenge, feel weak and nauseous most of the time, and am scheduled for a bilateral mastectomy on January 24th of next year. My last big chemo session is December 21 and I need a month to recover from each session. 
Despite the odds, allergies, need to take antibiotics and steroids so the chemo side effects don’t cripple me, am feeling positive that am going to beat this strange and painful journey:)
Am not a spring chick but am not headed into a septuagenarian  paradise either. One of the best aids in fighting cancer, is how you view it. There’s no sense in being depressed or crying because it won’t help and it only hurts you and healing. 
Don’t drink or smoke and live a healthy life and still got walloped with this silent intruder. Cancer doesn’t pick people, there’s no bad or good karma related to this, it just happens. Have another year of chemo to go after surgery and not next year but the year after, I should be a-ok:)

bc,"Hello, quick intro: 30 years old, my mom died of breast cancer at 48 (pre-menopausal) and her aunt has had it twice. I have not had the genetic testing done.

I have a lump in my left breast that has been hurting on and off for a couple months. I first noticed it after randomly decided to self exam, but I had no pain there until the day after I felt it examining myself. Now it hurts every so often, some days much more than others. I can't time it with my cycle as my Nexplanon makes it very irregular.

I went to my primary doctor, she felt what I felt and with my family history, sent me for an ultrasound. $250 later, they said there was nothing concerning on the ultrasound. But the past few days it is hurting much more again and still very much a big palpable lump in my breast.

People who have had it, or who know much about breasts and the different lumps that may occur-- Do you think I should relax and trust the ultrasound results? Or should I try to have someone check it out again? It is my biggest fear to leave my daughter the way my mother had to leave my life, so it is hard for my to accept that I am fine with this nagging pain in my breast.

I know she needs me right now so I'm just looking to do anything I can from far away. She is unsure of what treatment she will choose so I know that may alter what the answer may be but..

I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations of products, such as food, cooking, snacks, drinks, beauty, and cleaning supplies that I can send to her. She lives in Pennsylvania and her town has no Whole Foods or Trader Joes and I'm in Los Angeles so I have access to these places and want to keep her in good supply of healthy things and good treats to make her day a little brighter. I was thinking of coconut oil, chia and flax seeds, some toms deodorant,  but Im really unsure snd in the dark about a lot I've been researching but I'm sure first hand experience is he best form of knowledge so would really love some input and advice and suggestions. Thank you."
bc,"Cancer treatment and hearing loss
I think this is the first time I've ever posted on reddit? But I wanted some input from this community.

I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer at the age of 24 and my treatment consisted of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. I was then put on Tamoxifen for the next five years. At this point, I've been taking tamoxifen daily for just over two years. Anyway, on to the point of this post:

**I am very curious to know if anyone else has noticed hearing problems either during or after treatment?**

For a little over a year, I've noticed that I have a very hard time hearing people talk. A *very* hard time. I've sort of had this problem for a while: back in high school, I realized that I couldn't really hear what people were saying without my glasses because I apparently read lips a lot lol. This recent struggling is notably different, though, because I've been having to ask people to repeat themselves over and over, sometimes up to four times when I'm just sitting a few feet away from them, with my glasses on. I think when this was a problem around family it was easy to dismiss as nothing, but now that I've finally started working again (for the first time since being diagnosed), I've realized *just* how bad my hearing really is.

There are two other things that alarmed me about my hearing: my headphone use and the volume I use.

My whole life, I've been obsessed with music and that eventually turned into an obsession with headphones. I might have been behind on rent, but I always had at least two pairs of *good* headphones, in-ear and over-ear. I could (and did!) yak on and on about headphones and audio quality for an uncomfortable amount of time. I used to wear my over-ear headphones like a necklace, I couldn't be spotted without a pair for *years.*

And **in the last year, I haven't touched my headphones. I use speakers for everything now--and the volume that I use them at is *really* goddamn loud.**

I used to hate watching or listening to anything on speakers as opposed to headphones and whenever I did, it was always on a relatively low setting. I was sometimes impossible to watch TV with because I always felt the volume was way too high whereas others thought I kept it way too low. And now *I'm* the one with the TV blasting. I didn't notice that until a few months ago, when I kept raising the volume on my TV every few seconds for a few minutes and I finally realized how unnatural that was for me.

Anyway, I provide all this background only because I hope to make it clear that I didn't just spook myself after reading a few articles online. However, I did find a study indicating hearing loss may be worsened by tamoxifen, thus my curiosity peaked. Well... calling it curiosity is kind of sugarcoating it. **To be honest, I had a small breakdown because it just feels like no matter how good you might feel in general, every other month, you keep discovering these new side effects or symptoms or you realize you're *not* back at your full strength after all and... it just makes you feel helpless, like it'll never be over.** The treatment process already took so much from me at this age.. does it really have to take my hearing, too?

**TL;DR** - Fielding the breast cancer reddit community for anecdotes about any hearing loss experienced during or after treatment. I have a feeling it's more common than people know but not really noticed because it's kind of difficult to realize you're suffering from it. If the food you're eating tastes bland, you assume it's the food and not your tastebuds, you know? Not to mention older patients might just assume it's age, younger patients might assume it's related to headphones--which, by the way, this is something I totally acknowledge might be my problem. The reason I think it isn't my headphone use is because I distinctly remember that I originally lessened my headphone usage *during* chemotherapy. And I haven't even mentioned the constant pressure and occasional onsets of sharp pain I've felt in my ears for over a year now.

Anyway, I'm due for an appointment with an ENT doctor next week, I will be sure to update this post then.

bc,"Hey there!

I hope everyone is doing as good as possible.

This is a bit detailed, but I needed to get it off my chest. 

I'm a 23 year old woman and I know it's statistically rare for me to get breast cancer, I'm still worried. As far as I know, my family history extends to: dad died of lung cancer last year, one great grandmother of ovarian cancer, one great grandfather of stomach cancer. There's probably other cancers in my history that I don't know about.

In January I observed that my left armpit was swollen. I didn't have a definite lump on the armpit (Google Images showed me how a swollen lymph node should look like) but it felt and looked swollen or fatter than my right armpit. I had discomfort and pain in my left armpit and breast for two weeks (granted, it could have been hormonal because since February my periods are messed up). I still have discomfort, but pain comes and goes every couple of days. It was either a pain like when you pull a muscle or a burning sensation. I also observed my left breast felt a little fuller, a little bigger and my areola skin looked all wrinkly. More on my left breast than my right breast.

I've never been to a doctor to physically examine my breasts, but I decided to get a ultrasound in February. My appointment wasn't quite what I expected. The ultrasound was alright albeit a bit rough. At one point, in my left breast, my doctor went over some sort of lump but he didn't say anything so I assumed it was breast tissue. That lump was painful and when he went over it, it felt like when you go over a bump in the road. He focused on it but said nothing.

The doctor told me both of my armpit lymph nodes are reactive but other than that I look perfectly healthy.

On my (quite short and a bit uninformative) report it says that 1) I have reactive lymph nodes in both of my armpits 2) my BIRADS is 1 3) ""No suspicious lesions for mammary neoplasia detected"" (may sound weird as I translated) and 4) Yearly ultrasounds recommended. He gave me a gel with ibuprofen for the pain and sent me off.

I looked up reactive lymph nodes and found out that they're caused by infection, chronic illness such as HIV or cancer (breast, lung or lymphoma), but if it's a common infection, the swelling of lymph nodes should go down in a month. I was shocked that the doctor sent me off, despite my reactive lymph nodes. 

I did have a long time infection, but it is obviously unrelated. A tooth on the /right/ side of my mouth was infected. I even got antibiotic treatment for it in February and it had no effect on the swollen lymph node. This was after I went to the ultrasound otherwise I would have mentioned this to the doctor.

Anyhow.. it's 24 March and my left armpit lymph node is still swollen and causing me some trouble. Breast pain comes and goes every few days and gets worse when touched, but I mostly have discomfort in my whole arm which sometimes aches or pulsates or tingles. Sometimes I feel like my left arm is weakened in compared to my right arm. 

I also have (but I have had them for a long time so I didn't make any connections at first) two visible veins on the side of my left breast.

I'm planning to do the ultrasound again at another clinic. I'm always stressing about this because I suffer from Anxiety which has focused on Health Anxiety lately. 

Someone told me lymph nodes can take longer than a month to go back to normal and that helped easy my worries a bit, but I still have no idea what caused them. No injury to the arm or anything.

I will probably go for another ultrasound in either April or May."
bc,"(19 F) Found a grape sized lump right under my nipple...cancer risk?
About four years ago at the age of fifteen, I had a mobile, kidney bean sized lump in my right breast, directly underneath the skin of my right nipple that went away within a couple of weeks after I had my period. I researched the crap out of it and my findings indicated that if it goes away after a period and doesn’t come back, it’s just a hormonal issue and is nothing to worry about. Fast forward to today, I found a grape-sized, oval shaped lump in the same exact location. It’s smooth, firm, and rubbery feeling— feels exactly like a grape is under my skin and is very mobile. I don’t have any of the “classic” BC symptoms that pop up when you google it— just the lump. I don’t know if it spontaneously reappeared out of nowhere or had been growing for a while without me noticing, so naturally I panicked. I have no family history of breast cancer, nor have I ever heard of a 19 year old having breast cancer, but I’m still scared. I know the internet’s not the place for proper medical advice but I just lost my health insurance recently and I don’t know what to do. Any advice at all will be greatly appreciated"
bc,"Hello, I am new here so sorry if I am doing this wrong.

I'm looking for comfort, advice and guidance.

Back in 2013, my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer, shortly before her 50th birthday. She had a mastectomy and started chemo. She was given the all clear the following year.

Then, in early 2016, she was diagnosed with a different type of breast cancer. She had another mastectomy and started hormonal treatment. 

2016 was a bad year for her. She had a lot of pain in her ribs and I kept taking her to A&amp;E and they fobbed her off each time saying it is probably from coughing. She ended up with a kidney infection and was hospitalised. When she was released the doctor told her that her kidney was clear and nothing else was wrong. The rib pain persisted throughout the year and in January 2017 she had scans after complaining for so long. The results were not welcome. She now had metastatic cancer in her ribs and spine and there were unknown masses in her lungs, liver, kidney and spleen. She started more treatment (radiotherapy) and things seemed to be going okay. The masses in her organs and spine disappeared, the ribs stopped growing. Toward the end of 2017, she started getting pain in her hip but thought it felt muscular, rather than bone pain. 

Two weeks ago, the pain became a lot worse and she fell over at work because of it. She had scans as they thought she may have broken something. This was not the case. We had the results today and the cancer has spread. Now it's in her hips, the ribs has spread and it is back in her lungs. We found this out today.

She started a new injection today, which was only approved by medical boards last month in the UK. We have to wait three months for a new scan to see if it is helping. If not, then back to chemo we go.

I am at an absolute loss of what to do, how to feel or what to think.

She is my best friend. The reality that I might lose her in the near future has hit me hard and it feels like my world is crashing around me.

What can I do to make her feel more comfortable / brighten her days? What do I say? How do I cope? 

I'm sorry for the essay. I don't feel like I can talk to someone in my real life. Saying it out loud is so final."
bc,"I was diagnosed with stage 3 IDC about a month ago. I have started chemo (DD AC-T) and I will have my last chemo session in May. My tumour is quite large, and my doctor has let me know that even if the adjuvant chemo is very effective, due to the cancer affecting the skin on my breast, a mastectomy is essentially guaranteed. 

I am fairly large chested (I wear a 36DDD) and regardless of the type of reconstruction I receive, my unaffected breast will need to be reduced. My question is: should I opt for a single mastectomy combined with reconstruction/reduction, or instead have a double mastectomy in hopes of a more symmetrical reconstruction? 

I’ve never been particularly fond of my breasts. They’re large and they swell for days before I get my period and my nipples are annoyingly sensitive. I am childfree, so I’ll never need to breastfeed anything. Given my lack of attachment (metaphorically!) to my breasts, which option is likely to give me the most symmetrical/aesthetically pleasing  results? I’ve looked for pictures of results of both approaches online, but I was hoping to get some personal experiences as well. My doctor is leaning more towards a single mastectomy combined with DIEP flap, but I’m just not sure I’ll like the results. 

Has anyone else faced this choice?"
bc,"I’m 21F and I’ve been freaking out for the past few days wondering if I should go to the doctor. I’ve always had one breast larger than the other and, on the larger breast, I noticed that I have this reddish discolouration (about the size of two-three fingers above my nipple) that comes and goes. It’s not a solid/consistent shape, it’s more like spots in one area. It seems to appear when I get out of a hot shower or when I’m cold and then completely goes away. It isn’t itchy or painful. I haven’t felt any lumps or noticed any other symptoms that I’ve read about online. I do have pain in my breasts on occasion, but I’m not sure if it’s due to my birth control pills - I know it’s a common symptom. I also sometimes get random small pimples (pea sized or smaller) on or around my breast area, which go away after a week or two. I’m not sure if I’m worried for nothing or if I should go see a doctor. I know the chances of having breast cancer at my age are very small, but I can’t help but freak out. There’s also no history of breast cancer in my family. 

Any advice or thoughts? Where do you even go to get checked for this? I’m from Canada - more specifically Montreal - and I can’t find any info online, can you just go to any random clinic?"
bc,"Showing symptoms and getting worried...
Hi loves, recently I've noticed some symptoms recently and it's got me worried. 
I do not feel lumps, but both breasts are constantly red and itchy. When I itch them they start to bleed. 
I have a dry patch between my breasts that looks brownish and scaly, and sometimes burns. As for my entire breasts themselves, they do not get sore unless I itch them.

Is this something to worry about or am I just being paranoid about a small problem?"
bc,"I previously posted about this in October 2017 which is when I found out about my mother's diagnosis.

After her second session of chemotherapy she had to have CT and MRI scans and today she found out the results. The doctor told her that cancer had spread to her bones and that she'll have to have injections for it? I don't know what this means and I still don't know if my mother is going to be okay. 

I've read that once cancer spreads to the bones it cannot be cured but it can be treated. 

The doctor also told her that following on in her chemotherapy it will target the cancer in the bones as well as the tumor. She has had five sessions of chemotherapy and her last one is this Thursday. After that she'll have more scans, her operation and radiation therapy. 

Is anyone able to help me to understand this situation better? At the minute i'm assuming the worst.

All replies appreciated. Thank you"
bc,"Two weeks ago, I was diagnosed with (pardon me, still learning the jargon so I'm not sure if this is how I'm supposed to say it...) stage 3 invasive ductal bc.  Estrogen negative, progesterone positive, HER2 postitive.  So far it looks like it hasn't spread to lymph nodes.

And as the title said, I'm 24 weeks pregnant.  I also have a 16 month old boy for me to chase around and make me laugh.

Is there anyone here who has been through a similar situation, who may be able to give me more insight than my doctors have?  I've looked at online ""survival stories"" etc of women who were treated for bc while pregnant, but I would much rather be able to have a dialog with someone about it.

Thanks."
bc,"Young female with family history
Recently I noticed changes in my left breast. I've had lumps before and had an exam many moons ago. There's a knot in my left breast where I also noticed a rash like circle under the breast and nipples are scaly. I looked up those exact symptoms and it lead to breast cancer pages. My aunt (father's sister) died at 35 of breast cancer. I qualified for an early detection program but now they're telling me I can't be seen because I'm not 50+ in age. Yet I have an immediate family member that died from it.... literally makes no sense and having this uncertainty is really messing with my emotions. Can anyone provide information on where I can go to get checked that I can qualify for being a broke joke.. I have absolutely no money to my name and no relationship with my family. Me against the world..... 

Please and thank you in advance for any stranger's kind help!!!!!"
bc,"Just got off the phone with a dear friend who was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ today.  It was caught early but she's obviously overwhelmed with the news and very upset.  Is there anything that someone has said or done along the way that was especially comforting for you?  Or on the flip side, anything I need to be mindful of not saying or doing?  Sort of at a loss."
bc,"My name is Skyler and I'm from the Southwest of the US and originally from German decent. Around six months ago my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer right after her mom died of an pulmonary embolism. We all knew what would happen next. In march of 2016 we traveled from our home in Phoenix to a hospital in Scottsdale nearly an hour and a half away. I remembered staying up all night just being scared about it. About 3-4 hours later, her doctor told us that she ran into it so early that they were able to get it out. Now, at around elevenish, I'm typing this to tell you guys my story."
bc,"Like many posts on here, I am waiting for my ultrasound. I found a small lump two weeks ago while randomly feeling my breasts, and my doctor confirmed it was about 1cm. Told me not to worry, but is sending me for an ultrasound. The breast centre at the hospital near my office is wonderful, but it also means I have to wait until May 25. My doc has booked my results follow up for June 4th so all in all, It'll be a month before I know anything definite!!! 

I am lucky to live in Canada, and Toronto specifically which has amazing  hospitals, but The wait is awful, but I am trying to keep myself busy and active so I don't sit here and think of it. Just wanted to vent my fears in hopes of finding people going through the same waiting game."
bc,"I apologize for the generic post, but I don't want to pound her for details as she's really, really distraught.  A loved one had a mammogram last week, and was called in today to take ""measurements"".  I don't know if this means she has cancer, what type it might be, if it's precautionary, etc.  Can anybody shed light on what I might expect to hear next?"
bc,"Hi everyone! I was hoping to get advice on what's been going on lately with the symptoms I have been experiencing. Hoping to ease my anxiety. First things first, I am a fairly healthy 23 year old woman. For the past two weeks I have been experiencing itchiness around both breasts. I thought it may be due to dry skin but it has not subsided. There are currently no visible changes to my breasts and I don't feel any lumps, which helps me to feel better. However, I just recently started experiencing upper back pain. This pain originates at the middle of my back and radiates to my shoulders. I unfortunately googled my symptoms and first thing that popped up was breast cancer, which caused me to go into immediate panic. I should also mention I do have anxiety and am under stress  so it may play a role in all of this. Although, was just hoping to get some advice from those of you on here. Any advice is appreciated!"
bc,"So my wife has just had her BRCA2 gene confirmed. She's understandably very upset about it (likened it to actually being told she has breast cancer given the 50% lifetime likelihood, and past family history).

She's more drawn to having a double mastectomy / reconstruction (with implants, not flaps) given she feels that it's inevitable that cancer will take her boobs anyway, even if she gets access to extra monitoring due to being high risk. 

Admittedly she's having a really rough year. Both our kids were born premmie, and couldn't breastfeed. She feels like she's being completely let down by her body and now this too. She's started seeing a therapist to try and get past the traumatic nature of the births, and it's kinda great timing that she's getting extra support through this as well.

One of the biggest things she's worried about is the role her breasts play in femininity/sexuality - she's ok with how the implants might look, but disappointed she'll lose all feeling there and they won't play the same role anymore. 

Is there any insights the people of r/breastcancer can offer?"

3. How was the cancer initially detected? (i.e. through a BSE, a CBE or an annual
mammogram)
4. How did you feel when you first received the news?
5. Is there a family history of breast cancer?
6. Did you have a support network? If not, how did you overcome it or find it?
7. Tell me about your treatment process.
8. Were there any programs or services offered to you that would help with the treatment
process?

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.   

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part. 

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous.

bc,"Hey guys, I'm in a really weird mindset.  My wife (26) was diagnosed with stage 3 triple negative breast cancer last Friday.

Sadly her mother fought breast cancer twice, and won, but eventually passed away after losing her fight with ovarian cancer.  2 years ago my wife and her sister (23) underwent some genetic testing and discovered that they both have the BRCA1 gene.

Last year her sister had very aggressive stage 3 breast cancer and within a week was rushed in for a double mastectomy an removal of approx 20 lymph nodes.  She has come through her cancer smiling and has had a double reconstruction.

So my wife is now in having a lumpectomy and removal of central lymph nodes.  My weird mindset is coming from the fact she has been acting totally nonchalant about the whole situation.  She has expected this to happen for a while now, she has just accepted it and just moving on with everything.

I have never experienced anything like this and it's all very overwhelming, I'm sort of quietly freaking out, not really letting her know but I'm not really as strong as her.  She's a trooper and is constantly asking how I'm doing throughout this whole thing.

It's frustrating me that she is so calm and I'm the one freaking out when I'm not the one going through this =(  Is this normal?  Do I just need to toughen up?  Can anyone offer any advice for my wife or myself?"

I wish I had never been suckered into treatment and surgery I did not want and should never have had. I should be dead. And i'm fucking sick of all the cheerful pink bullying and the willful dismissal of women's sexuality by every single cancer doctor on the planet, not to mention all the bullshit self-satisfying lies from people who are relieved it wasn't them saying how 'beautiful' breast cancer freaks are. We are mutilated, ugly, and sexless. And if we have to cheerful positive pink spin to put on the disgusting horror that is the reality of this disease, nobody wants to hear it. Every fucking doctor I've ever met was offended by my complete lack of fawning gratitude for having been reduced to a mutilated sexless science experiment. Do not ever trust a doctor. Make them tell you exactly how ugly and disgusting they will make you. Insist upon seeing pictures. Look them in the eye and force them to tell you what it will do to your body and your sex life. Force them to say that 'reconstruction' is nothing but a hideous lump of numb plastic under the skin, not a breast with feeling.

I understand the need to suppress those hormones but the thing is Ive had my tubes tied for twenty years. Why dont they just take my ovaries out and then Id be done?

bc,"I'll preface this by giving a little background on my girlfriends previous bouts with cancer. She's had bone cancer twice, both in the same location in her jaw. The first occurrence was when she was 21 and the second time around 24. Both times she underwent chemo and the second time they gave her a LOT of radiation so that they were sure it wouldn't come back... she can't even have a CT scan at this point.

I felt a lump in her breast about a month ago, and after a lot of prodding and begging convinced her to get it checked out. She went for an ultrasound last week, and at her follow up yesterday they told her they'll need to do a biopsy.

At this point, I don't think that she has a whole lot of optimism, especially given her medical history. I try to help her see the silver lining sometimes, but sometimes I just lay with her and try to be there for her.

There's really nothing we can know until the biopsy (should be scheduled within the next 10 days) but what I'd love to have is some ammo [i.e. positive information re: biopsy incidences, personal stories of overcoming, etc] so that I can help her be cautiously optimistic as she goes through this. 

I'm starting to prepare myself for the potential journey ahead - I know that she feels defeated already and having been through two bouts with cancer she sometimes feels like giving up. But I won't let her. And if you guys can maybe come up with some reasons to help her along this path that would be amazing.

tldr; gf (former bone cancer survivor) had ultrasound on breast lump, needs to go back for biopsy, looking for reasons for optimism"

bc,"Early signs of breastcancer or related
I'm dealing with a harmless looking pain under my armpit for more than 8 months, one doctor checked it by hand and in that day it wasn't painful so the doctor said it's nothing.
Few months later I occasionally had a stinging pain under my armpit and a bump, is this already an alarm? 
Would like to hear similar experience
I'm planning to go to different doctor and ask for ultrasound and mammogram"
bc,"I had a mammogram a week ago. A day later they told me I needed to come back in for additional screening on my right breast. 

I went in today for another mammogram and an ultrasound. They told me that they saw a dense area of my breast, but could not duplicate the finding on the ultrasound.

On my discharge paperwork, they checked the box that says, “Probably not cancer” and come back in 6 months so we can check again. Um...so I have to wait 6 months if I have it or not? And if it is, what about the possibility of it spreading?

Am I freaking myself out or should I insist on a second opinion?

Thank you in advance for your advice!"
bc,"My wife had breast cancer last year, got dbl mastectomy, went through chemo and started radiation the other week. Just today she found out her thyroid is 'in the field' aka getting blasted by radiation. What are the risks, what should we watch for?
(Google is useless, only info I can find is on imrt to treat thyroid cancer) 

Any links or info is greatly appreciated! 

We're waiting to hear back from the Dr (and a little pissed they didn't say anything sooner)"
bc,"My mom was diagnosed with cancer about 4 years ago at stage 4, metastatic cancer. There were always up and down days ever since then. Some days she'd be fine, and others she'd be feeling really weak and tired. But recently is been a month or so, but she's been bedridden and they found that the cancer had spread to her liver and that there is a tumor near her eyes which makes it hard for her to see. She's been in the hospital for a couple of days now and they said they'll be starting radiation soon, however, they say her chances of survival might be a couple of months which is scaring me. I'm in general a very sensitive person, but I have no idea how I'm going to deal with the idea that I'll have to live the rest of my life without my mom and I'm only 21. That possible reality is just something I can't grasp, but at the same time I think she's had enough pain to go through in the past couple of years that it would be easy on her so that she wouldn't have to suffer anymore. I'm sorry for making this post so long, but it's just really a scary thought and I have no idea how to deal with it."
bc,"Still in the information gathering stage - but so far I know that it’s invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3 (stage TBD but no less than 2, due to size of tumor at 2cm).  No family history, no risk factors.

I’m ready for more information on the cancer and my options for treatment. Definitely feeling a little scared, but mostly just ready to start getting past this."
bc,"So I'm just writing so that maybe I can get some feed back while I wait. About 3 weeks ago I found a lump on the side of my right breast. I have implants but they're new, couldn't see them leaking already. But it's so hard to control my brain. I have a mammogram and ultrasound in a week. And I go back and forth on whether I'm being a hypocondract or that this is something and I'm scared. I'm worried that maybe my implants will make it hard to diagnose, or that they are the implants and I'm making a big stink out of nothing. I'm just scared in general and all this waiting is making it difficult."

Hello current Breast Cancer patients and survivors of Reddit. I have a few questions about breast forms and prosthetics  and hoped I might have your help/opinions and advice.

bc,"Has anyone here taken Kadcyla? What were your experiences? 

My mom was recently diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer for the second time in 3 years (HER2+). In 2015 she had a left radical, radiation, and chemo consisting of doxepin, carboplatin, and herceptin. Once she was done with treatment they didn't re-scan her. I don't remember the reasoning behind this...I was in nursing school at the time and what they said didn't really make sense to me. Now, 3 years later, the same cancer has come back.  They didn't get all of it. It only spread to the lymph nodes in her chest thankfully. 

Last Thursday was her first dose of Kadcyla and she is still absolutely miserable. It hit her so hard that night. I don't remember it being like this last time. I live in a different state than they do and was only there until Thursdsy night. I had a panic attack when we were saying goodbye I did not want to leave her. Its now Monday morning and shes still wiped from it. She had a low grade fever until about Friday afternoon. But she can't eat. Diarrhea. Says she has lost about 10 lbs. Head hurts, throat hurts, chest hurts. 

I know every drug is different and every person is affected differently. I'm a surgical nurse so I don't have much experience with cancer. But its definitely one thing to battle through ilness with my patients. It's completely different with a parent. 

Sorry for the long post. Any advice/experiences shared would be greatly appreciated!"

These are the post-surgery test results:

* RX at abdomen: negative 

* bone scintigraphy: negative 

* lymphnodes (checked during surgery): negative

It seems everything is fine now. She stayed there for a week or so because she had to wait for the liquids to drain away from the tissues. I called her few minutes ago and she said she'll get out today. They already removed the drain syringe and they just have to fill out some papers. Now she just has to do some checks every once in a while.

bc,"Hello all,

I had a sort of red mark on my breast a few days ago, and a lump. I decided I should get it checked out, particularly since I’ve had some nipple discharge (yellow brownish) and some weird changes in my period and a family history plus some risk factors. My doctor swabbed the fluid and ordered an ultrasound which I’ve now had. It’s not fluid filled like a cyst or abscess but the radiologist said he thought that although there was heterogeneity in the lump he still thought it was most likely a fibroadenoma but that I need to follow up with a clinician who deals specifically with “lumps and bumps.” Ultimately I was told to wait for the formal report Tuesday. I missed a call a few hours after the ultrasound from my primary care doctor; I’m assuming, in my nervous mind, that the swab wasn’t bacterial and instead was for cytology and she has the results. Left voicemail asking that I call the office but it was too late to call back. I’m just still nervous despite the radiologist’s comment. Anyone have a similar experience?"
bc,"Hello, I am 36, from NB, Canada and I was diagnosed oct 06, 2017 with infilitrating ductal carcinoma intermediate grade with metastaic carcinoma on the lymph nodes. Er&amp;pr neg. Her2/neu +

I turn 36 aug 09. Aug 10 I started having pain shooting from my armpit to my left nipple. It felt like a blocked duct. I thought it was a pinched nerve or a reaction to a progesterone only bc I had tried and then stopped using after it messed up my cycle.  I felt nothing at the time and went about my weekend. I had a breast exam done in may because I had seen a spot that looked different on the underside of the breast that was now hurting and was told I have typical breast cysts seen in women my age. 

About a week or so later I started to feel a pea sized lump. At the end of august I went back to my doctor as the lump had grown and the pain was still there. She couldn't feel it doing a regular breast exam. I had to show her how to find it by basically squeezing my breast and pushing down. As soon as she felt it her face changed. She ordered a mammogram and ultrasound and on sept 09 I went for these tests. 

I knew going into her office in august it was cancer, I just knew. The day of the mammogram I seen the last image the tech had taken of me still on the screen and I seen this large white glowing spot. It reminded me of a dandy lion that had went to seed and was being blown away by the wind. I have spent a lot of time reading and looking at medical related things in my life. I am currently studying to be a med. Lab asst. And I knew exactly what I was looking at. I knew it wasn't a simple cyst. Cysts are smooth, round and even typically. This had uneven edges and was spread out. It looked like it had tendrels branching out. I spent the next 45 minutes watching this invader on the ultrasound screen.  

I was called days later and told I was being sent for a core needle biopsy under ultrasound and would be seen at the breast health clinic. I had the consultation with the BHC. And by this point I could see an indent on the underside of my breast where the spot I had been concerned about in may use to be. 

I went for the biopsy. They start with the ultrasound then the doctor came in and said we are biopsying the breast but also the armpit. My heart sank. At this point I knew it was cancer even though no one would say it and was hoping it wasn't in my lymph nodes. 

Oct 05 I went for an mri and oct 06 was told I had cancer. So the staging process starts tomorrow with a ct scan. A bone scan on tuesday and a muga test friday. This friday I meet my oncologist. I was told I will under go chemo, surgery and radiation. 

So far I have been pretty stable emotionally. I had been prepping for this since august. So the diagnosis wasn't a shock.  I cried because I was right and was hoping beyond hope that I was wrong. I even knew why type it was based on my research. 

I am very much a lets get this started so we can all move on with lives kinda gal. I dont want to be coddled by my health care workers but I do want to know exactly what is going to happen and what my options are. I dont care about my hair or even losing a breast or both. I want to live and raise my boys into men. 

What I am looking for though are connections to others in my area who can help me navigate this system. I want to also speak with someone about cannabis oil/medical marijuana. The breast health nurse stated asked me why i would even be thinking about that today. She said that yes i will lose my hair but other than mild nausea i won't have any other issues such as pain. But this goes against everything I have read and would rather treat the chemo effects as ""naturally"" as possible. 

Anyways thats me and my current situation."

Hello Everyone!

I am a Stage 2 Triple Negative Breast Cancer Survivor and I'm interested in giving speeches and starting in person support groups in my area and would LOVE all the feedback I can get so that I address the cancer topic\(s\)correctly.. I am becoming more and more aware of misconceptions of people that are newly diagnosed, currently in treatment, and are post treatment... If you would be so kind to private message me or comment your answers to the following questions I'd be eternally grateful.

1. What are the top three things that people say to you when the find out that you have cancer that you find/found annoying?
2. What were the top three things that were funny to you \(and maybe nobody else \) during treatment?
3. What are the top three misconceptions people have about you post treatment?
4. And for the caregivers of those that fought the brave battles but didn't make it...what would be the top three things that they would want us to know about their journey.

I realize these topics can and will be uncomfortable to share and I will feel extraordinarily blessed for those that feel that they can.

I want to be able to speak to and advocate for those that don't feel comfortable speaking out but want the message to be shared with those that will appreciate it.

bc,"According to my obgyn and a survey done through the American Cancer Society, I have about a 21% chance of getting breast cancer in my lifetime, with risk factors being that my mom got diagnosed at age 50 and I got my first period at age 11. 

Currently, I'm 35 years old, would like to have a child/ children at some point, but it just hasn't happened yet. I've been on a  birth control pill for 10 years,  I've changed a few times, but the one I was on the longest was a generic of yaz. I've had great results with the pill with regard to keeping my periods regular, reducing PMDD / interaction with diagnosed depression, and contraception. I'm a nonsmoker, healthy eater but overweight (bmi is 35), and have dense breast tissue. 

My question is this... is it worth chucking the pill to lower my cancer risk? Factors to consider: just got out of another failed long term relationship, not sure when I'd start dating again, don't need contraception right now. If I did get into another relationship (and it actually was a good one), I'd want to be moving toward trying to get pregnant... not right away, but hopefully before I turn 40.

Reading up this morning, trying to understand the pathology report and this shit is scary. 

That tit has always had a lazy, unresponsive nipple. 

I can't recall when I actually found the bump but it eventually turned into a lump. I went for a mammogram on the breast lump back when I was 30 (40's now) and the Dr laughed and made a comment about me being there at 30yrs of age for a lump. 

Serious life shit continued to happen for the next 10 yrs or so and I recently realized how large the lump had grown. 

I meet my Oncologist next week, have an MRI and my port put in to begin chemo.

My mom is nearing 50 and after doing research on the internet and comparing countless images of her mammograms and ultrasounds to other samples, I (of course, hoping for the best) think its just a lump from fibrocystic changes and is not the dreadful breast cancer. However, the hypoechoic mass is quite large and I was wondering if this indicates something terrible. She has an appointment with a doctor coming soon but I'd like to calm my own nerves so can anyone please tell me how likely it is that she may possibly have cancer....

Her mammogram shows her right breast to be heterogenously dense while the left isn't. The lump is also in her right breast near the upper outer area of her breast. Description from ultrasound states ""Within the 10:00 position, 5cm from the nipple, corresponding to the patient's indicated area of palpable abnormality, note is made of an irregularly shaped hypoechoic mass measing 2.2 x 1.2 x 1.4cm.

bc,"Emotional impact of a cancer diagnosis
Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.   

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part. 

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time.

I was told that my breasts can be categorized as ""extremely dense"" (apparently only 10% of breasts fall into this classification), and how there are greatly increased risks of breast cancer in this situation because the density of the breast tissue can make detection from a normal mammogram very difficult.

I received the all-clear from my radiologist (no cancer found via the normal mammogram). I asked my primary doctor's office if they thought, due to the breast density, I should go back and get a 3D mammogram since it's supposed to be better at detection, and my nurse practitioner said it's not necessary.

But I wanted to get the opinion from you ladies as well, since some of you probably have direct experience in this regard. What do you think? Is it worth it to go back and schedule a 3D mammogram?

I work 7-5 and take turns watching her every couple of nights.   

Nights like tonight make it especially hard.  So I'm asking for help to make our time most valuable.  What would you recommend to make her happy and make lasting memories? 

 I love her and I'm struggling so any help is appreciated.

Thank you"
bc,"Breast reconstruction - implant position?
Folks who have had breast reconstruction: if you don't mind sharing, is/are your implant(s) in front of or behind the pectoral muscle? I'm deciding between two different plastic surgeons, one who prefers the more ""traditional"" method of going behind the muscle, and one who uses what I guess is a newer technique of putting it in front. I'd love to hear about the healing process, complications, appearance, and movement/pain, especially from very active people.

I'm leaning towards the newer technique, but since there's less documentation about it out there I'm hoping to hear from people who have personal experience with it. Thank you!!"
bc,"Male breast cancer??
I'm having a mild anxiety attack, which isn't like me. My wife is soundly sleeping next to me, I don't want to wake her, so I figured I'd post on reddit to find some solace. In our marriage I'm the ""stay calm it will be fine"" one, right now I feel anything but fine.

Over the past two weeks I've noticed a little pain under and to my right side of my nipple. Tonight I did some deep touching and noticed that there is something under the skin, almost oval shaped and slightly flat, maybe 2 inches wide and 1 inch in height. It's fairly soft, and moves around a bit. It's tender not painful. 

I'm 32, male, in decent shape, how does this happen? This is something, even if it's not cancer, something is growing. I'm not sick, I don't have any infections. It's either cancer, a benign tumor, or I'm growing a boob, like and actual boob. 

It definitely makes you rethink life decisions that's for sure. 

TL:DR 
Young male ignored mild pain for two weeks, now there is a something growing under his nipple so he is freaking out because it feels big."
bc,"So the other day I finally went into the doctors to check out this rash on my boob that has grown significantly huge in the past 5 months. They did skin samples and tested negative on fungal, eczema and ringworm. 
...they told me it's out of their field of practice and they referred me to a dermatologist as a priority one; however my appointment isn't til the 7th and i just wanna know wtf is on me and if i should be concerned at all. It burns almost constantly and it stings randomly. 
I matched it up with about 80% of the pics of patients on Google  (I know, HORRIBLE idea and i know being on web MD doesn't make it any better).... but i really am just curious and preparing myself for what's to come... any thoughts or info would be greeeat 👌"
bc,Stage 3 ductile carcinoma. Two tumors the largest is 1.9 cm juxtaposed to a smaller one. What should I know and what is my outlook?
bc,"My mother was recently diagnosed with breast cancer.  When she had her single mastectomy a few weeks ago, they removed 11 lymph nodes - all of them were found to be cancerous.  She will now be starting chemo and radiation.

This all came on very quickly.  She's had clean mammograms for the past 2 years, and went in this year after feeling a lump.  A mammogram showed nothing, so they did an ultrasound.  The ultrasound showed the tumor, and they initially thought the tumor wasn't very large.  At the time of removal, the tumor was 2.9cm.  How does something like that get missed for three years?

We're waiting on her gene test results, and if positive, I will get tested as well.

I am very scared.  I lived 10 minutes from my mom until about 5 months ago.  It's killing me that I'm so far away while she goes through this.  I don't know how to show my support from 900 miles away.  I'm also worried that it's worse than stage 3, though her doctors have diagnosed it as such.  I'm just not ready to lose my mother.

I just had to get this off my chest.  Thanks for letting me vent."

How will they tell if it spread to the lymph nodes if I do chemo before surgery?

bc,"She didn't take it well, looked really scared and worried when she got the news. Family has no history of cancer and she doesn't smoke or drink. Doctor kept reassuring her that it's very early and treatable. Informed her of two options (which I believe are lumpectomy with radiation or mastectomy). 

She has an MRI on her breast scheduled for tomorrow. Not sure what my family can do to help...
Is there a method that's preferred in regards to the surgery? =/"
bc,"So, it is about my mother. She had a breast surgery about a year ago and has recently developed lymphedema on the respective arm. The thing is, it doesn't look too swollen, in comparison with pictures i've seen about lymphedema, but it hurts her so much, she often cannot sleep because of it. She sleeps for like 10-20 min, then she needs help to get up, sit for like 5-10 min only to lie down again. She can move her arm, but it sill hurts. We've consulted a doctor of course, but they gave us some antibiotic to take a few days ago. Anyone here who has gone through something similar? Any advice? Thanks for your help in advance."
bc,"So I went to have an ultrasound and mammogram early September because I had a huge lump in my right breast. Luckily it was just a cyst, they didn't even perform the mammogram after the ultrasound revealed it was a cyst. 

So in the buildup to that appointment I was very concerned and expressed my anxieties to my family and friends. Everyone one told me to calm down that it's ridiculously unlikely that at my age, 27, I would have breast cancer. 

Well now I have some new developments. Since my ultrasound in September the moles on my breasts have roughly doubled. I had maybe 5 small ones on each. Now I have about 10 but the newest ones are very small, almost like someone dotted me with a brown pen. 

The other new development is a painless lump in my right underarm. It's worrying me, because usually I'd have an ingrown hair in the other underarm and it was always very painful. I started exfoliating in both underarms and no longer have to deal with painful ingrown hairs. Now the new painless lump coupled with the moles has me worried. 

I was just wondering if it merits attention or if I should just calm down, since I was just given the all clear in September.

TL;DR:  New painless lump in my right underarm, but ultrasound in September showed nothing but a cyst in my R breast. Also new moles on both breasts."

bc,"Hi I’m 43/f with multiple medical problems. A 1cm tumor was found in my left breast confirmed with ultrasound. Radiologist and Surgeon both agree to believe a fibroadenoma. I insisted on biopsy which was done today due to my years of medical problems, radiation exposure, misdiagnoses, etc. I should receive an answer within 48 hours. How many people were told your tumor was benign and it turned out not to be? I’m cautiously optimistic."

bc,"I'm the girl that burned her house to the ground accidentally during fire prevention week about 30 years ago. Friday I was diagnosed with early breast cancer during breast cancer awareness month...my conversation with the doc was brief, and so I didn't catch the type of cancer. I'll be seeing her in a couple of days so I'll get it again then. I only know that it is a cancer fed by estrogen. The surgery to remove two aggressive cysts was successful, but because of the pathology, the specialist needs to go in and take more tissue out. Before doing that she is going to send me for an MRI to make sure there isn't more than just this. I survived ovarian cancer at 14 years of age due to a cyst the size of a football. That was 42 years ago. I'm not going to lie - I'm scared to death. Any pointers are appreciated in advance."

I recently found a lump in the upper outer quadrant of my breast. I visited my normal doctor and he sent a request for me to get an ultrasound.

There is no evidence of focal solid or cystic lesions. SUMMARY: No localizing findings.""  I talked to my doctor's nurse on the phone this morning and she said the only way they would take the lump out is through a cosmetic procedure which insurance wouldn't cover. I wouldn't normally get a second opinion on anything, but this months menstrual cramps were extremely painful and I usually don't get cramps. Should I go to a different doctor or possibly a gynecologist?"

bc,"I'm 28 and I found a lump on my right breast Saturday and obviously my brain has been on the hamster wheel ever since.

I'm currently breastfeeding and have experienced clogged ducts and mastitis before but this doesn't feel like either. The lump almost feels like its in my muscle and its not able to move. I have no pain associated with it. No family history of BC and no other symptom except for an observation (by the doctor) that my saline implant was more into my armpit than my left. 

The doctor ordered for an ultrasound/other imaging along with biopsy if needed but since I'm breastfeeding I can't get a mammogram.
The waiting game sucks and my brain is going there and it just sucks because I have 2 kids.


UPDATE:
My results finally came back and I have extremely dense breast tissue therefore they could not see anything during the ultrasound. The doctor recommended that I stop breastfeeding and get a mammogram in 3 months after my supply dries up.
I of course read up on extremely dense breast tissue and 3 months just seems too far away"

I need to switch oncologists (mine is costing me a small fortune since he is not in network). Any recommendations for a good oncologist in Houston please?"
bc,"Is it just me or do doctors offices seem to be staffed by incompetent or just uncaring staff these days.  I know I""m generalizing and there are exceptions, but we have not been doing well lately.  

My wife has stage IV metastatic breast cancer that has spread to six vertebrae, her right hip, and her liver.  She has been given a terminal diagnosis and are just buying time.  We like her oncologist, but the staff are really starting to piss me off.  I just had to read them the riot act.  For the fourth time in the last few months we have called in because of issues she's been having.   Dizziness, fever, whatever.  We have to leave a message around 9am because they are so busy.  Then the nurse does not listen to the messages till after 5pm when it's too late to do anything.  They MAYBE call us back the next day anywhere from 9 am to 5pm and say they will talk to the doctor.  Then nothing.  This is bullshit.  We called on Tuesday and left a message.  We called back on Wednesday and they said they would talk to the doctor.  We called back on Thursday and had to leave another message, but heard nothing.  This morning I started blowing up their phones at 9am.  A nurse and a office manager were informed of just how annoyed I was and how unacceptable this was.

If you work for a oncologist anything less than your first rate ""A"" game is unacceptable.   If I don't do my job for 48 hours you won't have your email.  If they don't do their job for 48 hours someone could die.   If I call in because my on chemo cancer patient wife is running a low grade fever this is not something you can put off for 3 to 5 days.  Twenty four hours is the MOST I would find acceptable.   It could be nothing, or it could kill her."
bc,"I'm almost 28, female. I've had a rash on my areola for almost a year. I have eczema, so I'm used to weird skin things. I used my cortisone cream and it didn't help. After several months I was at an urgent care for my asthma. I had them look at it. The doctor told me it wasn't concerning except that it wouldn't go away. She gave me an anti-fungal cream, antibiotics, and steroids. The steroids were for the asthma, but she said it might help. 

It still hadn't gone away a few months later. Thursday I was at urgent care again go my asthma. I brought up the rash to this doctor. She told me not to be alarmed, because it's rare, but breast cancer can present without a lump and just a rash. I told her that my family has a history of cancer, so I was pretty concerned. I guess since my grandpa had pancreatic cancer, and they are the same family of cancers, it increases my chances of breast cancer. 

I googled the hell out of it. The rash matches almost exactly with Pagets. Of course it a highly aggressive and invasive cancer. I have an appointment on Tuesday to see my pcp. I've told my mom and my best friend, but no one else. I'm trying to not freak out. I guess Pagets is really very rare. I feel like I need to talk to someone, but I don't want to burden my best friend, and my mom is a little preoccupied because my grandma is back in the hospital for the third time in as many weeks. 

Waiting for any information until Tuesday seems impossible. Even then, it's just my pcp and he will probably have to refer me elsewhere for answers. I'm a bit terrified. I have an 11 year old daughter, and I don't want her to know unless I'm sure it's cancer, but keeping how upset I am a secret has been hard. Today I blamed migraines...

bc,"Lately I have been feeling a random ache in my left breast. It actually feels kind of like when I was lactating and I’d go too long without nursing, but not quite because that was a kind of pressure and fullness and this feels more like tenderness or like I have a deep bruise. 

Last night I rolled onto that breast while in bed and it felt like I had a bouncy ball in my breast - something hard. I felt my breast and I felt a hard lump deep inside, against the muscle wall. But it’s kind of lumpy in there in general? My right one doesn’t feel lumpy. 

I made an appt for a mammogram and the scheduler seemed concerned when I talked about the pain and lump. She said to get a referral for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound, not a screening mammogram. 

My husband was looking up my symptoms and stumbled upon info about fibrocystic breasts. It seems like it could be that, but I really have no idea.

I don't know if I just didn't catch it the first time, which would be strange since I kept touching the area, or if it's possible that a second one grew within 2 weeks. I am worried that if it is malignant that it will worsen after 6 months.

I do have lumpy, dense breasts. But whenever I google pictures of breast tumor on mammogram, it looks exactly like mine.   


The technician said up to 25% of all first time mammogrammed women are asked to come back for more imaging, just because they don’t have a baseline for what’s “normal for them.” She added “I’m not saying I saw anything on yours, I’m just telling you if they call you back, don’t freak out because it’s very common after your first.”

For the past 2-3 months I've had random subtle pain around my chest/ribs/breasts on both sides but mainly the right side that lasts for a few minutes at most. The pain on the ribs occurs mainly if I apply a little pressure with my fingers. Some day it could be on my breast, some day on the rib, etc. I felt a 'lump' to the right of my right nipple but I'm not sure if its actually a lump or a lymph node cause its theres a string of lumps/nodes all the way to my armpit. I'm not sure if its normal for one to be able to feel their own lymph nodes but I am pretty skinny. 
I also have swollen lymph nodes under my jaw because I need to get a root canal in the near future. I'm not sure if this could somehow affect the nodes near my right arm or if the infection in my tooth is causing the pain.

I have a grape sized lump on my left breast on the inside of my breast. It is solid and it doesn't move or hurt, from my research all of this is bad news. 

I have a consultation with a boob Dr. scheduled for Thursday, they require the consultation before they do the biopsy which is frustrating. I really just want to get to the point and know if it's cancer or not.

I am reaching out to all the people I know to ask for help with getting my Kickstarter campaign noticed and of course funded. I am trying to raise funds so that we can make breast prostheses for 10 women and one group (Cancer de Mama Clinic in Mexico) across Canada and the U.S.  These women don't have access to good prosthetics and they really need some help. We have the ability to fit prosthetics effectively at a distance, but not the financial capacity to do it. Our goal of $12,500 has to be met by June 15/15 or we can't make it happen. Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that is all or nothing. 

I would be very grateful if you would consider donating and also share my campaign with your network and encourage them to donate. We have enlisted the Crash Test Dummies rock band members to help, and quite a few people are supporting us, but we really need more donations. You can visit [my Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/166498973/building-a-better-breast-prosthesis?ref=discovery) and search for Building a Better Breast Prosthesis by Wendy Smith. Be sure and read all the updates to get the whole story. I would really like to show that there is support for this important initiative here in Winnipeg, especially when surgical reconstruction gets so much attention and financial support. I think it's only fair that women have a choice about which road of recovery they take. 

As of right now we've raised $3,013. We have a ways to go. Please spread the word.

bc,"My mom was diagnosed today...
I'm 28 and my mother was diagnosed today. I'm still really processing the news, but I imagine my thoughts and feelings pale in comparison to what she's going through...

It puts a lot on my mind though. She's always had illness issues and rheumatoid arthritis and a host of mental issues including severe depression, bipolar, and drug addiction.

Essentially we've never really gotten along due to a lot of factors but I've always loved her and tried and tried again to be a part of her life. I'm now 28 years old and recently, for the first time, was able to connect with her and start building a relationship.

Sadly, she and my boyfriend got into it one day and she handled it in the same way she does most things in my life: light it on fire and watch it burn. So we ended up moving a short distance away from my home town to get some distance and try again at a relationship without living right next to one another.

My mother is an addict... But she has a big heart. She is a hard working woman, a suffering woman. She has been sexually assaulted, homeless, near death the addiction she had was so bad, and even close to dying from the various illnesses that have plagued her most of my adult life.

I have loved her with all of my heart, and I have despised her with every fiber of my being at various times.

And after four weeks of distance from the emotions and anger that we all had in our recent interaction, I was at peace with knowing the road ahead was still possible to build that relationship one day at a time.

And then suddenly, this past week, my mom woke up and had a large inch and a half by two inch lump in her breast. It was painful she said. Then she noticed a hard lump on her neck that same day, behind her ear. Then a lump on her head.

At first, we thought this was probably an infection, or maybe a cyst situation gone astray. Troublesome indeed, but not earth shattering. She'd go to the doctor when she could find time off work, it was decided, and all would be well.

I had a feeling something just wasn't right. Sure, the lump moved a bit. Sure l, it was painful, which is not typical. And sure the lump was sudden and large. Not to mention other areas of the body showing the same rapidly appearing odd changes.

I told her I'd feel happier if she'd take time off work that day and go to urgent care for a quick check up. 

And so she did. The tests came back, the doctor called personally with the initial results. The lump does not contain fluid... It is most assuredly cancer, he said, and it was important a more thorough diagnostic was completed as soon as possibly could be scheduled. 

The other locations, the doctor informed us, were indicative that this was either a cancer that has spread to her breast, and other locations, or more likely is a stage iv breast cancer scenario that has been rapid in developing. My mom was religious about being aware of her body and checked herself for any breast changes every single day. 

Suddenly her body was different. Suddenly it wasn't the same one she had known for 49 years. And suddenly this complicated person in my life, who fills me with rage and love, disappointment and pride, pain and triumphant joy, this person who I admire and pity... This person who I regard as both the best person I have ever known and the worst person I've ever known. Suddenly this person has become the center of my universe... 

And I don't know how to deal...I lost my father 6 years ago to suicide... And now from the timelines discussed with my mother and I, it is likely I will lose my mom before I'm thirty. Her immune system isn't very strong due to ramicade infusions for her arthritis so the outlook is fairly grim regardless of cancer type. 

My little brother is seven. If anything happens to my mom... Suddenly Im not just big brother anymore. So I'm processing this idea, and it's emotionally suffocating on top of the existing layer. 

There's so much happening around me right now, and in no way am I the one suffering most. But at the end of the day, I am suffering. And the pain is tremendous, regardless of my mixed emotions about her. 

She may be the reason for some of my worst memories in life. But she is also the focus of many of the best.  And I always imagined her being around, at least until I reached middle age and my brother was graduated from a college with fancy degree from somewhere he could always be proud of. And she'd be there for him like she never was for me because she is devoted to her second chance as a mother. Her way of making up for the mistakes of her past with me was to do right by him and show me she learned about being a mother through confronting that pain she created. 

But that progress will be cut short. I will be there for this woman I never truly understood but who loved me in her own way, as best she could. But soon, she will no longer be there for me, or my family, or her friends. I'm just...

Emotional tonight. 

I wanted to say something somewhere safe so that I can get all that out. Thank you guys for listening. 

TL;DR: My mom and I have a very strained relationship and her new cancer diagnosis has made me confront a lot of emotions all at once."

I set up a gofundme me for her. www.gofundme.com/breastcancersucksa if anyone is interested in donating. Anything will help. Even just keeping her in your thoughts and prayers. Thanks everyone :)
bc,"My mom had IDC, had a single mastectomy, lymph nodes were clear. However, due to the type 3 (aggressive) and kind  of cancer (something about hormone receptors), her recurrence factor is 31 which suggests chemo is recommended. However, she's 63 and I'm worried that chemo will be very very hard on her and she may not have a recurrence anyway.

Obviously she's discussing this with her oncologist next week and my dad is supporting her in whatever she chooses. But personally, chemo would be a last resort if it was me - which it's not, I get that. She trusts doctors and I'm afraid she may be swayed into chemo without really needing it. But I don't want to sound unsupportive either. She thought with the lymph nodes being clear that she was out of the woods but now she's made up her mind she's going through with chemo. Advice on how to approach her? We're fairly close, I live next door and helped with her dressing changes etc.

Edit: Thanks for the comments and feedback. Of course I will support her in whatever treatment she chooses. It made me feel better to hear that the kinds of chemo available now are improved. She showed me some head scarves she wants to order, so I think I will help her purchase some of those and get her some other pampering gifts. Thanks again."

bc,"To the lonely at Christmas
I see you
and I know.
I know what it's like to get together for the first time
and have to set the table for one less
then you did the year before
because cancer came and
left you an empty chair

I know what it's like to feel the unraveling
of a happy family
torn apart
by grief and loss
and divorce and pain
wondering if things ""will ever be the same""

I see you
and I know.

I know that you're tired and you've had enough
of hospital rooms and bad news
and agonizing heartbreak
to last you a lifetime
I see you
trying so hard to make it a fun Christmas
and yet your tears won't dry up in time
to celebrate

Your pain is too great
for
all the white elephant parties
and gift exchanges with friends
and your night is too dark to be lit up by
mall lights
and twinkling Christmas trees

I see you
and I know.

I know what it's like to lay in bed for days
and pray for the grace
to get up
and to show up
one more day

When your soul and your body ache
from the never-ending struggle
to be seen
to be known
and yet there is no one
that sees

Your husband is too busy
and your kids don't come home
and you've lost everything
you've ever known
your health
your laughter
your freedom
your hope

I see you
and I know.

I know the depression that sets in
to your bones
this time of the year
when everyone's got someone
everybody's got places to go
and you're all alone
in a crowd of strangers
and you're supposed to be happy
but the tears won't dry up
the wound won't heal up
in time to make it
a Merry Christmas

So you stay in your frozen brick house
and watch the sun come up
and go down
every day
hoping that maybe someone
somewhere sees you this Christmas
and cares about the things you're going through

Well I do.
I see you
and I know

I know what it's like to be lonely at Christmas
to feel isolated
and unappreciated
and afraid
at the holidays

To be stuck in a place
a part of your past
you can't erase
a relationship
that no longer serves you
but still haunts and torments
you
every day

I know what it's like to live in a dream
so real and so bad that it wakes you up
each night
and crushes your chest
leaving you breathless
exhausted
and incapacitated
from the weight of its
reality

when the lights have gone out
and the people have vanished
and there is no more magic left
in your childhood stories
of Santa
or baby Jesus
or of the virgin Mary

It's all meaningless
and empty
like the bottle of pills
that lay on your dresser drawer
last night
and the unfinished plans
you had made with a friend
the day before

No matter where you are
no matter what or when or how
you come to the table
this Christmas,
I want you to know that you are seen and
loved and heard
and you are not alone.

I see you
and I know.

bc,"I noticed a fast growing lump in my breast last February and put off a doctors appointment until my employer offered me benefits and full time hours ending my 90 day probation period. That never happened because their workflow was too slow. I then applied for State of California medical plans and had missed all of the enrollment periods. I applied for special enrollment and got denied. I had to wait until November to enroll and it took until Dec. 27th before I got coverage and got to finally see a doctor. By this time I have a grapefruit size fungating tumor which indicates to me (not a doctor) very end stage cancer. The clinic doctors I saw freaked and ordered a STAT oncology referral and a STAT MRI. Medi-Cal denied both and told me I had to get a mammogram and an ultrasound first. That was scheduled for this morning. This morning they called and said they would not cover an ultrasound only a mammogram. When I got to my appointment the imaging center said they do not do mammograms without ultrasounds and cancelled my appointment. Also I don't have a boob left, just a huge open tumor which I cannot imagine squishing in a mammogram machine. 

So here are my questions (and thank you for reading this far.) 

1. Is it true in your experience that a mammogram is never done without an ultrasound?

2. Can you mammogram a straight tumor that has no flesh left on it? 

Sorry if that's gross but cancer isn't pretty."
bc,"Lymphedema in arm: operation or not?
Hi there,

It's been 10 years since I discovered I had breast cancer (right breast, not metastasized). Had a breast amputation, chemo, radiation and 2 y later a breast reconstruction with belly tissue and belly fat.
Since 7y ago I developed lymphedema in my right arm. I have physical therapy 2x/ week, wear an arm sleeve (but am not always consistent, not so easy always to endure it), and try to avoid strenuous exercise for the right arm or lifting too heavy stuff.
But I still have a difference in circumference of 9 cm between both arms. And it hurts bad some days, to the point I can't sleep or feel my fingers. 

I heard of an new kind of operation performed where I live (Belgium), where they connect the ""ducts"" (don't know the right word) that transfer the lymphe fluid to a blood vessel in your arm so that the fluid can evacuate from your arm. 
But I can't seem to find much people who already had this kind of surgery...
Maybe anybody here has had this operation or knows someone who has? I'd love to know how that went and if they had improvement?

Greetings from Belgium x"
bc,"My mom was just diagnosed with breast cancer. She has a tumor in both her breast and lymph node near her armpit (and will be getting a full body scan to see if it has spread elsewhere).

bc,"My mom has been through two lumpectomies and is starting radiation. She met with an oncologist she really liked but mid way through the oncologist (who is a man) said he'd be starting the exam now.
My mom asked if she should remove all her clothes (you know paper gown style) and he said no that just the top was fine, he then reached behind her to undo her bra. Is that weird? He works with a lot of elderly breast cancer patients so maybe he assumed she just wouldn't have the mobility or something.

bc,"Hello, I was really on the fence about posting here but at the same time feel it may offer or help me too. my wife (39f)had discovered a lump up near armpit last Sept 2016, we all know where this story is going. she was diagnosed stage 2B, until surgery determined the tumor was in her lymph nodes as well which put her at stage 3. Thankfully the body scans revealed no other hot spots through her body that concerned doctors. She's had a double mastectomy already, and went through the radiation process as well as 1 complete round of chemo. Currently her last session of chemo is halted due to her most recent heart scan (Muga scan?) that revealed her heart had deteriorated to 59% efficiency. She was scheduled for reconstruction in about 6-7 weeks but That's obviously on hold until her chemo regiment is completed. That's currently where we stand. 

So that's in a nutshell our story to now. I do as much as I can to help her remain happy, cheerful and feeling good about herself. I myself have never been a big 'wordy' compliment guy (things like you look beautiful, that ass is rocking.... [threw that one in for the smiles]) so if I try saying things out of character for me then she knows its only being said to boost her. she knows I feel it, but words from me aim to overdo it and come off forced. anyway this isn't about me and my issues...

now keeping her uplifted hasn't always been the easiest thing, she's carrying a lot of fear obviously but added in she's feeling a lot of guilt. guilty in part due to the financial strain this had brought us and how its affected our 4 children's lives. We had just moved to a new home in a great community for our 4 children. the wife finally had a decent - good paying job and we seemed to finally be getting ahead for once. As we know these type things cannot be planned, but we make the best of them. So added into the strain financially, this also offset vacation plans (a hopeful cruise for all 6 of us this upcoming summer before the 16ur old wants nothing to do with us anymore) we'd made and began saving for. Credit cards are now maxed and getting behind, just all around usual expected issues. We did receive some help from an organization so I'm not trying to make it all about that. We're managing the best we can, just plans are gonna be waiting longer.  

She's also upset that reconstruction won't come close to the size she was previously. she was a full DD (which being the dude in relationship I was all for), but after her 800cc limit she's looking at maybe a C cup which upsets her daily. radiation restrictions may not even let her get that much they're saying now too. she wanted to win that big lotto game this weekend to get her giant knockers overseas instead. Last area of guilt for her is that no camping trip or really anything took place for the kids this past summer. she just didn't have the strength and feels bad that we just couldn't do even that. 

anyway, as I said I was really unsure about posting here but I guess in a way i was looking for somewhere to talk to someone too. (we did run a mediocre 'gofundme' early on for financial reasons which helped a bit. just throwing that out there too avoid the question if someone asked).

So now that I've bored and spilled my issues out to you, I ask for anyone who's been through or currently fighting this awful disease... what're things you've done or are doing to keep things cheerful? while not being wordy, I also do not let her put herself down, I do always compliment or talk her outta that. I'm also trying to come up with some way to make some sort of vacation happen this year, thinking of gangbusters on eBay maybe.

Ok, I think I'm done talking to myself out loud as I cannot imagine anyone made it this far. if you did, thank you. I'd shake your hand or maybe pat you on the back for it, but just imagine I did. Again any words of advice, besides ""your an ass"" would be appreciated."

I discovered my PP visit was not covered because I don't have the ""medicaid"" version of my insurance, I have the ""marketplace"" version so I have no out of network benefits. My insurance instructed me to find a doctor in my network and to search ""specialists."" The issue I'm having is I don't know what ""specialist"" I should be looking for at this point. I'm finding a lot of OB/GYN specialists but I was under the impression that they do an exam and give the referral I already have, not that they actually do mammograms. Is an OB/GYN who I should see at this point? Thank you in advance."
bc,How old were you when diagnosed?
bc,"I’m 29 and had my annual yesterday. I went in expecting a relatively quick and straightforward appt that would lead to a refill of my birth control. During the breast exam portion, I noticed my doc spending more time palpating  than usual, and when she busted out a tape measure, I knew in my gut what she was going to say next. And I didn’t actually hear much of what she had to say. My reptilian brain took over.

Here’s the little that I know:
-It is roughly 4 cm on my left breast at ~10 o’clock 
-It’s slightly tender to the touch
-No skin dimpling, nipple discharge, discoloration, or other notable symptoms
-I am scheduled for an ultrasound and bilateral mammogram in 6 days

My doc told me to not lose any sleep over it. Ha! My mind and body totally did not heed that advice. I’m terrified and struggling with the uncertainty and the waiting. This may very well be a fibroadenoma, or it may not be. I just don’t know, and I hate that I don’t know.

Any suggestions on what I can do to cope over the next couple of weeks of diagnostic procedures? How have you dealt with the waiting?"
bc,"44yrs old, possible fibroadenoma
44 yrs old, I had a fibroadenoma in my right breast 3.5 yrs ago, and after a biopsy they recommended taking it out because of a small chance it could be a phyllodes tumor (dr was 90% sure it was a fibroadenoma which it was). Now I have another lump on my left breast, and due to moving and new insurance I saw a different doctor on Friday. After feeling it she said it definitely feels like a fibroadenoma, ordered an ultrasound and mammogram (I just had a routine mammo 5 months ago that was clear). She said they may want to do a biopsy depending on how the ultrasound comes out. My question is, given my age and the fact that this is my 2nd lump in 3 years, why wouldn’t they do a biopsy off the bat? A mammogram and ultrasound will just confirm that the mass is there, right? I feel the mammogram is unnecessary and just want to get it biopsied. This doctor was also a bit dismissive, and said “you don’t have to get a fibrodenoma removed.” I am leaning heavily towards just taking it out given my age. 

Family history: maternal grandmother had breast cancer in her late 40’s and had a mastectomy with no return of cancer (lived to be 96). Neither my mom nor my 3 aunts have had BC so I’m not considered super high risk but I do have dense breast tissue."
bc,"Background: I've spent the last nine months focusing on my helping my mother (56) after she was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer.  She wrapped up radiation and chemo after having a double mastectomy and her ovaries removed in late spring and is thankfully doing very well.  Now her doctors are turning their eyes on me and heavily recommending that I get tested because my mother tested positive for BRAC2.  Her sister, my aunt, was diagnosed with breast cancer at 27 and was dead by 33 (she tested positive for BRCA2 as well), and my maternal grandmother died in her early forties also from breast cancer (this was far before any type of genetic testing.)  There are also a ton of relatives with ovarian cancers, so there's no doubt that her family has BRCA 2 and that eventually I'm going to have to get tested.  

The dilemma: Should I get tested now?  I'm in my last semester of college, landed a dream job, am pretty much living the dream in a great apartment in a great city in the States.  Yet whenever I go to the Dr's office I'm constantly pushed to get tested for BRCA2, but no one can offer me any examples of preventative steps that could be taken if I tested positive other than invasive surgery (how the hell is a 22 year old supposed to take the news that they should have a preventative double mastectomy??) and starting mammograms very, very early.  I know that I never want children, so there's no need to worry about me passing on this thing, but I'm scared of not knowing and having something slip under the radar of my doctors.  

Has anyone here had any experience with getting tested at a really young age?  Obviously the ideal outcome is I test negative and get to have a normal life without waiting for a ticking time bomb to go off, but I know that's not the guaranteed outcome."

bc,Yesterday my mom got a follow up mamogram which revealed an oddly shaped lump in her left breast. She is getting a biopsy next week and then talking to a surgeon. I can't seem to find a straight answer but does breast cancer eventually kill you? If surgery and treatment is successful in killing the cancerous cells can she live a long life?  I can't stop thinking about losing her. I am only 16 and I want to spend as much time with her and I can't imagine her not being there when I am older.
bc,"Update on mom's diagnosis.
I'm sorry this is a very long story... I'm updating it as we go... I would really appreciate it even if you read only the last update and reply with any thoughts or suggestions. Thank you and God bless.

My mom (50) felt something under her armpit right breast. Went in for mammogram couple weeks later. Doctors saw a tumor approximately 1.4 cm they said. They ordered a biopsy right away. After a week doctor called my mother and broke the horrible news to her. The tumor is hormone positive (estrogen and progesterone positive). Also the lymph node was cancerous as well. Days later we met with the oncologist and she said that doctor told her at the time of the biopsy he felt tumor was bigger than 1.4 cm. It's more like 4-5 cm... They performed a CT scan and bone scan to check if it has spreaded anywhere else. My whole family and I are all in fear, although I'm trying to keep everyone positive and worry free but it's still pretty hard on us because it's first in family... We have a meeting with doctor and oncologist this week. I want to be prepared and ask the right questions such as treatments and questions about this cancer in general. Im willing to do anything to help out my mom. I started researching all kinds of different diets... (Alkaline, low asparagine diets...) She's not overweight or anything but like I said any help I can provide for her and help her beat this!! Please help me, help her!! 

Update: 02/25/18 // The oncologist called us and said that according to the CT scan, everything looks clear (Thank God) but the bone test showed one suspecious area (left iliac pelvis). Oncologist recommended MRI just to double check on that. She also hinted that the doctor would like to start with hormone pill therapy to shrink the tumor for about 3-6 months then surgery and remove it.

Update: 03/10/18 // My mom did another MRI for both breasts. Tumor showed to be bigger. (8 cm) also MRI on the pelvis. Still can't tell if it's cancer or not. Also bone test was done check on density of bones.

Update: 03/19/18 // Oncologist called again. She said after reviewing my moms case with different doctors at the meeting this time, it was suggested to do chemotherapy instead of the pills because they're not still sure if the left iliac pelvis is cancer or not... Three different tests and they still not sure... I told her that were looking for second opinion from different hospital and doctor... Idk what to do anymore.

Update: 03/21/18 // Had a meeting with the oncologist. She went over all the tests and scan results all over again. She said based on the latest MRI test of breasts and whole body. The tumor is 8cm and also shows 4 other lymph nodes cancer positive. Tumor is hormone positive. It has nothing to do with her2 positive or negative. Tumor is also a very low grade. (Grade 1.) Pelvis still is unknown if it's cancer or an age related fracture. Doing biopsy on it wouldn't be so easy because it is an very small area... So the whole plan changed based on the second hospital staff meeting. Now the recommendation is AC-T Chemotherapy FIRST. AC part will be standard 60ml given every 2 weeks x 4 cycles. T part would be once a week for 12 weeks. Then surgery and more likely mastectomy... Then arimidex pill therapy where it can go for 5-10 years... We're on our way for a different doctor and second opinion.

Update: 03/21/18 // Spoke with a different oncologist. This doctor is truly God sent! Right away he asked to get the all the medical records from all different hospitals and doctors... After looking at the most recent exams and tests he said he agrees nor disagrees with the previous oncologist; however, he called a very known radiologist to see if it's possible to do an biopsy on the pelvis bone. And the answer was yes. My mom is scheduled next week for the pelvis biopsy to see if it's cancer or not. Also doctor said to stop with the Anastrozole pills so biopsy results are more accurate. He also ordered an BRCA test. First day my mom didn't take the pill after 2 weeks now...The tumor is 8cm big already. It couldve been growing for a very long time and my mom still physically healthy and young so it wouldn't hurt to put a stop to the pill for little bit to get more accurate results. As of right now my mom is kind of against chemo. I did research as much as I can on what could be done instead of chemo... 

Update: 04/16/18// Spoke with the oncologist again. BRCA test came back negative so that means my mom is not carrying a gene and wasn't passed to her from previous family. Doctor said since my mom is young and in an healthy shape, do the full ACT chemotherapy regimen. That's to shrink down the tumor from 8cm to a reasonable size so with surgery they're able to remove it or possibly a mastectomy since it's big. Now, the tumor is grade 1, has not spreaded anywhere else and it is Estrogen and Progesterone positive. Doctor said since it's not anywhere else in the body, this is the best option and it is curable! My mom is afraid of chemo but now it's two doctors that have recommended the same thing. She's willing to do it but any other thoughts and questions I can ask the doctor for the treatment? 

Update: 04/23/18// Last update before chemo. Went in today for the port placement. It took about 1-2  hours total... Everything went well. Port was positive placed a the opposite side (left) of tumor. Approximately 7 days, she will start the chemo. She's still not happy about chemotherapy but knows that it will help her instead of hurtting her. God willing everything will go smoothly."
bc,"I will be 41 this month, and I was diagnosed with stage 1 grade 3 in July. Went through double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction (no radiation required, lymph nodes negative). With onco score of 22, the recurrence rate will go down from 11% (with Tamoxifen) to 7% (Tamoxifen and chemo). I’ve been going back and forth and can’t decide to do chemo or not. If chemo, it will be four rounds of Cytoxan and Taxotere every three weeks. Oncologist couldn’t recommend because I’m in the “grey” onco range where chemo benefit is unclear. What would you do?"

bc,"Hi,  

I am BRCA+ and my husband and I are starting to talk about having kids. We do not have any infertility problems (that we know about) but have met with an IVF doctor to discuss PGD (pre-implementation genetic diagnosis, where if you do IVF they can look at the embryos and pick ones that don't have the mutation). We are trying to decide whether to move forward with it and I'm wondering if anyone else has gone through this decision, and what factors you considered.

bc,"My best friend (male) is 19 years old and breast cancer runs in his family. He recently found a lump under his left nipple during an exam. The doctor told him not to necessarily worry about anything just yet, as it could be ""nothing""-- but he's getting a mammogram on Monday. 

I don't know if it's breast cancer, but if it is, is there any way to know what stage is might be at before the mammogram? I'm sorry if this seems irrational or an overreaction, but he's my best friend and has been since we were four. There's no way in hell I'd ever be prepared to lose him early.

If anyone can be honest with me, it would be greatly appreciated. And for everyone on here struggling with breast cancer, keep fighting, and the best of luck.

As of Christmas morning, I noticed that an area between my breast and my armpit was swollen. I hadn't noticed it before that morning and it's been there since and while it hasn't grown and I haven't noticed anything else strange, I'm still frightened. 

I read online that it could be my lymph nodes that are swollen and that lymph nodes can swell in response to an injury on the arm or hand. Strangely enough, I burned my hand on that same side the night before I found the swelling.

The swollen area isn't hard, red, or painful, and it isn't like a small lump, either.. It feels like when you have a flu or infection and your neck swells up (kinda like ""generalized swelling""? I can't think of a better term for it).

I guess I just needed some reassurance and some advice. My father was recently diagnosed with cancer and it's got me pretty spooked.

Again, I apologize for asking such a question here and I hope that all of you find peace and success in your journeys. Bless you all."
bc,"Hello. About a two weeks ago I started feeling a full pain in my spine, shoulder and running down my arm. It would stay all day some days then come and go. I noticed a bit of clear discharge and a small 1-2 cm lump on the top of my nipple. I get sudden jolt of pain that go straight there as well. My doctor wants me to have a mammogram but, the office I'd go to refuses to do it due to being 27. I've been pushed back to an ultrasound until the end of the month. I'm scared because they pulled a precancerous colon from me a few months back. I feel like I'm being treated differently because of my insurance as well. Unsure what to do but trying to distract. I've got two little ones who need me here. Anyone have a similar story?"
bc,"My mom was just diagnosed with IDC and it feels like I'm having a harder time with it than her I swear. I'm 19 and she's 45 and she is my best friend and has been my whole life. It's always been us against the world and now I feel helpless. My question to all of you is, besides holding it together and being strong, what can I do for her? How did you feel? Can I get her anything, care packages, food, is there anything you wished you'd had? I want to help anyway I can. Thanks in advance for any replies :)"
bc,"OK so my grandma likely has breast cancer.  They found microcalcifications (I think she said that she saw 7 dots on her mammogram).  She's going for her biopsy.

The issue right now is that she's been on HRT for over 20 years.  I'm not sure which one...I could ask.  She's tried to go off a few times during those 20 years but she gets hot flashes, sweats, tingly feelings all over....It makes her life hell.  She wants an alternative or a way to help her relieve those symptoms or a way to wean herself...

Do any of you have suggestions?  Her doctor isn't the best btw.  She prescribed her clonazepam...My grandma found out what it was and refuses to take it.  She's not anxious, she just doesn't want hot flashes that never end...

Thank you"
bc,The oncologist says that the cancerous cell on the livery and bones are breastcancer cell too. Don't they originate from the main tumor??
bc,"I'm a 22-year-old guy who just found out his mom has breast cancer.

She doesn't know it yet. She just knows it's ""not so good"" but doesn't really know that it's a cancer. My sister will reveal it to her tomorrow. In the meantime, I'm really worried about her health! I'm so sad right now! Why her? Grrr.

She's not in the initial stage so I don't know what her chances really are. Tonight, when she came back home with my dad, I noticed everyone was sad but I didn't say anything. They don't know I know it all. Just waiting for tomorrow, as said, when I will have more technical informations.

It's more like a vent. I will delete it if it violates the subreddit guidelines.

*hugs to all*"

bc,"Hi ladies, 

I've been a lurker, it's hard to revisit this entire period of my life, and I thought it was nearly over. I had DCIS in 2008 (age 32/33) and a left mastectomy. I didn't know that a double was possible... So, six years later,  I have just run the gamut of a prophylactic mastectomy of the right side.  I put it off for 6 years because there were complications last time - tissue breakdown, the onset of depression that won't go away and the scarring was/is awful, never mind the massive weight gain (literally went from 75 kgs to 105 kgs). A return to tertiary studies has helped with passing the time but not really enough to get over it all. 

It's been virtually impossible to move beyond it all, and since this prophylactic surgery, I have had 3 infections, tissue breakdown and struggled with pain control and my husband (still) having to work away. 

Anyway, July 2014 I had the surgery and we booked in the implant exchange back in September, it was meant to be tomorrow at 1330. Two hours ago the surgeon's office called, there is no implant available. I don't understand how it can be such an eleventh hour problem, especially since it was booked four months ago. I'm so disappointed, I was so looking forward for it all being over, I just want to cry like a big ol' baby.

Rationally I know that things could be worse, and that a couple of days extra waiting time is not a big deal compared to the 7 years since dx, but I'm just so sad. 

Sorry for being a complainer, I just haven't got anyone else who might understand."

bc,"My mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer, and we just received the news that she will have to undergo a double mastectomy. We are thrilled that the cancer can be removed, but even with reconstructive surgery, she is already heart broken at the thought her womanhood taken from her, especially from scaring and nipple removal. 

I am so thankful that my mom will be okay, but it's hard for me to understand the pain she is going through knowing that her breasts won't be the same again. Does anyone have advice on how I can make my beautiful mom feel great about her body post surgery? Did anyone do things for you after surgery that lifted your spirits? Or any advice at all on how I can be there for my mom throughout this journey."
bc,"I don't know where else to ask this.  I'm hoping someone else has experienced this.

I went in for a routine mammogram and within five days had a needle biopsy and was scheduled for surgery.  Turns out, I have ADH and the tumor was benign.  Next time I met with the doctor, she told me I had to stop taking the pill (which I was taking to regulate my hormones which were literally keeping me from work a couple days EACH AND EVERY MONTH which is why I have no respect for companies that won't cover birth control *finally breathes*). Within days of going off, I started having hot flashes. I'm waking up 5-8 times a night feeling like I'm covered in hot coals. One sip of wine and I'm stripping off my clothes (instead of the normal bottle that it usually takes). I'm spraying my side of the bed with Febreeze because it smells like the bottom of a gym bag every morning.

I called my OB/GYN about it and she said she didn't *know* if it was the birth control and didn't *think* it would be the cause, but make an appointment and we'll talk about it while I charge you $200 to give you the same answer. (ok, I may have made up that last part) Has anyone ever had this experience? I mean, it seems to me that going off a hormone stabilizer would very easily kick me into menopause. But it also seems to me that my doctor should know this.  Has anyone experienced this?  Is there anything I can do?  I haven't slept in a couple of months and am going crazy."
bc,"I came to this subreddit to look for similar experiences, but even though I didn't necessarily find what I was looking for, I ended up subscribing because everyone seems so genuine and supportive. Around 2 weeks ago I noticed a really nasty bruise right under my areola. It wasn't there one day, then within 2 days it was. It is really dark with even darker spots inside, then some green and yellow areas. Honestly, it's the worst bruise that I have ever had. There was a small lump that has gotten bigger as time goes on. I went to my family doctor's nurse practitioner after the first week. She said that she wasn't overly concerned, but sent me for a mammogram and an ultrasound. I was hoping that it was just a cyst of some sort, but it is solid. I am having a biopsy on Monday and am just really anxious. I read about fatty necrosis, but haven't had an injury. Has anyone else had a similar experience or does anyone know of anything similar? Thank you so much for any input."
bc,"I have been following this subreddit for a few weeks and found much comfort here, so I thought I'd share my mom's story.

My mom recently had a burning sensation in one of her breasts and immediately setup an appointment.  She has been getting her scans yearly, but sure enough, it turned out to be DCIS as well as Invasive Ductal Carcinoma.  

Since her diagnosis, she had a biopsy on her lymph nodes and sadly, they found cancer there as well.  This was a huge fear and she had a full body MRI and bone scan 2 days later.  Thankfully, the cancer has not spread anywhere else.  The tumor on her breast is really large however (over 8cm) and that is why it is staged at 3 and also due to the fact that it is in the lymph nodes.

We met her surgeon yesterday and her oncologist today.  She will be going through about 5 months of chemo, then a month of recovery, then a mastectomy (possible double).  After that, she will be on radiation.  

The first 4 rounds of chemo will be the worst and she said that will last 2 months.  I don't have the names of the chemo she will take on hand (I wrote it all down), but I know ultimately she will be on Herceptin since she is HER2+.

I am afraid for her, the pain and suffering she will go through, but I am also hopeful she will beat this as are the doctors.  She has 5 grandkids who adore her as well as a husband and my sister and me.  To say our world has been rocked has been an understatement.

Thanks for everyone who has shared their stories here in the past and I wanted to share ours as well."
bc,"My mom found out she had stage 2 breast cancer right before Thanksgiving. It was absolute hell for me personally because she told me the news as soon as I got home for break - I’m in college, so when I went back that’s all I could think of. There is no history of breast cancer in my family other than my great great aunt. The only reason she got a mammogram when she did was because her job requires a physical. Fast forward almost 5 months later, she had the lumpectomy, she got to skip chemo and she’s had 7 rounds (out of 20) of radiation. She has to continue radiation regardless, but tomorrow she’ll find out if it’s gone. Her journey was very short and quick, and for that I’m incredibly thankful. I want to send out my best wishes to everyone on here because it’s not easy. If anyone has any concerns or questions about the lumpectomy or radiation let me know and I’d be happy to try and help. Stay strong, everyone. ❤️ 

EDIT: She’s cancer free!!"
bc,"My cousin has been undergoing treatment for breast cancer the past six months. She is a retired teacher and her pension is rather small. Prior to her treatment, she was a nanny to a family and supplemented her income that way. Now, she has had to drop that work because of her fatigue level. I am helping as much as I can, but I wanted to see if there are any charities out there which may render her any aid. She has good insurance, but the bills are piling up, and she has made some poor financial decisions (high interest loans, etc). If anyone could point us in the right direction, it would be most appreciated. Thank you."
bc,"On December 8th, 2017, I was diagnosed with estrogen-receptive invasive lobular carcinoma. I've been told by so many people that I'm too young. I'm never sure how to respond.

I'm newly 30. My hair is cut short and will be gone in a month or so. I lose my right breast on Monday morning. 

I was about to start having kids and now i'm told that may never happen now. I waited too long for every good reason there was. Not financially stable, no insurance, where we lived wasn't the right place yet. Finally we are ready and I am diagnosed.

That's the hardest part. I'll lose my hair and grow it back. I'll lose my boobs and get new ones. It will be a really crappy year but I can look beyond it... to no children. I'm contemplating egg harvesting but even then, I can't implant them for at least 10 years due to the hormone therapy they said I need to do. 40 years old and having my first child? Even if I can afford it? Even if it sticks...

I'm not really okay with that and I don't yet know how to be.

Pairing that with my nerves about my surgery in a couple days, I had to finally post something after peeking around on here for the last month.

I have plenty of support in my life, but they don't know what it actually feels like. Thank you for being here."
bc,She had a lump confirmed as malignant last week and is starting chemo next week. She has 2 babies under 2yrs old. I want to be there to help how can I be useful without getting in the way?!
bc,I just turned 40 and had my very first mammogram. I got a call this morning that they need me to come in for additional images in my right breast because there was some asymmetry. How common is that? What does that mean?
bc,"Been to the Dr. several times but not feeling satisfied with the results. Not sure where else to turn.
I'm not sure if this is allowed but I'm not sure where else to post. I didn't see any community rules? 

To start, I'm a 23/F with a history of cancer in my family. My great aunt had breast and my grandma had ovarian, my uncle had pancreatic and my sister had skin cancer. My uncle had lung cancer but he was also a smoker. I do have an appointment with my GYN on the 2nd of August and an appointment with a breast surgeon on the 8th of August. I'm concerned because I've seen both of these people before and have been given no answers other than ""typical, dense, lumpy breast tissue.""

About a year ago, I noticed a lump in my right breast slightly above the nipple.  I went to my GYN and had her look at it and she scheduled an ultrasound.  The ultrasound came up with nothing?  They didn't even see any sort of mass however it is very palpable.  I feel it most when I'm sitting up and it's the size of about a marble.  

A few months later, I felt like it had gotten a bit bigger and so I went back to my GYN and she agreed that it was more palpable than last time. So she referred me to a breast specialist. The breast specialist reassured me at the time that if the lump had been there for a year and remained relatively unchanged, it most likely wasn't cancerous. He did another ultrasound and again, came up with nothing.  He, however, wasn't able to feel what I am feeling?  He said that the fact that I could feel the lump when sitting up and not when laying down is a good sign because it is most likely just clumped up breast tissue.

Well a few weeks ago I noticed the lump was more pronounced than it had been before (to cope with my constant anxiety about this I pretty much tried to avoid looking/touching my breasts at all for a few weeks).  I laid down and felt where the lump is and now I can *definitely* feel it lying down where as I wasn't able to before.

And *now* I am feeling a weird spot on the other side of my nipple.  It's quite large so I'm inclined to think it could be due to caffiene consumption or something harmless.  However, for the last few weeks, my right nipple has been really sensitive.  It's uncomfortable to wear a bra, it's uncomfortable to not wear one, and touching it is just extremely strange feeling.  It's like there's a tender spot directly behind my nipple.  When I press down, it kind of zings all the way into my back and aches all over my right breast.  I also keep finding these little scratches on my breast which seem to show up out of nowhere.  They aren't really anywhere where the wire of my bra could be poking me or anything?  That may or may not be related but that's also been happening.  The skin of my areola is kind of itchy and getting a little scaly looking which is also a new development.

My left breast feels totally normal.  No lumps and bumps, no tenderness.  My right breast is noticeably larger than the left but I can't say with confidence that it hasn't always been that way.  I don't remember noticing it before last year but I also never paid much attention to my breasts until I noticed something abnormal. 

Anyway, I don't know what I'm looking for exactly I'm just kind of freaking out.  I feel like something is going on and I've had at least four ultrasounds in the last year and they've all come back blank.  The breast surgeon doesn't even seem to feel anything unusual even though I very clearly do.  This tenderness isn't normal and these lumps have absolutely not always been there.

EDIT: I meant to mention that last year I did quit consuming caffeine completely for about 6 months to see if it changed the size of the lump and it did not."
bc,"A few months ago I had a routine mammogram, I was later contacted by letter and asked to come in for a second one (six weeks later).  The appointment is next week.  Two days ago I think I found a lump in my right breast; I could just be paranoid.  There's six days between now and my exam - should I have it done sooner somehow?  My local ER doesn't have the capability."
bc,"I have two aunts, both had breast cancer.

My sister then told me mom to remove both breasts as prevention, and my mom is freaking out.

I wanted to know if it makes sense or not... although on a first look, the fact that all (two) of my mom sisters had breast cancer, it would make look like she having breast cancer is inevitable, there is also the fact that my mother's health is much better.

1. My mom exercises, both aunts don't. (either before, or after the cancer)

2. My mom eats correctly, aunts, don't. (one hates cooking, and just eat random crap, the other one love cooking, but only pastry, and makes and eats loads of tasty pastries).

3. My mom is not depressed, both aunts were before they had cancer.

4. My mom have a thyroid issue, but controlled, the aunts had other issues beside this (one had thyroid cancer, diabetes, and morbid obesity, the other one had the same thyroid issue as my mom, but due to her crappy diet also had anemia, ulcers, and other diet-related problems).


But I don't know anything about cancer, and my sister is a biologist, so I need some factual scientific information about this, if I don't say anything, my mom will just freak out.

That said, maybe my sister idea was more political than based on science (my sister is a fan of Angelina Jolie politics)."
bc,"Hello,

My mom was diagnosed with stage 2 grade 3 breast cancer in the fall. She had surgery in November to remove the tumour and some lymph nodes. 

She is now starting 16 weeks of chemo before doing 10 radiation treatments. 

I want to be as supportive as I can to her. I’ve asked her how I can be most supportive and she’s said just being there and talking with her - I’d like to do more if possible. 

I call regularly and visit every few weeks (she’s about two hours away). 

I’m thinking about ordering her a meal delivery service (https://www.chefsplate.com) for a few dinners a week. 

Any other tips/ideas/suggestions for how I can be supportive?

Thanks!"
bc,"Hello /r/breastcancer. I have searched a bit on this sub and I am sure this must be a common question so I apologize if I am being repetitive!

A couple of weeks ago I found a lump in my breast doing a self-exam. It's about the size of a ping pong ball, round, moveable, and painless. I went to my gyno who assured me that she is fairly positive it is completely benign. I am having an ultrasound and mammogram this week just in case though.

I have never had a mammogram before and I have been avoiding Google a bit because of all of the horror stories I've found and I don't want to freak myself out too much unless I have to. I was hoping some of you lovely ladies might want to share your experiences? Is a mammogram painful? I have fairly large breasts, does that make a difference? Will the radiologist tell me that day what they think? 

If they find something they believe to be benign would it just stay there forever or is it best to have it removed anyway? Could it possibly go away or become malignant at some point? 

Mostly I'm nervous about the appointment itself and trying not to worry myself too much. I appreciate any experiences you'd like to share!"
bc,"I'm a 26 year old female with no family history of breast cancer and have noticed a firm, non tender, moveable marble sized lump for the past month. I feel ridiculous making an appointment because the two people I've told reassure me that I'm too young for anything serious and that its just a cyst. Still, I have an appointment for next week and I just wondered if anyone knew what to expect or words of advice. I'm really really nervous and feel equally ridiculous for being nervous."
bc,Not a question for myself but for my aunt currently undergoing chemo. Does it matter if her chicken is organic or nonorganic?
bc,"Hey all,

So my wife goes in for a biopsy tomorrow, and I'm terrified about the results. I feel like I'm in a situation where I know too much to be good for myself. I used to work in a breast cancer research lab. I keep reading things on health websites about her symptoms, and even though she's young, and the statistics say as do the doctors that she most likely has a fibroadenomas, I can't help but match her symptoms up with far more serious conditions. Can you all offer any advice? Could I tell you the symptoms? Should I even be looking here for this kind of thing. What kind of support networks can I find for te significant others of people going trough cancer?"
bc,"Recently being diagnosed with breast cancer
Although, it is stage 1 and doctors are saying it can be treated. I don't know how to react. My family is saying it can be cured but what if it doesn't - what the tumor spreads to other parts of the body. Don't know how to react or keep my calm... it is like my life is changed... fuckkk cancerr"
bc,"I hope that science finds a cure for cancer...for all of them.  I know of cancer of course.  Who doesn't.  I'm sick myself (not breast cancer) but I recently made a post about my grandma who was diagnosed with breast cancer.  We were in the early stage and things are moving pretty fast.  I was destroyed by the news because she's like my mother.  She raised me for the first few years of my life until my mom took me back to give us a sucky life.

Well she met with the surgeon today.  She has microcalcifications and they will go in with some kind of harpoon soon but they were pretty sure that they will just be able to remove the masses as they are all in the same spot.  Then she will have one month of radiation.  She's got a 100% survival and recovery chance if she does this.  I know it's not fair to those who don't get that good news.  I'm a man.  I'm disabled but you now have me fighting for the cause.  The idea of losing someone I love so much was killing me.  It's not fair that some of you will or that some of you are going through hell battling for your life.  I'm so sory.  So so sorry.

I will help my grandma through this but afterwards, is there anything that I can do?  I've already ordered pink ribbons for the entire family.  I'm disabled so I don't make much money but I will be donating as much as I can to the Canadian Breast Cancer Association.  To those of you fighting, you are a warrior.  You're the definition of brave.  I'm sorry if I didn't think about breast cancer much before.  I'm so sorry.  I am so happy for my grandma and for myself because I'm selfish and I love her and I don't want her to suffer and to leave me.  I hope you don't hate me for that.  I wish all of you strength.  I wish all of you more time with your loved ones.  For those of us who do not have life threatening conditions, remember to tell those that you love that you do love them.  Show it to them too.  Don't get to a point where you regret not having done...  You want to be to a point where you're happy that you said or did...  Lastly, thank you to all the women who have fought for awareness, for advancement, for mandatory mammo's....My grandma is going to live because of your commitment.  I owe you my grandma's life.  I can NEVER repay you.  I will do my part to spread awareness.

Much love to everyone."

bc,"I'm new to this community and looking for people who have been through something similar and can speak to the experience. 

I have been getting bilateral sonograms every 6 months since I was 16 years old. I was tested for BRCA 1 and 2 at that age and it was negative, as it has been for all women on my maternal side. Yet, on my maternal side, my mother (47), grandmother (55), aunt (45, 50 double mastectomy), mother's cousin (50) and great-grandmother (55) have all been diagnosed though they didn't have the gene. I had my first biopsy 6 months ago, which was benign, but the lump has grown and I feel more forming, as I always have. 

As I'm getting older, I'm realising how scary this is becoming and reading stories about women who are diagnosed early and then can't have children is freaking me out. I guess I'm looking to hear from women who have been through this from a young age and what those stories are. Any insight would be great as I'm not especially close with any of the women in my family and have yet to find an outlet where I can discuss this. Thanks!"
bc,"Hi, I've posted a few times here and this community has been really supportive - thanks for all of the good advice and positive vibes.

My mother-in-law was told yesterday that she's essentially under ""palliative care"" at this point. She just started radiation (Monday of last week), as well as regularly taking Xeloda (started yesterday). On Monday they informed her that the cancer did spread to her bones, which is why she's been having aches. 

My wife is taking this all pretty hard, understandably, and is pretty much going through grieving now (although for the time being her mother is fairly healthy and capable, only she gets tired pretty quickly). Is there any advice for what I can do to help her cope, or what she can do herself?"
bc,Hello. I am looking for a good prosthetic for my sister who underwent masectomy today. I am looking everywhere but theres so much its a bit overwhelming. Can anyone help me to find the best one. Thank you.
bc,"I've had fibrocystic breast disease since I was about 15, and am 20 now. They're always heavy, sore and just feel disgusting. Cancer also happens to run in my family. Both my grandma and my great grandma died from cancer, so I feel like I need to be prepared and notice the signs ahead of time.

But how would I be able to notice breast cancer before it's too late? My breasts are very dense and filled with lumps that if believe it'd be too hard to notice a cancerous lump. How could a doctor even notice one?"
bc,"Today my wife and her friend made a plaster cast for their mutual friend who has breast cancer. She wanted to get a casting of her breasts before surgery, and she wanted me to document the process on camera. It was such a positive and heart-warming experience, and I was honored to have participated. I just wanted to share. My thoughts and prayers are with every one of you who is fighting the good fight."
bc,"Hi guys, so I found a lump about a month ago and I saw my doctor then and she told me to stop drinking caffine and see if that helped and it didn't and now my doctor has reffered me to get a breast ultrasound and she thinks I will most likely have to get a needle biosopy afterwards. I am really worried about this have broke down crying because I am just scared. Is this process normal? Any words of advice?

Edit: Appointment is scheduled for this Thursday, hoping everything goes well. My mom is going to come along with me. Super nervous...

Update: Everything showed up clear! We think it was a cyst orginally that burst or something and there was risidual from this. Thank you for all of your support and help with this."
bc,"Idk if this is the right place to post this but Idk who else to ask or where else to post this. I am post mastectomy with expanders in. I’m having a problem with my nipples &amp; idk if it’s normal or if there is something I’m supposed to be doing or that I’m doing wrong. Since the mastectomy my nipples are constantly hard &amp; never soften up and they are visible in every shirt I wear. It hurts to wear a bra with the expanders in so I bough nipple pasties just so I can wear shirts, but is this normal or do I need to look into it"
bc,"My mother has just had a lumpectomy and has been offered to be in a study that forgoes radiation therapy. She is in a very low risk group for recurrence so the idea is that radiation therapy doesn't make a very big difference in people like her.

bc,"Hello,

The other day I discovered a mysterious blue/pink mark (or bruise?) the size of a pencil eraser. After reading about IBC, I am extremely concerned and it has been on my mind for days. I made an appointment, and after speaking to a nurse she said she has never heard of anything like that leading to cancer.
What could it be though? I do not recall getting injured there, my bra is not uncomfortable, etc.

Has this ever happened to you?

Thanks for reading."
bc,"My Mom was just diagnosed
I don't really know where else to go with this. 
My mom finally went to the doctor after experiencing fatigue, chest pain, and bronchitis that just wouldn't go away.
Initially, the doc found a small cancerous tumor in her breast and the lymph node near her armpit. She walked out with a Stage 2b diagnosis. She mentioned the chest pain, so they ordered a pet scan and found a small tumor just near her breast bone.
 She didn't tell me if it was in her bone or lymph node. It's hard to get her to be honest about what the doctors are saying. She's trying to protect me and my sister.
 My Dad has been obsessively Googling cancer lifespans and assumes its spread to her bone and that she has Stage 4. He says she has years, not decades. He isn't sleeping, and his behavior worries me more than my Mom's.
My real questions are: is it possible that the pet scan could have just found the other tumor in her chest was  in her lymph node, not her bone?
Will stage 4 really give me less than five years with my mom?
She's my person and the idea of not having her hurts too much.
How can I support my family without making them feel insulted or weak?
Sorry for the rambling. I have no idea how to talk about this with friends and needed to spill it somewhere."
bc,Hi everyone. My mother finished chemo at the end of June and is still experiencing thrush and her nails on her hands a feet are still dieing. I know the symptoms from chemo can last for months after the treatment is over but I am wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to make these two symptoms easier to deal with. Thank you!
bc,"Hello, 

About 2 months ago my wife found a small lump (about the size of a pimple she says) in her breast tissue. My wife despises going to the doctor, and has been putting off any sort of treatment. 

She told me a couple days ago, knowing that my worry-wort self would insist on a doctor visit. 

My question is this: For the initial examination of the bump/lump does one go to a primary care physician, or does one go to some sort of specialist? 

Thank you for any input on the question or advice in general."

I'd like to find women in a similar situation:  I had a single mastectomy last week.  There was a small 1.5 cm, phase 1, invasive tumor discovered in the removed breast tissue. I had a very large area 10x6x3cm of DCIS, non-invasive, stage 0 tissue.

bc,"My mom is having surgery next week to get a lump(which is cancerous) and lymph nodes removed on her left breast. After the surgery, she will have to have a few rounds of radiation to make sure all of the cancer is gone as well. I want to help her be as comfortable as possible once she gets home from the hospital, so I'm gathering a few things to get her.  I was thinking a fluffy pillow, some soft pajamas to lounge in, I'm not sure what else to get her. Any ideas?"
bc,"Hi guys,

My 59 year old mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was caught relatively early and removed via lumpectomy. She's about 8 weeks from that and is struggling to decide if she wants to do chemo, as one of her nodes showed micromets of 2.0mm.

Oncotype DX score of 22 with a 16% recurrence rate with just localized radiation and 12% recurrence rate chemo + radiation.

She's afriad of the long-term side effects of chemo. Specifically the neurological and chemobrain stuff.

Any advice. Is it worth the 4% to get it all out of the system?"
bc,"My OBGYN found 4 cm lump during exam...I’m terrified.
I’m 29 and had my annual yesterday. I went in expecting a relatively quick and straightforward appt that would lead to a refill of my birth control. During the breast exam portion, I noticed my doc spending more time palpating  than usual, and when she busted out a tape measure, I knew in my gut what she was going to say next. And I didn’t actually hear much of what she had to say. My reptilian brain took over.

Here’s the little that I know:
-It is roughly 4 cm on my left breast at ~10 o’clock 
-It’s slightly tender to the touch
-No skin dimpling, nipple discharge, discoloration, or other notable symptoms
-I am scheduled for an ultrasound and bilateral mammogram in 6 days

My doc told me to not lose any sleep over it. Ha! My mind and body totally did not heed that advice. I’m terrified and struggling with the uncertainty and the waiting. This may very well be a fibroadenoma, or it may not be. I just don’t know, and I hate that I don’t know.

Any suggestions on what I can do to cope over the next couple of weeks of diagnostic procedures? How have you dealt with the waiting?"
bc,"To my breasts (cue that Greenday song they always play for retrospectives on TV)
Dear Boobs,
We’ve been through a lot. Remember when we went shopping for our first bra? Good times. During my teen years, with my personality and your good looks, we worked together to attract some top notch honeys. We bagged some real winners, like Brent, Jack, Squid, and ultimately we got our hooks into the best guy ever so we married him. Sometimes I think he likes you more than I do. But your time to shine was really when I had my babies. What’s this, you are going to provide us with free baby food for as long as we need it? All the while causing belly flattening contractions to my abdominal muscles… You really killed it in the postpartum era. Thank you for that. But then in my forties you tried to kill me. What the fuck, tits? I appreciate all you have done for me over the years but it’s time to say goodbye. Thanks for the mammories."
bc,"Okay so I'm probably over thinking this but I'm scared. I have a sort of rash on my breast. It's not even a rash, it's just that the top of my breast down to my nipple has been pinkish ( almost like a sunburn but kind of veiny looking) for 2.5 weeks and tonight it seems to have changed to almost like a purple colour. I've have some pain in that breast too for the last few months which I ignored as it was very mild but now I'm wondering if they're related.I have an appointment to have it looked at on Thursday but I just read that it can be a symptom of inflammatory breast cancer which is a very rapid form of cancer so I'm wondering if it's safe to wait that much longer"
bc,"Hi everyone!

I started a new sub for cancer survivors and their loved ones. The definition of cancer survivor for the sub is just someone who has been diagnosed with cancer at some point - so both people who are in-treatment and post-treatment are welcome. Also if you're a friend or family member of a cancer survivor, you're also welcome! Cancer affects more than just the person who was diagnosed, and we want to support you too. 

There is also a section stickied to the top for terminal cancer. I know that there isn't a sub for terminal cancer at the moment, but I wanted there to be a place on reddit for people with terminal cancer to feel free to discuss how they were feeling as well. They are also cancer survivors, they have been through a lot, and they are also an important part of our community. 

We're small at the moment, but I'm really hopeful that the r/ISurvivedCancer will continue to grow and be a place of support for cancer survivors and their loved ones. Please feel free to stop by, even if it's just to read the discussion. I know that when I finished treatment I didn't know what my life would be like, and I didn't have anyone to talk to who had gone through this before. I really want this sub to be a place that helps other people to not feel so alone in all of this. Hopefully we can all help each other along on the journey through, and post treatment.

I found a lump in my breast about the size of a large almond amd have had sharp pain from behind my breast when I touch the lump it is painful and I am really worried about what comes next. I am going to call my local womencare center first thing monday morning but should I be worried or am I just overthinking all of this."
bc,"Hello all, before I write anything else, I’m definitely labeling myself as a hypochondriac. Any time I experience any symptom, I google and worry for days and I know Reddit cannot diagnose me. But i am confused for what I should do next. Lately, I’ve been noticing pain when pressured down on my right side of my breast, mostly near my actual side where my bra wire sits. There is slight pain on the left side of my breast as well but not as bad as my right side. I have also been seeing when I wake up that I’ve been scratching my breasts overnight with marks all over them/dry skin surrounding my nipple. It also feels somewhat hard/lumpy where that pressure is on my breast. 

Anyways, I do not have any type of health insurance and my income is fairly low. So I don’t know what I should do from here or if I’m freaking out over something not as serious. I’m only concerned since breast cancer runs in my family."
bc,"Hi, 

my wife was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in december 2016 (she was 33 this time last year.) She has gone through all the treatments, like: chemo, herceptin because she's Her2 positive (I think is why she is on it?) and perjeta while she was doing chemo. She had a double mastectomy done on June 8th and had a decent recovery.

In early October (2017), her right side pelvis bone area really started hurting. She describes it as if it's a bruise, and when she moves in certain twists/turns, that it feels like someone is kicking her on the bruise. When this started happening is when she was working outside a lot, but she stopped for a few days which made the pain lessen, but never really went away per her description,

There are days where it's fine, days where it's not fine. More often than not, she mentions it bothering her (she's a pretty strong fighter, so it takes a good amount of pain for her to say something like that.)

The thought in both of our minds is: Did the cancer already spread to other areas in her body? The pet scan she had earlier in 2017 showed that it was in 7 or 9 (don't remember which for sure) of her underarm lymphnodes (left breast.) The other scans and blood tests that have been performed haven't shown a tumor marker increase. There's another Pet scan coming up at the end of the month, but the anxiety is killing us.

Based on what I described, does it sound like her cancer did spread to other origins of her body? like we got it too late? I know everyone knows what I want to hear, but I wouldn't mind hearing an objective opinion favoring one side or another.. She has no other ""stage 4 symptoms"" that I've read, ""just"" this pain near her pelvic area, but the pain seems pretty bad..

thank you for any insight"

                                                &gt; I Am Don Juan

&gt;Well, hello there. Please come in and let me tell you a little bit about myself.

&gt;As you may notice my environment is a little on the cool side. This is to help the team, including myself to maintain optimal performance since there are high expectations for accuracy in my profession. Although the lighting is a little dim, it is somewhat soothing. With the hint of sanitizer in the air, I feel clean. Enough about the room lets move on to me.

&gt;I am known as the Don Juan of my building. For you see, ninety-nine percent of my clients are women from all ages, sizes, creeds and nations. Ah, you may ask if I have a preference but alas NO! They each have their own beauty and I am fortunate to know them personally.

&gt;After a short interview with my assistant, these lovely ladies are introduced to me in an intimate way as our bodies become entwined in several unique positions. Although they find my body cold and sterile against their nakedness, they grasp onto my arm with one hand and wrap themselves around me, waiting for my embrace. My assistant guides them into proper position, as a part of me is lowered onto their exposed delicate area. We are left alone for a few minutes in our pose.

&gt;Since I don't know my own strength, rumors have arisen that some women's knees buckle from the force of my embrace but alas that is all it is. Although a handful may find my pressure as excruciating as torture, for most it's just a minor discomfort. Regrettably, I do leave them feeling a little tender.

&gt;They call me Don Juan because the women who come to feel my embrace all have a common reason--LOVE; Love for themselves, love for their spouses, love for their children, family and friends. In return, I give them HOPE; Hope for a new beginning; hope for more precious time, hope to break their fears.

&gt;I am Don Juan. I am your Mammogram Machine.

bc,"TLDR: What stage is a TNM of pT2(m)pN1(sn) with a multifocal IDC size of 2.2CM and 1.1CM Grade 2 with DCIS of 3.3CM Grade 3 and two lymph nodes involved?

-------------

My Mom had a lumpectomy about two weeks ago for breast cancer and recently received the final biopsy and staging results.

The paper the surgeon gave her states that the TMN is pT2(m)pN1(sn), and I am extremely confused as too what the actual number stage of the cancer is. Since when looking online gives different results for what these numbers mean.

To give a little more information:
The tumor was mutlifocal IDC with one area being 2.2CM(Grade 2) and the other one was 1.1CM. With a large area of DCIS(3.3CM, Grade 3) in-between the tumors themselves.

One lymph node had been heavily spread to (1.3CM) and the second had only a small amount of cancer cells (0.1CM). The third lymph node did not have any cancer cells.

She is triple positive for ER/PR and HER2.

I am confused on the actual staging because for instance, [looking on the Susan G. Komen table](https://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/StagingofBreastCancer.html), in the T2N1 area checking both G2 and G3 (because I am not really sure which one I should be following) and the triple positive areas; the table shows stage 1B. The most interesting thing I have found when researching staging is the second example on [this site](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/understanding-a-breast-cancer-diagnosis/stages-of-breast-cancer.html) says that cancer that is a larger size and with more lymph nodes then what my mom biopsy showed is still 1B.

But like [this one](https://cancerstaging.org/references-tools/quickreferences/Documents/BreastMedium.pdf) and other places says the staging is stage 2B.

My Dad asked what the stage was, but I think he kind of asked a leading question that because lymph nodes were involved that made it Stage 2 and I am sure that the surgeon see a lot of people (not to how many did the surgeon see before my mom's appointment) and could have possibly gotten confused about things.

Has anyone else know someone with a similar diagnosis and can let me know what the stage is? I would like to know because I know the treatment between stage 1 and 2 is very different and I would hate to see my mom go through treatment that wasn't necessary.

Thank you for reading!"

About once a month, they come and take the money. I recently found out the Susan G. Komen foundation doesn't really contribute much to the actual cause. Does anyone have any alternatives that I could replace them with? By the way, my mother has been battling breast cancer for the last decade (3 separate occurrences) so it's something that's important to me. Thanks"
bc,"When I was 18, I found a lump which turned out to be linked with my menstrual cycle. 
My mom found a lump and had a mammogram and the doctors told her it might be the start of menopause.
My sister has a growing lump in her armpit and has had an ultra sound and mammogram a year ago and doctors told her it was no worry, but she's been putting off getting a second opinion because she's anxious. 
That's all the history I know, no confirmed breast cancer.

I've been experiencing serious breast pain for the past month, my breasts are very swollen so my bras don't fit any more, and my tissues are dense. I had a breast exam and I scheduled an ultrasound for Friday, and the doctor told me I will be let known if there are cancerous cells, since it's not a cyst. 

My concern is that tonight, my left breast in particular has been in more pain.l than usual. Feels bruised, and I am getting sharp pains. I took a look and my nipple is much darker than normal and there's no bump due to my areola being swollen, there's a ring around my areola and a swollen portion under my nipple which is white.

I'm trying not to worry, but I need some assurance. Does this sound like something that could just be normal? I have a poor diet and had my IUD taken out two weeks ago after it gave me a lot of issues (all the symptoms of pregnancy without being pregnant). Was inserted December 2015. 

I live in Canada. Is there any way for me to have an ultrasound sooner? I have a requisition form."

I have IDC (5 lesions total) and had a partial mastectomy and reconstrucrion in one breast with a breast reduction in the other breast 10 days ago, here in Texas.  I have been trying to taper off the pain meds but pain at the incisions is still intense and burning when I don't keep up with it.  I really want to stop taking the pain meds.  (I do not take pills well, even vitamins of any kind, ever. I have an awful choking reflex and choke on pills)   I've had surgery before and the worst of the pain was gone around or before day 7 , not with this surgery.  They prescribed to me:  1 or 2 Hydrocodone 5-325 TB every 4 to 6 hours and said to supplement with 2 to 4 Ibuprofen every 4 to 6 hours.   It barely works on the pain but I've been taking them.  The bad news is the pathology came back, the margins are not clear and now I  have to have a full mastectomy in 5 weeks.  My doctors don't seem to understand my discomfort taking pills or the lingering pain I am having.  I need to know if something else better or easier to take is out there.  Do you have any ideas for me?  Yes, I have just forced myself to take the pills, no it hasn't gotten any easier.

bc,"About 3 years ago I found a lump in my breast, the lump feels quite large, is painful at times and you can feel it through my clothing if I were wearing a sports bra and a t-shirt. I struggle with anxiety so when it came to bringing it up to my doctor I was always too scared. Last July I finally got the courage to say something to my doctor, she thought it was nothing and gave me an ultrasound referral. It took me a while to make the ultrasound appointment... I didn't end up making it until this past April.

On April 22nd I had an ultrasound done, the technician didn't say anything. I spent the day thinking that if they call today, something's wrong... if they don't call, i'm fine. My doctor didn't end up calling that day so I thought I was in the clear, then she called the following Monday saying I needed to come in and see her the following Monday. I immediately started freaking out, because my mother had told me they wouldn't need to discuss my results if it were nothing... I ended up switching the appointment to Wednesday afternoon because I couldn't bare the anxiety. I needed to know. 

I got to the doctors Wednesday, and honestly had prepared myself for the worst. My doctor ended up telling me ""I **think** it's a fibroadenoma, it's a non-cancerous tumour"" I was relieved, but still concerned. She said it's very common for women my age. She told me that we could either come back in 6 months, do another ultrasound and monitor it - or I could see a surgeon about a biopsy. I told my doctor that I would rather just remove the lump and have a biopsy done once it's out. My doctor made the referral for me to meet with the surgeon and that was that. 

On May 11th, my doctors office called me saying that I had an appointment with a specialist(surgeon) on May 12th at 9am. This was alarming to me. It seemed very odd that the surgeon wanted to make the appointment for the next day, but it could have been because it was available. 

Yesterday, I went to the appointment and the surgeon pretty much said immediately that she wants to take it out. She also said that there are actually 3 tumours in my breast, 2 of them together measure to 6cm. She didn't mention the 3rd tumour. After doing a breast exam and asking a few questions she began telling me her diagnosis of the lump - she said ""So based on the ultrasound and the exam I just gave, I believe that it's a form of cancer... it doesn't spread, but it is cancer."" I then asked her what the name was and she said ""phyllodes"" and I recognized it as something I had seen when looking up fibroadenoma's that is very rare and can be misdiagnosed as a fibroadenoma. After hearing her say that she thinks it is cancer, it kinda clicked in my head why the appointment was made for the next day and why she seemed very adamant about getting it out. She said that after the surgery if there is still something weird about it, we'll have to go back in. 

My surgery is scheduled for June 1st, it's a partial mastectomy. I still don't think it's hit me that I could have breast cancer, people are trying to calm me down by saying that it might not be - but with the interactions I had with the surgeon... it didn't seem like she thinks it's benign. 

Now that I've explained my story, does anyone have any advice or stories about their lumps... I feel like I just need to hear more as there isn't much out there about Phyllodes."

Today, I found a large round lump in my left breast. I have started my period. I am freaking out because I cannot get to a physician until the beginning of the new year.

I'm not asking for lots of money but just for you guys to possibly help me out, thank you"
bc,"She's newly diagnosed with breast cancer, but she's been battling brain cancer for 6 1/2 years.  I've reached the point where I avoid asking scary questions in her presence, and I never see the doctors without her being there, so I don't know what to expect.  

She's about to have a lumpectomy on a malignant tumor that is a little over 1cm.  It's one of those situations where it was caught early, but that may not mean much in her case, because the standard treatment is chemo after surgery.  She can't have chemo, because she's overdue to start a new course of chemo for her brain cancer, which takes priority.

It's not like the breast cancer won't be treated.  They're talking about radiation following the lumpectomy.  But that only treats the local area.  Chemo is intended to kill bits of cancer in the rest of her body.  

We were told that there's a 20% chance of metastases in coming years if she doesn't get chemo.  But I don't know if it tends to come back more aggressively when it returns (as brain cancer does) or how they monitor her over time (mammograms won't catch it if if's not in the breast), or how they'll deal with new tumors if she still can't have chemo.

Do any of you know what to expect from triple negative cancer without chemo?"
bc,"About two weeks ago, my mom found a lump in armpit, so she went to the doctor. The doctor looked concerned and scheduled her for a mammogram. So she has that done and they said that they found a mass in her breast and two enlarged lymph nodes.

I don't want her to have cancer. I'm so scared.  Thanks for listening."

Doing a research of ginsenoside Rh2 in Chinese market, JINXING capsule is a Unilateral product only, others are compound products. Except ginsenoside Rh2, compound products contains other ingredients or other ginsenosides. Whatever of unilateral products and compound products, they have its own merits.

&amp;nbsp;

Regardless of the dosage form(injections, capsules, powders and others), JINXING capsule is A single measurable ingredients, function is determined and full play the effect of ginsenoside Rh2. There is no intestinal load which caused by ingredients during absorption, thereby affecting absorption effect.

&amp;nbsp;

Ginsenoside Rh2 compound product contains other ingredient except ginsenoside Rh2, which is no rigorously verified, Absorption and utilization rate will be low, the effect of adjuvant therapy remains to be seen.

&amp;nbsp;

What is function of ginsenoside Rh2

&amp;nbsp;

JINXING capsule mysterious ingredients is ginsenoside Rh2, which efficacy is reflect by ginsenoside Rh2. What is function of ginsenoside Rh2? 

&amp;nbsp;

1.Enhance immunity
Many people know the side effect of low immunity. Ginsenoside Rh2 can enhance immunity is by enhancing immune cell activity, such as the killing activity of Lymphocytes, T cells, macrophages and others, enhance the monitoring of the immune system to prevent the invasion of harmful substances and bacteria. 

&amp;nbsp;

2.Relieve fatigue
Fatigue is due to the accumulation of human lactic acid and other metabolites, which leads to muscle tension and exercise durability decreased. At the same time, due to the accumulation of carbon dioxide and stimulate the nerve center, which leads to sleepy, yawning, sluggish and other performance. Ginsenoside Rh2 has relieve fatigue function is by increasing the body's glycogen reserves, reducing the consumption of glycogen, reducing serum urea levels after exercise and inhibitting the increase in blood lactate levels after exercise. 

&amp;nbsp;

3.Anti-tumor
The reason of ginsenoside Rh2 caused by scholars attention is anti-tumor effect. Many literature and experiments have prove it. But now, there is no ginsenoside Rh2 products for medicine use.  

&amp;nbsp;

4.Other effects
Ginsenoside Rh2 also has health care functions, such as antibacterial, improve cardiovascular and cerebrovascular insufficiency, regulate the central nervous system, enhance memory, anti-aging and so on. 

&amp;nbsp;

JINXING capsule mysterious ingredient is ginsenoside Rh2. Just look at it, ginsenoside Rh2 is indeed a good thing and a modern Chinese medicine molecular medicine, which is a small molecule structure and should be able to play the above effects. At the same time hope that the friends who take this JINXING capsule can have good effect and longevity.

                                                    破解今幸胶囊的神秘成分

&amp;nbsp;

今幸胶囊是何方神物，如今这么多人在吃，今幸胶囊是何种神器，能延缓衰老，缓解疲劳？让我们来破解今幸胶囊的神秘成分。

&amp;nbsp;

今幸胶囊的成分 

&amp;nbsp;

起初我也一直以为，这么厉害的今幸胶囊，一定是有特别的成分，复杂的成分组成，谁曾想，看过了该产品的介绍以后，竟然是如此低调，单一的成分。

&amp;nbsp;

今幸胶囊的成分是人参皂苷Rh2和淀粉，每粒胶囊125mg，其中人参皂苷Rh2含量为20.25mg，含量比例为16.2%，甚至以上，符合人体对于人参皂苷Rh2的最佳吸收含量。

&amp;nbsp;

笔者对国内市场上，网络上的诸多人参皂苷Rh2产品进行了一个小小的调查和对比，今幸胶囊是国内唯一的一款人参皂苷Rh2单方产品，其他的产品都是复方型，除了含有人参皂苷Rh2以外，还含有一个其他的成分，亦或者其他的人参皂苷成分。

&amp;nbsp;

笔者也了解了一些关于药品的相关知识，对于单方产品和复方产品有了个初步的认知。在笔者的认知看来，两者各有千秋。

&amp;nbsp;

比如说：在不考虑产品剂型的情况下（针剂，胶囊，粉剂等为剂型），人参皂苷Rh2单方产品今幸胶囊，成分单一可测，服用功效确定，并且能将单一成分，也就是将人参皂苷Rh2的功效最全面，最大限度的发挥，不存在成分间在吸收时造成的肠部负荷，进而影响吸收效果。

&amp;nbsp;

人参皂苷Rh2复方产品，含有除人参皂苷Rh2以外的成分，虽然看似更加全面，实际上却没有经过严格验证，吸收利用率也会偏低，作为日常保健可以吃一些，辅助治疗的效果还有待观察。

&amp;nbsp;

人参皂苷Rh2有何种功效 

&amp;nbsp;

今幸胶囊的神秘成分只是简单的人参皂苷Rh2，因此，它的功效就是靠人参皂苷Rh2体现的，那么人参皂苷Rh2有哪些神奇的功效呢？

&amp;nbsp;

1.提高免疫力 
人体免疫力的重要性就不需要我过多叙述了，免疫力低下，会造成什么影响，许多人可能比我了解的更全面。人参皂苷Rh2能提高免疫力，通过增强免疫细胞活性，比如淋巴细胞，T细胞，巨噬细胞等的杀伤活性，来增强免疫系统的监听功能，防止外界有害物质、细菌的入侵。

&amp;nbsp;

2.抗疲劳   
疲劳是由于人体乳酸及其他代谢产物的堆积，导致肌肉张力下降，运动耐久性降低。同时由于二氧化碳的堆积，刺激到神经中枢，引起瞌睡，打哈欠，精神不振，瞌睡等表现。而人参皂苷Rh2能增加人体的糖原储备，减少糖原的消耗，降低在运动后产生血清尿素含量，抑制运动后血乳酸含量的上升，达到缓解和减轻疲劳作用。

&amp;nbsp;

3.抗肿瘤  
人参皂苷Rh2目前受到国内外学者的重视的一大原因就是抗肿瘤功效，已经有很多关于人参皂苷Rh2抗肿瘤方面的文献和实验证实了这个结论。只是目前还没有作为药品应用的人参皂苷Rh2产品。因此，此功效暂且不提。

&amp;nbsp;

4.其他功效  
人参皂苷Rh2还具有抗菌、改善心脑血管供血不足、调节中枢神经系统、增强记忆力、延缓衰老等保健养生作用。

&amp;nbsp;

今幸胶囊的神秘成分是人参皂苷Rh2。只是这么看的话，人参皂苷Rh2确实是一个好东西，不愧是现代化的中医中药分子药物，是小分子结构，应该能发挥上述功效。同时希望服用今幸胶囊的朋友都能有好的服用效果，延年益寿。"
bc,"I have lost 2 women in my immediate family to breast/ovarian cancer (one diagnosed mid-late twenties, died a decade later), my mom is a breast cancer survivor, and all the other women in my immediate family have had preventative procedures. Many/most tested positive for BRCA gene. I'm the youngest woman in the family. I'm about to enter school with a high debt and 4 years of training to do a job in surgical field highly related to use of arms+fine motor skills of hands. Its a very physical job. If I dont have the surgery now and I decide to have it after taking on debt and schooling the next time I could have the surgery would be right after graduation, when I'm 28. Have any women had trouble, after the initial healing phase of a double mastectomy, with being able to hold arms upright or use hands for intricate things for long periods of time? I have the ability to change my career now (would not be able to change later) if I have the surgery now and have problems, but this surgery is much earlier than I wanted to have it and it would all be preventative. Is this an outcome of the surgery I should be worried about?"

I'd be most appreciative if people could add others that aren't on this list.

bc,"Hi all. My mom has been diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time in under a year. She had a lumpectomy the first time and will be undergoing a mastectomy with reconstruction this time around. Of course it's 100% her decision what to do with her body but I'm worried sick and wish she wasn't doing the reconstruction just because of the extra trauma of more surgery (though I understand it). I've been through my own cancer journey (colon) and know everyone has to make the decisions best for them. 

SO, seeing that my cancer surgery was pretty different than what my mom will be facing I was wondering if you all could recommend any helpful things you had/bought after surgery that made recovery easier. Just ingenious little tips that you wouldn't have thought of until you unfortunately had to live through it. Thank you all so much. Sending my love!!!"
bc,"Capsular contracture after radiation
I have recently had a bilateral mastectomy and tissue expanders put into place. I am worried about capsular contracture on my breast that was previously radiated. There are already spots that are indented and very hard in that breast only a few days after surgery. Is there any way to reduce this risk and/or reverse it?"
bc,"I am 33 years old. My plastic surgeon sent some tissue he removed during a breast augmentation to a pathologist, I have ADH. Exact wording from pathologist is:


Flat epithelial atypical and focal minimal atypical ductal hyperplasia/ 
Columnar cell changes/
Fibrocysric changes/
No lesions or masses are identified


My mom had breast cancer 8 years ago at the age of 62 (survived!).  Cancer was estrogen positive. 


I’m currently waiting for a referral to a breast surgeon. Aside from checking for lumps regularly and yearly mammograms, is there anything else I can do? I have Kaiser for insurance, they were a huge pain in the ass to deal with when I had melanoma and I had to fight them just to get the initial biopsy. I’m scared they won’t be aggressive enough. I’d like to have further testing done and have a double mastectomy if that’s an option. I’d like to be tested for the BRCA gene, if insurance refuses I’ll gladly pay out of pocket. 


Any other tests I should request? Has anyone had ADH turn into cancer?"
bc,"I understand that personal stories don't count as evidence, but may help none the less. My mom has stage I ER + and HER2 + breast cancer. Tumor in one breast, 1.6cm. She is putting off surgery and radiation (the current recommendation from her doctor). Wondering if anyone here put off treatment and what the result was. Thanks."
bc,"I had my last chemo in August. It was Taxol and left me with numbness and tingling in my fingers and toes. My oncologist said that there wasn’t much that could be done and it may or may not go away on it’s own. 
Seven months later and the tingling in my feet is subsiding but it seems to be getting worse in my hands. Also, my hands ache terribly. I’ve been advised to up my dose of Gabapentin to 600mg from 300 but that isn’t really working. It’s affecting my work as a medical assistant. I’m thinking of turning to medical marijuana for relief.  Has anyone else done this?"
bc,"My mother is having a double mastectomy on Thursday, and I need to know what to expect? How do I take care of her.
Hi. 

So, I found this out yesterday, I'm pretty poor at emotions and the like. So I mostly just shut down. I feel selfish. I am pretty scared. So far we don't really know anything, just that she has surgery on Thursday and will probably be home by Sat, and then we wait two weeks for results from that before knowing what the plan is with chemo and radiotherapy. 

I know everyone's recovery is different, but I really think she is trying to soften it for us, which I understand. Telling me to just be around on Saturday and then go back home on Sunday. I feel like this is a massive surgery, she is getting reconstruction done at the same time. I just want to be realistic and be able to take the time off work ( I live a few hours away and can't drive ) to be able to care for her. It is likely that she won't be able to do anything at all for about 4 - 6 weeks right? She is fit and healthy in general. 

Has anyone gone through this? What should I expect, obviously making food, taking care of house things that is all pretty clear to me. But other things, will she be able to move at all? Will she be able to walk up stairs? I feel like we kind of know what to expect with chemo, but I think the recovery from the surgery is going to worse than we expect."
bc,"I received the call today (Friday) at 11am that I have an invasive grade 3 ductal carcinoma. I found my lump three weeks back, immediately got into my OB, got referred to the radiologist, then biopsied and now I’m here. My radiologist is who broke the news. She is sending my contact info to my surgeon and now I’m stuck waiting for her call, which probably won’t come until Monday. I have no idea what my plan is and I’m scared. I do have family support, but no one I know has been through anything like this before. Just looking for some friends that may have some guidance."
bc,"For the past 2 plus months, my nipples have been itching most of the time. It started with one nipple and 1 month later the other one caught it.
 
symptoms experienced-

itching
swollen or erect nipples
flaking 
minor weeping during first month

Have never been pregnant or breastfed, not pregnant for sure. Been to a GP with some concerns and was prescribed rather potent steroid cum antibiotic cream. symptoms eased after 7 days of use bit came back 3 days after stopping the cream.
I have a background of eczema and family history of breast cancer (mum diagnosed in her late 50s).

1 plus month into this issue, went back to GP and had an ultrasound, found no lumps or masses.

Nipples have always been really huge and dark for a fair person like myself (which mum pointed out was strange considering I have not breastfed or been pregnant before). since experiencing this problem, it just got worse. I understand nipples come in different shapes n colour and all but wondering if this is within normal boundaries. The GP didn't want to comment. After normal ultrasound, she just suggested visitng a dermatologist. 

Currently still experiencing nipple ""hardness"" and itching, some flaking few times a week. I am wondering  if I should go to a breast specialist or insist on a biopsy etc. 

Sorry for the long post, any opinions are appreciated!"

bc,"I'm dealing with a harmless looking pain under my armpit for more than 8 months, one doctor checked it by hand and in that day it wasn't painful so the doctor said it's nothing.
Few months later I occasionally had a stinging pain under my armpit and a bump, is this already an alarm? 
Would like to hear similar experience
I'm planning to go to different doctor and ask for ultrasound and mammogram"
bc,"Hello everyone, I am hoping you can help me, help my mamma. If this is not allowed, I apologize (please just let me know and I will promptly delete).

Almost exactly a year to the date that her mom was diagnosed with liver cancer, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a lumpectomy in February, a few days after I gave birth to my second daughter. Unfortunately the cells spread to her lymph nodes and she began chemo last week. 

To try and be there for her, while juggling a newborn, and a preschooler, has been...brutal, to say the least. Basically my husband has to take paternal leave in order for me to be able to travel the 45 min so I can physically be there for my mother and family. This means he will only receive 40% of his pay. He is the breadwinner. I have a side business, but it does not guarantee income. 

We started a GoFundMe to try and cover the financial gap, so I can help out my family while my husband cares for our eldest (she is 4). Any amount is incredibly appreciated, or even if you could just share the link, as I know not everyone is in a position to financially donate. 

https://m.gofund.me/escgj-help-us-help-my-mom

Another way you can help support my family, is by purchasing anything from my shop (I sell natural, handmade toys). I am in the process of making a ""pink"" line with special edition dinosaurs, unicorns and breast ornaments. If you do, use the code ""FCANCER"" for a discounted price.

Thank you, it has been a hell of a few years....thankfully I have two beautiful girls that keep me and my incredible mom, going. ❤️"
bc,"Hi everyone! I have created a blog to educate and inform everyone on different types of cancers. I just created my first post on breast cancer and I included treatment, preventative methods, diagnostic tools, and much more. It would be a pleasure if people were able to take away information from the blog and gained insight. I hope everybody enjoys it! The link is: acancerousworld.wordpress.com"
bc,"I had radiation but no chemo.  As a result of the radiation, I now have radiation induced neuropathy.  The neurologist says the radiation burned and damaged my nerves in my Brachial plexus and they will never heal.  
I only had stage one cancer, and now because of the treatment I’m in a lot of pain and disabled.  Before radiation, the oncologist and radiologist said I’d be back to normal in 3 weeks. Now they say I’ll never work again. I’m only 45.  
The doctors say the amount of radiation was correct, but everyone reacts differently.  Long lasting pain after is a possible side effect of radiation, but I was never told. 
Wish I had never got radiation.  
Any other breast cancer patients out there have radiation induced neuropathy? I’m told I’ll be on painkillers the rest of my life, that there’s no fix for this."
bc,"Keeping in mind this is just from the last 24 hours. At her request, we have not told anyone except immediate family so there is no one I can talk to tonight, including our rabbi. She wants to wait until we know for sure -- and even then keep it on the down low.

On June 14, 2012 my (then) 41 year old wife had a lumpectomy at stage 1. Margins were clear, she went through chemo and radiology at top NYC area hospitals and we thought bullet dodged.

March 2016 -- while roller skating with our daughter she is taken out by a 5 year old and fractures her wrist. No tests are done and she chalks it up to the post cancer meds she is taking reducing the calcium in her bones.

6/1/16 - she has a colonoscopy and all is good.

July '16 -- she starts feeling pain in her abdomen. No appetite. She makes a doctor's appointment, but then feels better. Then feels worse and finally sees the doctor this past Friday.

Doctor tells her to go to the ER for scans thinking she may have  gallstones. Next thing she knows she is being admitted because it looks like the cancer has come back and is in her liver (she has not had a drink, save from 2 glasses of wine, in the last 4 years).

She had a cat scan this morning -- results not in yet -- and a liver biopsy Monday. 

We've read what we can, including liver pain and lost of bone density being indicators, and it doesn't look good. I'm optimistic but realistic. She's a fighter but is also realistic. Our children are 15 1/2 and 11 1/2. 

For those in/ or have been in our shoes: If the results come out as expected, should we would be focusing on the short term or long term? I mean you never know what treatments might come up. 

On one hand, you only get one ticket at life. I'd rather go for broke making my wife &amp; children happy in the short term then prolonging the inevitable. On the other, my emotions are incredibly raw right now and I just want someone to tell me it will be ok, that there is hope. My wife is already in the former. My MIL is no help -- she makes Droopy Dog to be an absolute cheery person. I've looked at some studies and see hope, but obviously can't can conclude until the docs give a diagnosis.

I'm putting up a brave face for my family but I am scared shitless of just the thought of my wife not being here very soon. Not just for me, but for our children. We haven't told them yet (nothing to tell at the moment) but they are starting to suspect this is serious (I think they are in denial). I am finding it hard to be cheery when my eyes are constantly teary.

Anyway, thanks for listening."
bc,My mom just got trough surgery last week (one breast removed and a three lymph glands). We're waiting for the resoults if chemo is necesary. She's thinking about refusing chemo treatment. Is this a wise decision? Any experiences?
bc,"My sister was diagnosed with stage 2ish breast cancer 4 days before her 29th birthday this past January. She has always been super healthy, never smoked, never fooled around with drugs, ran multiple half marathons, etc. She will be undergoing a mastectomy in two weeks, shortly after her 1st wedding anniversary with her husband who is thankfully, awesome, however his sister passed away from breast cancer after a 4 year year battle in March. Sorry this is a bummer, hope it's the right place to post. I just want to know what is helpful/not helpful/ how to be supportive for a loved one battling cancer. I would be extremely appreciative of any feedback, thank you"
bc,"I'm 21 I've always big (5 or 6 cm) hard lumps in both of my boobs for a long long time ever since I was 13 or 14. My left armpits starts to feel itchy lately and it never happened before. Other than that, I don't feel anything over the years. They only hurt when I squeeze them hardly. do I have breast cancer? it's been in me for so long can it still be treated? thanks"
bc,"My poor mom had to be hospitalized on Monday after receiving chemo a week ago because she had a fever, a bad yeast infection, and low white blood cell count. I was alarmed when my dad called me and told me this. I live far away from her and I'm 15 weeks pregnant , so this sucks.

Anyway, she's angry that she can't come home yet. Because of her yeast infection, she has to stay for the reminder of the week. She called me up crying and severely upset last night. I told her she needed to calm down because it will cause her to not heal as quickly as she needs to. She got angry at me and hung up on me. When I apologized, she yelled at me and told me I lack empathy. 

I called her this morning to tell her about the baby because I had a prenatal appointment today. She was very short with me, snapped at me for not being able to understand her on the phone, and told me she's lost patience with everyome but my dad. It hurt. I have been asking whether or not I should come down, but both her and my father told me not to. 

I feel like an inadequate daughter and that she hates me. My dad called me last night to tell me that I didn't do anything wrong, and not to take her personally. It's hard to do being pregnant. So I am depressed, and don't want to get out of bed. I wish she didn't have to go this. I hate cancer and hate that it's taken my mom away. I want her back."
bc,"I had a mammogram on Friday. When the tech was telling me what the notification steps would be, I panicked. I felt that something was wrong, but then I thought, this must be the same information she tells every patient. Today (Monday) I got a voice mail to call the imaging center. They asked me to come in for an ultrasound.

I'm kind of freaking out. I feel nauseous and sometimes teary. I know that it could be nothing. I just read up on ultrasound and saw that you may have a mass, or it may just be a fluid-filled cyst. I have 2 more days to freak out. I'm trying to tell myself that I have to wait for the results, that I could be ok, but I'm still worried."
bc,"Hi r/breastcancer, I'm a student at the University of Waterloo in Canada and I need your help with a school project to help make lymphedema management easier. 

My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012 and is now cancer free, but she has lymphedema in her left arm.

So my question for you guys are:

What are your top 3 concerns with wearing a compression sleeve?

ie. What prevents you from putting it on, knowing that it's a chronic condition?

Thanks so much, everyone! Look forward to hearing your suggestions!"
bc,"32, waiting for my ultrasound. Need some support
Like many posts on here, I am waiting for my ultrasound. I found a small lump two weeks ago while randomly feeling my breasts, and my doctor confirmed it was about 1cm. Told me not to worry, but is sending me for an ultrasound. The breast centre at the hospital near my office is wonderful, but it also means I have to wait until May 25. My doc has booked my results follow up for June 4th so all in all, It'll be a month before I know anything definite!!! 

I am lucky to live in Canada, and Toronto specifically which has amazing  hospitals, but The wait is awful, but I am trying to keep myself busy and active so I don't sit here and think of it. Just wanted to vent my fears in hopes of finding people going through the same waiting game."
bc,"I told her I will care for her two weeks following her surgery. Any tips or suggestions? I will be cooking for her, so any foods to avoid or include?"
bc,"Long story short, after my mom being diagnosed with estrogen and progesterone hormone positive breast cancer (About 5 cm tumor in right breast, lymph node near breast  positive for cancer; CT Scan and bone scan showed no signs of speration of cancer) doctor advised to start of with Anastrozole, arimidex to control estrogen growth and possibly shrink the tumor before removal surgery. Any other thoughts of what could be a newer and better prescription for this? Because doctor said ""this drugs has been used for centuries now"""
bc,"My mom was diagnosed with stage 2 invasive ductile carcinoma. She went to Cancer Center Treatment of America and they suggested chemotherapy to reduce the size of the tumor followed by mastectomy. While chemo sucks, this treatment method is pretty standard from what I understand it seems to work fairly well. My mom is very skeptical that chemotherapy will do more good than harm. She has pretty much set her mind on getting natural therapy, which involves ozone therapy, vitamin C, and this ""miracle"" drug called poly-MVA instead of chemo, all of which looks to be total bullshit. I have tried so hard to convince her this will probably not work, but she is very stubborn. Is there anything to suggest these therapies will work at all? I honestly don't know what to do."
bc,"I need help, I need to take action as soon as I can. A lot of people is achieving complete remission these days. How can I save my mom? How can I save a life? I can't afford to lose this one precious soul, I will fight for it. Her cancer has metastesized to her bones (spine and skull) and some on her liver. She takes perjeta as her palliatative chemotherapy. For all those happy survivors out there, I cry for help. What worked for you? Pls help

After chemo, my mom started having a tingling pain on her skull which didn't occur before until she had chemo. Would that be a sign that the cancer is reacting to the treatment? Need help

The things I'm teaching her right now is to cut sugar, drink only alkaline water, lots of vegetables, no processed food, graviola tea, turmeric, hot water with lemon.

bc,"So I've recently reconnected with this girl I used to be best friends with in high school and there seems to be some problems going on with her at home and at school so we've been talking a lot lately.  I was talking to her over the phone today and she really didn't seem right like there was something clearly wrong. She told me that she got tested for breast cancer and she tested positive but since the test was through her schools clinic she isn't going to believe it until she gets a more reliable test an actual hospital. 

As of now she has only told me and her mom and I really don't know why she would tell me and I really dont know what to tell her. today I pretty much just told her to stay positive and keep her hopes up. If she does actually have breast cancer though how should I go about keeping her positive? My go to in like less serious situations is to try and make them laugh and smile, but I really don't know how to go about this. Any advice would be appreciated."
bc,"Stage 3 breast cancer
Stage 3 ductile carcinoma. Two tumors the largest is 1.9 cm juxtaposed to a smaller one. What should I know and what is my outlook?"
bc,This past Thursday I noticed my right boob had been hurting and the next day the pain felt unbearable. I was in the dressing room and I saw I had a bump on my nipple that looked like if you popped it puss would come out. My sister suggested it was either an in ingrown hair or it was infected since I previously had my nipples pierced except I closed it a little over 2 months ago. She tried to pop it but it hurt and then the pain came back but even worse this time. I couldn’t get up because it hurt too much to move. The next day it didn’t hurt as much but I noticed it was red all around the nipple area. I put neosporin on it for a couple days but now it doesn’t look like the bump is ready to pop and the texture of my nipple looks different. I’m getting checked this Tuesday as soon as I get paid but I did want a second opinion. I don’t want to assume the worst and i apologize if this is in the wrong forum topic but I’m getting worried now. This photo is from today.
bc,"I found a quarter sized lump at 7o clock on my right breast early this year and in March I had an ultrasound at a Proscan Pink Ribbon Center. The doctor told me it was a fibroadenoma and I shouldn’t be worried. It was 2cm in width and less than 1cm in height, rubbery, and moves when you touch it. I was relieved and felt a lot better about it.

Now, this past month before “shark week” I had a new pain, whenever my shirt moved my nipple a certain way, it felt like it was tugging at the lump and it felt almost like a sharp pinch. It only lasted two days and went away. So I decided to finally schedule the 6 month follow up. 

Today was the follow up. I couldn’t figure out why I felt so nervous, like I knew something was coming. I was sweating in the little gown before the imaging no matter how much I tried to calm myself down. Imaging was okay, I had pain when the tech pushed the ultrasound wand (not sure what that’s called) down on the lump and around it, which I didn’t feel last time. She sends the images to the doctor and calls me in. It turns out the fibroadenoma has grown and she recommended an ultrasound guided biopsy. She stated it was not an emergency but should definitely be done in the next couple of weeks. (Merry Christmas to me)

As a 21 year old I am very nervous, I have no idea what to expect as I’ve never had a needle anywhere near my breasts. The doctor said they would use a needle and “clip” and I’m way too scared to look up what that is. I just came home, dropped on my bed, and sobbed.

I would love some personal experience stories and advice. I live with just my father and my relationship with my mother can be... strained to say the least. My mother has fibrocystic breast tissue and my paternal great aunt had breast cancer. So family-history-wise it could go either way. I also have ovarian cysts, in case anyone knows if that could be a factor. 

TL;DR Follow up ultrasound on breast lump determined it has grown and I will need a biopsy. Very afraid"
bc,"I am an 18 year old male in university and I scheduled an appointment for an ultrasound but missed it. My university health insurance was going to cover the ultrasound, but now that I am going home for break I won't be able to make another appointment until January, since my referral is for a hospital in my college town. I just wanted to know if my breast lump is typical for breast cancer.

I have a hard lump under my left nipple that hurts when you touch it. Also, there isn't any discharge or blood coming out of the nipple. I originally found it in the beginning of October, but didn't get it checked out until late November at my university health center. The reason being that I had a similar lump back when I was ten years old that just went away, but this time I wanted to be sure. My lump seemed to get larger in size and hurt more, and a small skin bump on my nipple grew (same color as my nipple, not very noticeable), which then caught onto my shirt at times and then stung a little when it was pulled on by the shirt. I later accidentally ripped off the skin bump, and that left a small red dot for about a day. By the end of November the bump hurt less and seemed to shrink a little (I think, not entirely sure), but now it still hurts. Has anyone else had similar experiences? Any input is greatly appreciated."
bc,"I'm a 20 y/o male. I've had gyno for years because I took risperdal as a kid, and I'm overweight.

My gyno breasts are unknown size because I'm overweight. But I'd say they're on the upper side with what is possible with gyno.

Anyway, I have a small lump in my right breast, maybe a centimeter or two. I've never checked my breasts before, but I recently gained another 20 lbs and hey we're bothering me...

Anyway, nobody in my family knows I have gyno. And I've never been diagnosed. I've been trying to get it on the low low.

I set up an appointment with my primary, who I never saw before and that's a month from now.

I have OCD so I can't stop thinking about this, and I put myself in an early grave without even knowing if it cancer.

I'm thinking about going to a mobile clinic for those without insurance and they can see me Tuesday. But I'm super embarrassed. A male going to a doctor, saying they have gyno, and found a lump...

It's a very embarrassing thing.

What should I do here?

bc,"I created a new username to protect my anonymity. I want to share just a bit of my story and some pictures of my final result because that was helpful to me when I was going through it all.

In August 2011 at the age of 31 I had a bilateral mastectomy as treatment for a diagnosis of breast cancer. The next 9 months involved the grueling process of breast reconstruction. Since I lost both nipples to the mastectomy my plastic surgeon used a skin graft taken from my abdomen to recreate the shape. The only step left was to tattoo color to the nipples and as soon as my grafts were well healed I could have that done. 

Instead of completing this process in the summer of 2012 as planned I was diagnosed with a second primary cancer. This time it was Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia which is a highly aggressive and immediately life threatening blood cancer. My life, my job and my plans were all put on hold as I was moved into the OSU James Cancer Center to begin the several months in total that I spent inpatient for intense chemotherapy  treatment. My body was not able to handle the chemo. My heart, lungs and brain became unable to function properly. After just 7 months of the prescribed 2.5 years of chemo it was decided that I would need to have a bone marrow transplant for a chance at a cure. The complications I had suffered so far were too dangerous. In January 2013 I was once again checked into the hospital for a several weeks stay and I received a gift of bone marrow cells from an annomynous donor. This was far from the end of the story but now I can see that it was the beginning of the end. Another year and many complications and hospitalizations later I was still cancer free and getting stronger and even thinking about the future. One of the first things on my mind was finishing the breast reconstruction with tattoos. Completing that process was essential for my healing and becoming whole again. I was given approval by my oncologist and I went back to the plastic surgeons office.

While my plastic surgeon is amazing at creating breasts from nothing it turns out that his office is not the best at tattoos. I ended up with a flat color that was all wrong for me and hard edges that looked more like nipple stickers than a part of real breast tissue. I found Ron with a desperate Google search for a person within driving distance who would be willing and have the talent to make me look a little more like the me I remembered. After consulting via email and looking at sketches I drove with my family from Columbus to Wickliffe for my long awaited appointment. Ron welcomed us into his clean and well organized shop. He took time to get to know me and make sure I was comfortable before we began. Due to the desensitization and scar tissue I felt no pain as he proceeded with his art. He surpassed my expectations by correcting the first tattoos, creating dimension with shadowing and adding distinctions that closer resemble human features. With his ink he gave life to my flesh.

I’m going to be getting chemo soon for my stage 2 Her2+ Est+ Proj- breast cancer. Just had lumpectomy surgery. Tumor was 2.5 cm. 

I have been given an option between 2 chemo regimens:

Adriamycn Cytoxan + Taxol Herceptin Perjeta 

or

Taxotere Carboplatin Herceptin Perjeta

One doctor said Adriamycn was a terrible drug side effect wise, so I should do the TCHP routine.

Another said the AC + THP has been around longer and will have a slightly higher chance of killing the cancer and preventing relapse. And since I’m so young, I will be able to tolerate the side effects.

Halp!

I don’t know what to choose."

I had no symptoms...just went in for routine mammogram.  Got a call back to do a magnified localized mammogram plus ultrasound followed by biopsy.  Biopsy confirmed DCIS.  The high grade kind has a high risk of recurrence.

I just don't know if doing a double mastectomy is overkill.  I know I DON'T want radiation, but they said if I choose a lumpectomy, then I have to have 30 full breast radiation treatments with a risk of damage to heart and lung on that side.

Does anybody have experience with this decision and what kind of recon did you receive?  I'm considering tissue expanders and implant recon with skin and nipple/areola preservation.

bc,Hi. My mom is 63 and was just diagnosed with stage 1a.  We have a follow up appointment with the doctor to discuss further but apparently he has  stated  that they  can treat the cancer with a lumpectomy and radiation - no chemo.

bc,"Hello.
On Dec. 23rd, I noticed a pain when my right breast brushed against the edge of my desk.  I took note, but didn't think anything of it.  Since then the pain has become constant, and any kind of pressure and the pain is just awful.  No lumps that I could tell (I try, but I've never been good at self-exams), but it's definitely gotten more firm or thicker.

I called my doctor's office on this past Friday, and never received a call back.  I called again on this past Monday and the nurse told me she was never informed of my call.  She spoke to the doctor, who said that since I already have a Gyn appointment on the 16th, bring it up to them and have them check it out.  Until then, hot compresses and Advil is their advice.

Am I overreacting, or is he not taking my concerns seriously?  I'm 44, only one member in my family had breast cancer that I know of (an aunt).  I don't think its cancer (or at least I'm convincing myself of that) but I would think my concerns wouldn't be passed off on another doctor.

Is being sent to the Gyn normal procedure?  The nurse mentioned he might have sent me for an ultrasound, but when she called back, it was just home care and my Gyn appointment.  Suggestions appreciated, and I hope you all have a pleasant day."

bc,"MRI (step3) found benign mass and now radiologist suggests going back through mammogram (step1) and ultrasound (step2) Why repeat tests that sent me to mri in the first place..?
In 2016 (34yrs old) I had a sharp breast pain that never left. No lump could be felt, it just hurt. I gave it a few months, and no change. I went to the dr who scheduled a mammogram and an ultrasound. 

I received a letter in the mail, shortly after, informing me that I have extremely dense breasts and the results were inconclusive. I figured my physician would let me know if needed anything else, and I just moved on. 

In 2018, my mom was diagnosed with stage 0 cancer and got a lumpectomy and in a conversation she brought up the state mandated letters being sent because dense breast tissue can hide cancers. 

Uh oh.. I messed up. I should have followed up. so I make an appointment again with my provider. Pains the same, so I get an mri with contrast. 

The dr calls me 6 hours after the mri, which freaked me out. The radiologists report says benign mass found in the painful breast and to get a mammogram and ultrasound..

Why would I loop back around? What makes it benign? So many questions. My physician also wanted more information and tried to reach the radiologist but he had left for the day. So we wait.. 

In the meantime, I am just trying to figure out why if it’s benign as he stated, I would need additional tests. And also why would he want to repeat the mammogram especially? 

Any insight?"

My question is: are there any home services that are free (or close to free, affordable for someone on a fixed income), that she can take advantage of to help around the house or with chores? She starts chemo soon, and as weak as she already seems, this is going to really put her down for a bit. My wife and I are willing to help as much as we can, but 7 days a week is quickly going to put my wife in a bad place health-wise.

bc,"Hey everyone,

As the title states, I just learned that my mom has Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the breast.

Early this year she started having complications with a benign cyst which she eventually had removed. Her would wouldn't heal at all, and kept becoming swollen. She opted to have a mastectomy to relieve the pain and swelling, and later learned last week that her cyst was actually cancerous all along.

She's been told that 4 of 9 lymphnodes are affected at the moment. Her doctors are telling her it's still a very good prognosis.

Doing a little research myself (bad idea I know) I learned that 2 year survival rate is 80%, and 5 year is around 70%. This is a lot better than I thought. I think this may have all been assuming though, there was no lymph spread, as the website said this type of cancer typically doesn't spread easily.

But in the months of her being told it was benign, it must have spread. I'm a little worried now that her prognosis will come back not nearly in the high survival rate stated on the website because it's spread.

Apparently it's very rare.

Anyone have personal experience or have family members with this type of cancer? How did you or they respond to treatments? What kind of treatments?

Thanks."

bc,"Lump, nipple discharge, already had ultrasound & nervous
Hello all,

I had a sort of red mark on my breast a few days ago, and a lump. I decided I should get it checked out, particularly since I’ve had some nipple discharge (yellow brownish) and some weird changes in my period and a family history plus some risk factors. My doctor swabbed the fluid and ordered an ultrasound which I’ve now had. It’s not fluid filled like a cyst or abscess but the radiologist said he thought that although there was heterogeneity in the lump he still thought it was most likely a fibroadenoma but that I need to follow up with a clinician who deals specifically with “lumps and bumps.” Ultimately I was told to wait for the formal report Tuesday. I missed a call a few hours after the ultrasound from my primary care doctor; I’m assuming, in my nervous mind, that the swab wasn’t bacterial and instead was for cytology and she has the results. Left voicemail asking that I call the office but it was too late to call back. I’m just still nervous despite the radiologist’s comment. Anyone have a similar experience?"

I go in on Tuesday and this weekend will be filled with anxious worrying."
bc,"Hi all, 34 year old female with no known family history of cancer (but only because I'm adopted and don't know any family health history). About three years ago after losing about 20lbs, I discovered a hard, immovable, pea sized lump in my LEFT breast right where my breast tissue meets the skin over my ribs. I had no healthcare at that time so I just passed it off, figuring it was probably just a cyst. Presently, it is still with me. It hasn't gained or lost any size and is still in a fixed position. 

Except I now have two obvious indentations  approximately 3 inches away from the lump in my armpit area and a moderately sized indentation on the bottom of my LEFT breast about 3 inches from the lump on the bottom/outer edge of my breast. The area in between the indentation on my breast and the lump is painful when prodded but NOT to gentle touch.

The armpit indentations are easily visible when I raise my arm straight over my head while the breast indentation is easily visible when I bend at the waist and let my breasts hang freely. At first I doubted the appearance of the breast indentation, as you can spot other  indentations that appear 'ropey' on my right breast but those obviously follow the natural creasing of my hanging breast tissue. The breast indentation is an obvious area where the tissue appears sunken while hanging (which truthfully just looks odd).

Also, I don't know if this is worth noting but I might as well, I have extremely obvious veins across my chest and breasts and an area about 1 inch by 2 inches of discolored skin above my RIGHT areola that looks like a bruise which I first noticed in August. Otherwise I have no strange lumps or indentations or pain associated with my RIGHT breast. 

Is any of this worth worrying over? I figure if my little lump was cancerous that it probably would have grown at least a little in the last 3 years but I'm no doctor. Thanks in advance."

bc,"Hello. My mother in law was recently diagnosed with stage 3b (now most likely stage 4) invasive ductal carcinoma. She delayed treatment for herself for about 8 months and refused to even get it biopsied and she has hidden the extent of her condition from us. This has made helping and advising her difficult. She now has a 3inx3in fungating wound to the breast with significant exudate. Naturally we are all worried sick about her.

From the onset she has refused orthodox methods of treatment. No surgery, no radiation, no chemo. She instead opted for a raw diet, vitamin c injections, hyperbaric therapy, hemp oil, and a whole host of vitamins and supplements. I want to make it clear that her reasons for opting out of these therapies were due to a chronically weak immune system and heart problems. She truly believes that her body would be destroyed by any orthodox methods of cancer eradication. Furthermore she was not convinced that the prognosis in late stage BC was any better with treatment vs without so she opted for the alternative route. Initially it actually seemed to work. The tumor shrunk precipitiously. However she lost a great deal of weight and had no energy. She then switched to a ketogenic diet (high fat, moderate protein, very low carbohydrate) which has shown some efficacy in asian research studies against cancer cell proliferation. Her energy improved but the tumor worsened and she didn't tell us it was getting worse until well after the breast had opened into the fungating wound.

We are all frustrated and frightened. We support her decision not to go through the chemo/rad/surgery but we also don't want her jumping from one snake oil ""cure"" to another until she's too far gone for any help at all. I've watched some of the videos she has cited her info from and it is shocking the amount of misinformation that is available to the public. Heartbreaking to know that there are people lying to and profiting off those who are scared and have no medical knowledge base. I've gotten to the point where I don't know who or what to believe anymore and even her son is despondent. Treatments backed by significant research have not worked for her and we suspect that no matter what she is not following any regimen with real consistency.

Now she wants to fly to mexico to have Insulin/chemo therapy done. The only research I can find on the subject was conducted by the group marketing it which right off the bat makes me skeptical.  I tried to tell her that 1) the research wasn't independently conducted and this not likely valid and 2) in her present condition she would not tolerate a plane ride well. She didn't listen. Though she is considering another place in the US that does the insulin therapy in addition to natural killer cell therapy.

I'm just so tired, everyone. I don't know what to tell her anymore. She wants our input on everything but if we tell her something looks like quackery she gets pissed and does it anyway, then panics when it doesn't work and asks us about something else. Any advice at this point is welcome. Please help...I'm at a loss."
bc,"Hey all, I'm new here. Just got diagnosed on Thursday (triple negative receptor, stage 3, right breast, 4.5cm lump, awaiting my BRCA results) and am getting a chemo port put in on Monday to start chemo very soon.

I am 31 years old, have one 15 month old son and am 24 weeks pregnant (Due 8/31/18) with a second baby. I have done some research about what's to come but I am also just trying to take everything one day at a time because my anxiety takes me to terrible places. Anyway. I was told I would start very soon on AC chemo (sorry if some of my terms are incorrect, I was at doctors office all yesterday and it was very surreal so still sorting things out). 

I was told that I would stop chemo about 6 weeks before delivery and then I would start up after the baby arrives to finish out my treatment. I have read a little bit about chemo and I know that I will not be able to breastfeed.

I was wondering about bed sharing though. I read that you have to be cautious after the chemo treatments (flushing twice, washing sheets if any bodily fluids get on it, etc) but I wondered is bed sharing allowed? Are the chemicals so intense that this might harm a newborn and/or my toddler son? I'm trying to find answers here so I can prepare myself for what's to come. I will be attending a chemo info session this coming week but I  would love to hear from women who have been through this and I guess just hear some feedback. I'm not interested in opinions about the safety of bed sharing overall, strictly about the potential affects to a newborn and potentially my toddler son. 

Also interested in any other topics that maybe I'm not thinking about in regards to doing all of this with a newborn and toddler.

Do I talk to her? I don't want to come off like an ass who thinks she *should* do something. If she said - ""these are my scarred tits"" then OK - but I feel like I cannot mention it (and yes, i have tried).

If I have to ignore this my whole life it will still mean the best decision I ever made was to marry her - she is everything to me. But I'd like the hive mind to see if this is me tryiong to make it about myself (in which case I would be horrified and try and change) or, there's a way in which we can both share in this.

I don't know. Posting in reddit, so that tells you something I suppose."
bc,"Feels silly to whine here, but my wife of 20 years just got diagnosed with invasive ductile carcinoma this last week. 

In general, I handle major disasters in life pretty well but this one has me scared and I'm not scared often. 

Trying to positive and supportive to her, but gotta say my insides feel pretty broken right now. 

Sorry for the random vent, just trying to find places I can let pieces of this out so I don't come completely apart at the seams."
bc,"I'm venting here because I can't do it anywhere else. Not a friend, but more than an acquaintance diagnosed over a year ago with inflammatory breast cancer. I'm
a very long/term stage IV survivor of IBC. I've had numerous recurrences and mets all over the place. I know how not fun this cancer shit is.

NAF/MTA started complaining of pain in her ribs back in May. Pain got progressively worse so breathing, sleeping, lying down, standing and now walking are difficult if not impossible. Repeatedly she was asked when she was going to get scanned, get to the onc, start investigating the issue. Repeatedly she said she was fine. It was her bra, insomnia, bad back, etc. She finally went and no surprise, it's bone mets on the spine, ribs and sternum.

Mets are absolutely not fun, but they are treatable, the pain can be managed and these mets can be treated as just a chronic issue. BUT NOT WHEN THEY GO UNTREATED FOR FIVE MONTHS!!!

The tumor burden is significant, mets are all over the place, this means higher dosages of drugs for longer periods, potentially more radiation, she allowed the pain to get really bad and now it takes more and stronger drugs to get the pain under control. She risks the pain burning a path along the neurons that makes stopping the pain much more difficult. 

All because she didn't want to face the idea that the cancer might be back. Her choice to ignore the obvious may very likely have cost her her life.

If the pain, discomfort, feeling that something isn't right, give it two weeks. If it hadn't resolved itself in two weeks, go to the onc. Obviously if things get severely worse in that timeframe, get to the ER. 

I don't know what her outcome will be, but I am angry and sad and tired knowing her fear and inability to face reality likely will cost her her life."

They exposed breast cancer cells to [the blessed seed](https://theblessedseed.com/learn-more/cancer/) extracts, the breast cancer cells were inactivated whereby they concluded that the blessed seed had promising results in the field of prevention and treatment of cancer."
bc,"Hello all, so last fall my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, lucky for us it was found very quickly and completely removed. Hooray! She received Chemo and Radiation. After her surgery we found out that she suffers from a side effect known as [Lymphedema.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphedema) 

She has it in her arm. She goes to physical therapy and wears a sleeve. I was wondering if anybody has any kind of advice I could pass on to her about it? She is a very energetic and positive person, but I know that at times she gets upset knowing that she has to deal with this symptom for the rest of her life. 


Any advice will be appreciative!  Thanks!"

She had biopsy two weeks ago because of some bulp in the breast. Today results are that is malign mucosse adenocarcinoma ER+ PR+.

Has anyone here used or know someone who used Tamoxifen to cure/reduce their breast cancer? The Dr. just recommended it to shrink a stage 2 tumor and then to extract it for my best friend.

Since starting chemo, the pain has gotten much worse. It sometimes even keeps me up at night. It feels like a radiating pain through my breasts and lymph nodes. It almost feels like my breast tissue is being electrocuted. I have mentioned it to my oncologist and nurses, but they shrug it off. Is this pain normal? It freaks me out sometimes.

bc,"Hello everyone! Little background I'm a 31 year old mom of 2 small boys, no immediate family history of breast cancer. I found a lump in my right breast sometime in mid April, but it was close to my period so I left it alone, fast forward to the week after my cycle and it was still there, so I made an appointment with my obgyn to see what he thought. This morning was the appointment. He told me it was nothing to worry about but then asked if he could remove the fluid with a needle to check the color. Well I said yes, and no fluid came out, just little pieces of tissue that he put on a slide, he punctured it several times. So reading up, I'm seeing that cysts are fluid filled and tumors are not. I'm just super worried too because he said if it was a cyst that it would go away with the aspiration and the lump is still there. Any advice would be appreciated."

I'm only 20 years old, I know nothing about breast cancer. Everything on google is terrifying and inconsistent. I would love to hear from anybody at all here that would know anything about this. Thank you for reading and please send some prayers or good vibes in her direction, thank you."

I can't feel anything in the area they were looking at. Results were that it looks like scar tissue (I had a pretty bad bruise on that breast a few months ago). The radiologist is concerned though because there is dimpling. Being sent for a mri next week and have a biopsy scheduled for the week after. I'm freaking out but trying to stay distracted. 

Update - My MRI showed no malignancy and I'm in the clear. Short term follow up in 3-6 months (mammo and MRI) just to keep an eye on things. 2 different radiologists looked at it and had the same conclusion. Best wishes to all here and thank you for the support."

A good friend has just been diagnosed with breast cancer, and she has three children at home. Her husband is very supportive. She is to have surgery soon (date not set). I come from a medical family with patient and familial experiences with cancers, and we were instructed by the doctors in the family to never ask how someone is doing and to interact with them as you normally would. Do nothing to remind them of their condition. We have always followed this practice. Is there any advise you could provide to help me be supportive of my friend as she goes through this process? Are there things I definitely should not do? I hope this post does not cause any negativity to anyone. Thanks for reading this."

bc,"on 01/14/18 i went to the walk in clinic because of a breast lump in my right breast. the doctor on call faxed my papers to the hospital within our area and within a week i had an appointment for an ultrasound which was today. before she faxed the paper off i read her notes which included ""2x2 cm"" which was the size of the lump.

i went in for my appointment at 8am this morning. got the ultrasound which included lots of images being taken from the screen. when she was done she said she had to go talk to the doctor because ""usually the arent able to go mammograms on women my age but because the lump is prominent"" she wants the doctors opinion. sure enough the doctor says i need the mammogram so they take me up to the unit and i get ready.

once i get in the room the nurse starts to ask me questions. she asks me if im on any hormones. i say no. asks if im on birth control. i say no and shes gives me a weird look. then she asks me if im sexually active and i say yes. asks me if i could be pregnant and i say no, i havent had sex since my last period ended on 01/05/18. she says she has to go talk to the doctor as well because there is a CHANCE i could be pregnant (theres not)

i sit in the waiting room in my room for 15 mins waiting for her to come back and then when she does, she tells me she wont give me the mammogram and instead i have to wait for a letter to be mailed to me, and then after i get the letter i have to book the mammogram within 10 days of my next period. 

so basically im like.. this is insane. if i have cancer youre adding 2 weeks - 2 months to my waiting time.. depending on when i get my next period and how long the letter takes to get to me.


anyway. im trying not to worry (obviously) but given how quickly they wanted to give me the mammogram (even though im well under 40 with no breast cancer in my family) it all seemed urgent. is it normal to have such a  run around and the whole possibly pregnant thing?

This is my first post here, I apologise if I write anything in appropriate and I thank you all for taking the time to read my post.

Over the last few months my left breast has been increasing in size - whilst my right breast has stayed the same. Sometimes my left breast feels hot and itchy. I went to my GP and she could feel a lump (6oclock under my nipple), so she sent me off for an ultrasound.

Went to have my ultrasound today. I have been given copies of the photos. 
I can see several black ovals on my photos - which from my research I believe are cysts. 

What did your ultrasounds look like? Could you see the cancer? Had the tech ‘highlighted’ and measured them as such? 

I want to understand these images because the stress and waiting is so hard.

For reference - I am 28 years old, no children, not on birth control. My mother passed of bowel cancer at 38, and my Father passed from prostrate cancer at 56 (was diagnosed around 50)."

bc,"Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.   

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part. 

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous. 

If you would like to take part, please click the following link. This will take you to the survey and study information sheet. 

Link: http://www.domystudy.com/survey/index.php/841983?lang=en

As a thank you for your time, we will enter you into a prize draw where you could win a £50 Amazon voucher, or even an iPad Mini.

Thank you,

Rosie

Grade: One
Couple lymph nodes positive
Cancer has not spreaded.
BRCA Negative. She's not carrying any genes.

Then one time every week for 12 weeks. Which totals at 5 months. She already had the port placed yesterday. And now will start the chemo treatment, surgery then radiation then arimidex pills for years. Is this treatment too much?"

bc,"When our mom was 29 and we were in elementary school, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and at the age of 32, it took her life.  This obviously left a deeply profound impact on me and my sister.  So much so that 5 years ago when she was 20 and I was 22 we got tested for the BRCA1 &amp; 2 mutations.  I tested negative but she tested positive, and she was so shaken  up by the test results that she called me over to her place and wept in my arms for about 5 minutes before she calmed down. Now whenever we try to talk about her risk she tears up (and on top of the trauma of seeing our mother suffer and die from the cancer she has generalized anxiety disorder) so it's almost impossible for us to talk about it. Feeling that she got the short end of the genetic ""stick"" I promised her that I would stand by and be there for her no matter what.  Given her risk factors, her gyno recommended that she start getting yearly mammograms at the age of 25 and having recently turned 25, she scheduled her first appointment.  She then called me and said that she wanted me to come with her because she was very nervous about the exam (both that it would be painful and more so the fear of the results because the radiologist reviews them right after the exam).  To clarify, she specifically wanted me to be in the exam room with her.   I asked her if they would allow me in the room given the radiation risk and she said that she already asked and they would be OK with it as long as I stood behind the shield with the technologist.

I'm absolutely furious at these (Vancouver) ""practitioners"". She's been giving them thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars and is now at the point where she is missing actual appointments because her back pain is so severe. 

My wife is currently taking care of her and has been telling me some of the ""treatments"" they're selling her and when I look them up every one of them is dubious at best but primarily they are utter horseshit. 

A short incomplete list:
 
*photon sound wave - allegedly to ""devitalize"" and get her cells all on the same frequency

*vitamin drips - they take hours and cost thousands

*hyperbaric treatments - putting her in a pressurized chamber

*various ""herbs and spices""

*dietary restrictions and supplements

They started a gofundme yesterday which has -amazingly- already  collected more than $10k because she's such a well loved beautiful person. I'm afraid a large part of this money will end up in the hands of these snake oil salesmen when they find out about it.

I don't know what to do but I had to leave this somewhere. Its possible they didn't do any real harm but they told her they've cured cases like hers and I'm afraid they might've caused her to allow the window for real treatment (read: actual medicine) to close as the last time she saw a real doctor they told her chemo is no longer an option when before it was ""we will not do surgery until you've done chemo"". 

I'm so angry I'm in tears. Is there no legislation in place to protect vulnerable patients from salesmen like this? The products they sell should require a disclaimer stating ""This product will not cure cancer"".

I know some people find emotional comfort in these alternative treatments, some of them might have an effect, placebos can be very powerful etc so I don't want to offend anybody.

Please just someone say something.

bc,"Hello! I am 35 years old and I´ve just finished treatment (two surgeries, 8 chemo cycles, radiotherapy) and am now facing something new. My ex boyfriend just confessed to me that the real reason he does not want to keep up the relationship, despite us being so perfect for each other, is that he doesn´t want to ""look at my body"" for the rest of his life (even though he is very much attracted to me). According to him he would rather deal with the pain of losing me than live with me and my body as it is. I know the first thought is ""what a jerk!"" but I realise that I have to face some new issues that I have been avoiding. How do I deal with new relationships with my ""new body""? How do I talk to guys about it? How do I overcome the fear of being rejected after this? Is it possible to be loved for who I am?
I´d love to hear what your experiences were, whatever the outcome. I feel so alone in this, my friends do not understand when I try to talk to them about body image.

EDIT: Hi guys! Thank you so much for your beautiful messages! Your support means alot to me and your inputs are so very useful! I am however very much at ease with my body, ironically breast cancer freed me in a way, and made me look at myself in a whole new loving and accepting way. I never felt so confident and sexual. That´s why I was so surprised with my ex´s reaction! What I don´t know what to do is how to deal with possible romantic involvements in the future. A guy won´t know from the start that I had cancer. When should I tell him? How should I tell him? Should I tell him at all? As much confidence as I may have about myself I really don´t want to go through this kind of conversation every time I meet a potential lover. I know I might sound a little bit shallow. I feel like I have been divided, cancer has given me such power, such a sense of who I am, that I don´t care what others think of me, but at the same time, I don´t know how to make it a ""natural"" part of the new me without frightening people who come close to me."

The lump is about an inch long by an 1/2 wide. It's hard but not painful by touch. I'm really scared and don't know what to do.

bc,"My mom told me last night that she got a diagnosis of stage 1 breast cancer, earlier this week. From what she says, it's non-invassive and not in her lymph-nodes... two tumors under 2cm. Some of the details are a little bit vague from her- apparently the appointment where they gave her the news was imediatlely following a dentist appointment where they pulled two teeth and she had had pain medications, so she was a little fuzzy on some details. Her husband absorbed enough to say ""the prognosis is good"" but didn't write anything down. So I'm sorry for the lack of specific details. I'll know more when I go with her to her surgical consultation next week. 
Here's my big question: I'm the oldest of three. My youngest brother has down syndrome and lives with me. Our middle brother is scheduled to move across the country at the end of May. Our mom is 65 and has been in intermittently fragile health, in the past several years...I'm a single mom of three kids 9-14 yrs old. Last night my brother asked me if he should postpone his move... he and his wife have worked really hard to save for this move and it means a lot to them, so I encouraged him to follow through with it. But the more I think about it the more I worry that our mom is going to need more than I can give, alone, and that I wont be able to support her the way she's going to need.  Should I ask my brother to stay for awhile more? I don't want to fall short for our mom by falling into the old habit of being the family martyr. 
Those who have been through treatment for stage one breast cancer or who have been through it with their loved ones- how intensive is this going to be and how much help is my mom potentially going to need? 
I'm so grateful that this was caught as early as it was. i know this could be SO much worse. But it's still scary as hell, so I appreciate any advice."

I am going to visit my Aunt (out of country) for Thanksgiving; she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. By the time I see her she would have gone through her second round of chemo. 

I don't get to see her often because of some issues my dad and her have, but I don't want to show her I'm a different person than my nuclear family. She is very excited I am visiting! :) 

I want to bring her some presents. So far I have a coloring book and a bracelet. I know right now she is always tired. Honestly, I just want to help. My parents went there and didn't help at all. My plan is to go there and have an ""American Thanksgiving"" and just show her a good time.

My mom finally went to the doctor after experiencing fatigue, chest pain, and bronchitis that just wouldn't go away.
Initially, the doc found a small cancerous tumor in her breast and the lymph node near her armpit. She walked out with a Stage 2b diagnosis. She mentioned the chest pain, so they ordered a pet scan and found a small tumor just near her breast bone.
 She didn't tell me if it was in her bone or lymph node. It's hard to get her to be honest about what the doctors are saying. She's trying to protect me and my sister.
 My Dad has been obsessively Googling cancer lifespans and assumes its spread to her bone and that she has Stage 4. He says she has years, not decades. He isn't sleeping, and his behavior worries me more than my Mom's.
My real questions are: is it possible that the pet scan could have just found the other tumor in her chest was  in her lymph node, not her bone?
Will stage 4 really give me less than five years with my mom?
She's my person and the idea of not having her hurts too much.
How can I support my family without making them feel insulted or weak?

Because I have only one family member (that I know of) who has had breast cancer, he won't order the test.  He suggested I pay an independent DNA testing service - 23 &amp; Me, etc. - to do the tests for me.

Has anyone gone through a similar situation, and if so, which service did you use?  Thank you all in advance."
bc,"I'm sorry this is a very long story... I'm updating it as we go... I would really appreciate it even if you read only the last update and reply with any thoughts or suggestions. Thank you and God bless.

My mom (50) felt something under her armpit right breast. Went in for mammogram couple weeks later. Doctors saw a tumor approximately 1.4 cm they said. They ordered a biopsy right away. After a week doctor called my mother and broke the horrible news to her. The tumor is hormone positive (estrogen and progesterone positive). Also the lymph node was cancerous as well. Days later we met with the oncologist and she said that doctor told her at the time of the biopsy he felt tumor was bigger than 1.4 cm. It's more like 4-5 cm... They performed a CT scan and bone scan to check if it has spreaded anywhere else. My whole family and I are all in fear, although I'm trying to keep everyone positive and worry free but it's still pretty hard on us because it's first in family... We have a meeting with doctor and oncologist this week. I want to be prepared and ask the right questions such as treatments and questions about this cancer in general. Im willing to do anything to help out my mom. I started researching all kinds of different diets... (Alkaline, low asparagine diets...) She's not overweight or anything but like I said any help I can provide for her and help her beat this!! Please help me, help her!! 

Update: 02/25/18 // The oncologist called us and said that according to the CT scan, everything looks clear (Thank God) but the bone test showed one suspecious area (left iliac pelvis). Oncologist recommended MRI just to double check on that. She also hinted that the doctor would like to start with hormone pill therapy to shrink the tumor for about 3-6 months then surgery and remove it.

Update: 03/10/18 // My mom did another MRI for both breasts. Tumor showed to be bigger. (8 cm) also MRI on the pelvis. Still can't tell if it's cancer or not. Also bone test was done check on density of bones.

Update: 03/19/18 // Oncologist called again. She said after reviewing my moms case with different doctors at the meeting this time, it was suggested to do chemotherapy instead of the pills because they're not still sure if the left iliac pelvis is cancer or not... Three different tests and they still not sure... I told her that were looking for second opinion from different hospital and doctor... Idk what to do anymore.

Update: 03/21/18 // Had a meeting with the oncologist. She went over all the tests and scan results all over again. She said based on the latest MRI test of breasts and whole body. The tumor is 8cm and also shows 4 other lymph nodes cancer positive. Tumor is hormone positive. It has nothing to do with her2 positive or negative. Tumor is also a very low grade. (Grade 1.) Pelvis still is unknown if it's cancer or an age related fracture. Doing biopsy on it wouldn't be so easy because it is an very small area... So the whole plan changed based on the second hospital staff meeting. Now the recommendation is AC-T Chemotherapy FIRST. AC part will be standard 60ml given every 2 weeks x 4 cycles. T part would be once a week for 12 weeks. Then surgery and more likely mastectomy... Then arimidex pill therapy where it can go for 5-10 years... We're on our way for a different doctor and second opinion.

Update: 03/21/18 // Spoke with a different oncologist. This doctor is truly God sent! Right away he asked to get the all the medical records from all different hospitals and doctors... After looking at the most recent exams and tests he said he agrees nor disagrees with the previous oncologist; however, he called a very known radiologist to see if it's possible to do an biopsy on the pelvis bone. And the answer was yes. My mom is scheduled next week for the pelvis biopsy to see if it's cancer or not. Also doctor said to stop with the Anastrozole pills so biopsy results are more accurate. He also ordered an BRCA test. First day my mom didn't take the pill after 2 weeks now...The tumor is 8cm big already. It couldve been growing for a very long time and my mom still physically healthy and young so it wouldn't hurt to put a stop to the pill for little bit to get more accurate results. As of right now my mom is kind of against chemo. I did research as much as I can on what could be done instead of chemo... 

Update: 04/16/18// Spoke with the oncologist again. BRCA test came back negative so that means my mom is not carrying a gene and wasn't passed to her from previous family. Doctor said since my mom is young and in an healthy shape, do the full ACT chemotherapy regimen. That's to shrink down the tumor from 8cm to a reasonable size so with surgery they're able to remove it or possibly a mastectomy since it's big. Now, the tumor is grade 1, has not spreaded anywhere else and it is Estrogen and Progesterone positive. Doctor said since it's not anywhere else in the body, this is the best option and it is curable! My mom is afraid of chemo but now it's two doctors that have recommended the same thing. She's willing to do it but any other thoughts and questions I can ask the doctor for the treatment? 

Update: 04/23/18// Last update before chemo. Went in today for the port placement. It took about 1-2  hours total... Everything went well. Port was positive placed a the opposite side (left) of tumor. Approximately 7 days, she will start the chemo. She's still not happy about chemotherapy but knows that it will help her instead of hurtting her. God willing everything will go smoothly."

They all had breast cancer and increasingly younger ages. My mom was diagnosed in her mid 40’s. After two mammograms I had a biopsy today because of a small cluster of calcification. I passed out right as he finished and then I didn’t stop bleeding for 45 minutes. I’m feeling a bunch of emotions that I’m having trouble dealing with. What helped you until you got the results? They said probably Tuesday."
bc,"23. Aspiring career in surgical field. Fine motor movements after double mastectomy?
I have lost 2 women in my immediate family to breast/ovarian cancer (one diagnosed mid-late twenties, died a decade later), my mom is a breast cancer survivor, and all the other women in my immediate family have had preventative procedures. Many/most tested positive for BRCA gene. I'm the youngest woman in the family. I'm about to enter school with a high debt and 4 years of training to do a job in surgical field highly related to use of arms+fine motor skills of hands. Its a very physical job. If I dont have the surgery now and I decide to have it after taking on debt and schooling the next time I could have the surgery would be right after graduation, when I'm 28. Have any women had trouble, after the initial healing phase of a double mastectomy, with being able to hold arms upright or use hands for intricate things for long periods of time? I have the ability to change my career now (would not be able to change later) if I have the surgery now and have problems, but this surgery is much earlier than I wanted to have it and it would all be preventative. Is this an outcome of the surgery I should be worried about?"
bc,"Hello all. I've posted here before about the worry that I might have breast cancer. Well, fastforward, I do have breast cancer. I am a 29 F with Stage 1. Grade 2. Under 2cm lump. No spread or lymph nodes. Her2 and Est positive, Proj negative. 

I recently learned that I will need to do about 4 months of chemo, surgery, radiation, and then I'll have to take Tamoxifen for 10 years. 

The thing that bums me out the most is that once the Tamoxifen starts I'll no longer be able to do Wellbutrin. For me in particular, Wellbutrin has been a lifesaver. I used to be so depressed and suicidal. I had hardly any motivation to do anything. Wellbutrin gave me energy, motivation and zapped my depression. The only side-effect is that it amped up my anxiety, OCD and anger, but since fatigue and depression are bigger issues for me than anxiety, I accepted it. I also like that Wellbutrin helps with ADHD symptoms, because while I'm not ADHD, it does help me focus on my work. 

I can deal with having to go through the temporary hassle of chemo, surgery and radiation. But the fact that I'm not going to be able to get my life back afterwards really bothers me. 

Even natural antidepressants like St. John's Wort and samE are said to have questionable interactions with Tamoxifen. 

I understand my choices are Effexor, Celexa and Lexapro. I've read that Effexor makes you sleepy and has brutal withdrawal symptoms that can last for weeks if you decide to quit, and taking Celexa and Lexapro has a rare potential of giving you heart problems in conjunction with the Tamoxifen. Also, while all three of these things may do more for my anxiety than Wellbutrin, they won't have the same stimulant effect that has helped energize me. 

Advice? Similar Experiences? 

TL:DR; Will go on Tamoxifen, won't be able to take my Wellbutrin."
bc,"Hi everyone. I just got my first punch biopsy. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it is a little sore. There seems to be a lot of confusion as to what is going on with my right and left breast. I've gotten many tests done before this, and still didn't come up with a clear answer. So far all I have been told is that I have ""inflammation"". But I have other weird signs that might be pointing to IBC (inflammatory breast cancer). My nurse practitioner did the punch biopsy on my right breast, where there's a light pink patch of skin. Only one punch, and no stitches. Now I have to wait for the results and it is making me nervous. By the way, I am 33 years old and do not have children. My family has a history of cancer, but not breast cancer. Do any of you have IBC? How old are you, and what were your symptoms?"
bc,"Hello everyone,

Recently, my girlfriend, who's 27, found a lump in her left breast about the size of a golfball. On Friday, she is having a biopsy to test the lump to ensure it's not cancerous. She is understandably nervous about the procedure. And, of course, she's anxious about the potential results. It doesn't help that she likely won't get an answer until next Wednesday, as the hospital needs three business days to test the sample. (Thankfully my work is flexible and I can be with her as much as she likes.)

I love this woman and want to do whatever I can to help her through this, but I have never been in this position before. So I ask: How can I offer the best support possible?

Thank you in advance for your insight, and blessings to everyone on this subreddit going through difficult times."

Lately I have been feeling a random ache in my left breast. It actually feels kind of like when I was lactating and I’d go too long without nursing, but not quite because that was a kind of pressure and fullness and this feels more like tenderness or like I have a deep bruise. 

Last night I rolled onto that breast while in bed and it felt like I had a bouncy ball in my breast - something hard. I felt my breast and I felt a hard lump deep inside, against the muscle wall. But it’s kind of lumpy in there in general? My right one doesn’t feel lumpy. 

I made an appt for a mammogram and the scheduler seemed concerned when I talked about the pain and lump. She said to get a referral for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound, not a screening mammogram. 

My husband was looking up my symptoms and stumbled upon info about fibrocystic breasts. It seems like it could be that, but I really have no idea.

nd,"Hi everyone,

In February 2017 i started my topical steroid withdrawal, have been
using them 6-7 years before that (i am 20 now). After a week or two
after i stopped, my eczema spreaded all over my body, being oozy, raw, wet etc. I've been using calendula oil and aloe vera gel
for a month and by the April, my skin was clean.

For about 6 months, until October, i had no problems, even little ones, with my skin. But in October flares started getting back, worse than ever. In January, i've used topical steroids again for like 3 weeks and now i am like 60% healed.

My question is: when i used moisturizers every day on my skin last year, my symptoms faded away after month and a half. But this time i tried billion times to withdraw from them to accelerate my healing but that never happened - i lasted like 2-3 days at maximum. Should i use them or moisturizer withdrawal is real thing and i should stick to it?"

nd,"Ok, hear me out on this one.

So I was reading through the Mysterious Missives (quick shoutout to u/PushEmma for your post debunking the odd/even Gilneas lore post, and for exhorting everyone to read up on Blizzard's lore for themselves), and I realized there was some small amount of lore, albeit very cryptic lore, on some of the more intriguing Hearthstone-exclusive legendaries--Lady in White, Splintergraft...and Countess Ashmore. Not much is known about this supposed noblewoman. No one can recall her lineage ever having existed before the curse, but when she appeared, so did an official record of her extensive family tree. So, we can already be pretty sure that she's not who she says she is. If she's not a human noblewoman, then who is she? All signs point to her being, well, a dragon in disguise. 

Now, this part might not be a shocker to some of you if you've ever played the card--her helmet has horns on it (or, more likely, it's her actual head that has horns), and when you play her, you can see the giant shadow of a dragon slowly touching down on the ground before she appears on the board. That's fairly interesting in itself, but what's really interesting is how this may tie into the phantasmal serpent Baku the Mooneater.

Here's an excerpt from Baku's lore as noted in the Mysterious Missives:

&gt; Our arcanists’ initial hypothesis is that Baku may in fact be the tormented psyche of a dragon whose physical form is trapped within the bounds of the Witchwood, but outside of physical reality—some kind of dream-dwelling projection of this dragon’s mind, warped and twisted by Hagatha’s own nightmares.

Let's look back at the limited lore we have on Countess Ashmore:

&gt; Rumor has it that she’s researching the curse, and she’s been seen asking questions of those who claim to have witnessed dragons in the wood.

What does this mean? According to this evidence, there's a strong possibility that Countess Ashmore, or whoever she really is, has been affected by the Witchwood curse, causing this dragon to have powerful nightmares when she sleeps. These nightmares are then in turn corrupted by and mixed in with Hagatha's own nightmares (according to the arcanists' theories), creating the frightening dream vision known to those who dream of her as Baku the Mooneater. Though Baku doesn't exist physically, it's noted that:

&gt; those who dream of her tend to slowly descend into a fugue state—neither waking nor dreaming—and develop the ability to manifest their will in surprising ways.

So the second part explains Baku's card effect upgrading your hero power--her dream influence is able to make you more than what you were and grant you surprising power, but as mentioned in the first part, this comes at the cost of one's own will. Baku's dream power puts one in a zombielike trance in between waking and dreaming, barely lucid at all, after too much exposure. Now let's go back to the Countess for a moment! What's her entrance quote?

**""My power over you grows stronger yet.""**

That's right, the Countess is *aware* that her dreams manifest themselves as Baku the Mooneater, and that this nightmare creature saps people's free will and twists the minds of those that resist. She's gloating at her ability to manifest her power this way, and this is reflected in her card's power: All creatures of Gilneas and the Witchwood, once they have succumbed to her influence, are hers to command--whether they've been granted Rush, Deathrattle or Lifesteal powers, eventually they will submit to her as the final price, and so she draws them from your deck to be used at her leisure. 

Why is she ""researching"" the Witchwood curse, questioning people who claim to have knowledge of it and interrogating people who have seen dragons in the woods? Simple: She has full knowledge of the curse already--it's to isolate and then kill off or enslave anyone with the potential knowledge to *stop the curse from spreading.* But wait! Why would I assert that Countess Ashmore knows everything about the curse? What does she stand to benefit from the curse's continuation? Isn't she being forced into these nightmares from the curse's effect? Who IS she really, anyway?

To answer these questions, let's go back to the assertion that Baku is:

&gt; the psyche of a dragon whose physical form is trapped within the bounds of the Witchwood, but outside of physical reality—some kind of dream-dwelling projection of this dragon’s mind.

We mentioned Countess Ashmore previously as being the most likely dragon responsible for the dream manifestation of Baku, but there *is* one more notable dragon from this expansion, isn't there?

A dragon who once served Ysera in the *Emerald **Dream**,* but who was twisted and corrupted into a powerful antagonist serving the *Emerald **Nightmare**?* 

A dragon confirmed to have power over nightmares, and whose quote is **""Be reborn in the curse!""**?

Hagatha is not the source of the curse.

**Emeriss is the true source of the Witchwood curse, and Countess Ashmore is her human form.**

&gt; Reports from the few who survived encounters with the dragon told of horrifying tales of putrid mushrooms erupting from the corpses of their dead companions. Emeriss was truly the most gruesome and appalling of Ysera's estranged green dragons.

Emeriss's curse, as noted in her card text, gives her the power to grotesquely warp anything she touches, granting them immense power but turning them into monstrosities in the process. Emeriss's curse is innate, granted to her by the Emerald Nightmare, and it's now her goal to spread madness and destruction to the world by spreading her curse--the Witchwood curse--starting with Gilneas. 

However, a gigantic nightmare dragon would raise too many red flags, so Emeriss spends the majority of her time in human form as the mysterious Countess Ashmore, having ""...taken up residence in an old manor that’s been abandoned since before the first battle of Gilneas"" in order to keep a close eye on things without being too conspicuous. Even in dreams, Emeriss does not truly rest, utilizing her Emerald Nightmare powers to *deliberately* manifest her will as the phantasmal serpent Baku, and being able to further spread her curse by invading the dreams of anyone within reach and corrupting them from the inside out. 

As Ashmore, she is able to get close to the general populace and weed out anyone with the potential knowledge to stop her, but it's likely that she's unable to stop the more powerful heroes like Darius Crowley and Toki without revealing her true draconic form, so in those instances, she prefers letting her most powerful minions do the work for her: Glinda Crowskin, Captain Shivers, and yes, even Hagatha is a pawn under her influence, mistakenly believing that she herself is pulling the strings and that she controls the Witchwood. Hagatha is indeed an extremely powerful shaman, but this is why Emeriss chose her as the face of the Witchwood curse--the nightmare dragon needed both a powerful (if unknowing) servant and a face for the Gilneans to direct their anger towards while Emeriss continued to work in secret. Crowley and the others may believe that they have saved the Witchwood by defeating Hagatha, but Countess Ashmore's--Emeriss'--true plans...are only beginning.


**TL;DR Countess Ashmore is actually Emeriss of the Emerald Nightmare in human form, is the true source of the Witchwood curse, and manifests her nightmare power as the dream serpent Baku the Mooneater while she sleeps.**


Thanks for joining me on this fun journey, friends. You may now remove your tinfoil hats."
nd,"If you get super hooked on every woman you meet &amp; date, then you may have attachment issues.

I know that’s a bit blunt to start off with, but it’s so important to understand that this could be what’s holding you back from finding love.

**The signs that you have attachment issues are;**

*\* You were abandoned or left own your own a lot as a kid.*

*\* You get massive bouts of anxiety when she doesn’t message*

*\* You get attached to women that you’ve only met online or after 1 date*

*\* You jump straight into relationships &amp; love bomb the shit out of her*

This is something I’ve had to deal with in my own life.

My family tree’s all over the shop so I won’t bore you with the details, but I had a lot of people coming in and out of my life \(don’t worry, my parents are still intact lol\).

So this led to VERY unhealthy attachment issues with men \(and friends\). I’d get super needy and devalue myself just to get love, so it led to a lot of disappointment and me swearing off men for the longest time.

Eventually though, I realised that I had to face it. To go through the fire and FEEL everything to heal myself – so I spent the best part of last year doing just that.

It wasn’t easy!

It was humiliating, humbling and life changing. And sometimes it pops up but I’ve got the tools to get my head right before I do anything drastic.

But anyway, back to you.

Here are 3 ways to get over your attachment issues;

**1. Figure Out Where It Comes From**

You need to know what your triggers are.

Usually it comes from absence … of a time where your parents weren’t fully available to you. In your tiny mind, mum &amp; dad might have just gone out for dinner but totally abandoned you. So the upset &amp; fear you experienced may be anchored in your psyche.

Emotional Freedom Technique is a super powerful way to dig up those memories &amp; heal from them. I spent many hours tapping away and digging up crazy dirt from my childhood that explained a lot of why I was the way I was. 

**2. Remember, It’s Just You Trying To Control Things &amp; Other People**

When someone doesn’t do what we want them to, we go into desperation mode … trying to control them. This is where anxiety starts to surface, because it’s a reminder that you aren’t in the driver’s seat all the time.

And you can’t control other people ... at all! Because when you do, they’ll resist you &amp; pull away.

You can only control how you feel about them and things in general. The sooner you realise this and let go of this need to force things into a direction that makes you feel better … the better. 

**3. Train Your Thinking**

When you obsess &amp; ruminate you’ll end up spiralling into mental &amp; emotional rabbit holes that you can’t get out of. You MUST keep busy doing things that make you happy.

You need to move away from thoughts that trigger negative emotions … and the more you do it, the easier it gets.

Because at the end of the day, there’s a part of us that loves to indulge in this feeling. We’ve had drummed into us that if we don’t get anxious and try to control, it means we don’t care.

It’s quite the opposite. It means you care more about yourself than anyone else’s opinion of you.

nd,"I'm late for teacher appreciation week, and too early for the end of the school year (at least where I am), but yanno, whatever. Who says there are only certain days when you're allowed to be grateful?

Some of you may never know just how important your kindness can be to some students. I'll give a couple of examples (with apologies for a very discombobulated post) from this year to illustrate my point.

I've always been a bit of a ""weird kid"". That turned out to be ASD, but regardless, my quirks resulted in me being one the less popular kids (to put it nicely). Because of this I developed a terrible social anxiety, and except in those rare few classes where I have a friend to work with, I usually just do group projects on my own. So I figured that that would just continue in my AP Bio class this year, where I knew literally none of my classmates. Not so. It was immediately evident that my teacher cared. No doubt he immediately knew something was up when my only response to his question of whether or not I was okay with working alone was just an, ""I'm used to it."" He offered to be my lab partner, and though I was still to intimidated to take him up on it, I was grateful. I felt... welcomed.

It was a lab-heavy class, and of course I continued to work on my own, still accomplishing everything which I needed to, but doing twice as much work as everyone else, who had a partner.  Finally he managed to add me to a group, who we'll call Sonia and Sofia.

""NotRickyNixon, why don't you work with Sonia and Sofia?"" This made me tense up. I'd be happy to be working in a group, but I was too scared that they didn't want anything to do with me to react. I just stared at the table. He must have noticed my hesitance and known that I needed to be welcomed in by them. ""If they're okay with it, that is,"" he added.

They were friendly and kind, and became my permanent lab group. Hell, I eventually ended up on good terms with basically the whole class because of how he would gently involve me. I definitely felt a lot less alone because of how he treated me.

Then there's my English teacher. Throughout my life, I've not been used to much kindness for messing up or being emotional. At home, I've been emotionally neglected and often invalidated. And the only relationship I've been in is one where I was emotionally abused. I'd become far more used to being wounded for my vulnerability than anything else.

So I wasn't expecting much good to come of it when I went to apologize to him after having behaved rudely in the previous class. I'd figured that he'd just hate me.

Instead, he was immediately reassuring. Hell, he even went so far as to ask if it was because he had done something to bother me. That's probably a normal response, but so much more than what I had become accustomed to. It meant a lot to me to know that someone actually cared about my feelings and my emotional well-being. It showed me that I can expect people to treat me with common decency.

I know most of you only have each batch of us students for only one year. But you can make that year so much better with your kindness. So, from the bottom of my heart, thank you all so much."

nd,"Judge me or not \-\- I don't really care. I need advice.

\(I'm a dude.\)

So, no one knows I am bi\-\- well, no one involved in this story. For the last year and a half I have been hooking up with a guy with a girlfriend; they have been together for nine years. I am currently a senior in college and he has one year left but is a few years older than me due to traveling after high school. I think this is the first person I have ever had feelings for and, as someone who doesn't believe in polygamy, I don't expect him to break up with his girlfriend. He says he loves her, but has cheated on her with a girl I know as well as myself.

He said if anyone ever finds out he will cut things off, but goes back and forth between saying he's bi and that he's just experimenting. A week and a half ago one of his friends came up to me at the bar and asked if we were banging, to which I denied it. When I went back to his house he refused to let me in or talk to me. His roommate saw me walking down the street and asked me if I wanted to come over and talk with him so I can fix whatever we were fighting over, to which this guy told me to get out upon arrival. The next day he blocked me on snapchat.

However \-\- someone was catfishing this guy on grindr with his instagram pictures, so I spent the following week figuring out who it was in hopes of getting him to talk to me. I succeeded, but he still said he doesn't want to talk to me. The following day, he asked me to return a library book for him. What the hell do I do?"
nd,"After realizing the USB XBOX 360 controller's axes could only be mapped to specific functions, I dug into the data files to see if I could override them. I wanted the L and R triggers to map to Repair and Slide, respectively. In the game, it'll only let you map axes controls (L&amp;R triggers [Z axes], Left analogue [X&amp;Y axes], and Right analogue [Rx&amp;Ry axes) to specific functions (not repair and slide, in my case). In my case, I wanted to map functions to axes controls which the in-game gui doesn't allow.


Make a new folder with your new settings in:

C:\GOG Games\STAR WARS Racer\data\config\

OR just edit the files in ""current."" I made a new folder called XBOX360, copied all files from ""current"" into ""XBOX36,"" renamed current_control.map in the XBOX360 folder to XBOX360_control.map, and edited the file. To load the settings in-game, go to settings on the title screen, load/save options at the bottom, and select the new folder you've created. If you edited current, you won't need to load anything. The settings seem to be persistent on restart.

In the file, you'll see the various option, and you'll be allowed to assign functions to various axes which the in-game GUI doesn't allow you to. Here's what the joystick settings portion in mine looks like:

    ####### JOYSTICK MAPPINGS

    JOYSTICK                    ENABLED=TRUE  

You can also edit the video, force, and audio files if you wish. Force I believe is a specific type of controller, so it won't make much difference.

I still haven't figured out how to map the start button to the in-game pause. I tried entering button=8 function=pause and function=start, but it results in the controller being unresponsive. I'm assume this is because it's conflicting with the keyboard's ESC pause, or the game parser shuts down the config if it detects wrong data. Not sure...

Anyways... Hope that helps some people!

EDIT: I’ve give up on finding the pause and course map cycling in the HUD for control mapping. Using joy2key to map the buttons instead."

So it makes since that he might be Jewish. Of course this could all have to do with Ricks jokes about Mortys Jewish name, and there is some evidence to basically debunk my theory, such as in S3 E8, Mortys Mind Blowers, when Morty says things about evidence about God that could confirm him to be agnostic or even atheist. But I still think that the name and parenthesis are good evidence that my theory could be true. Discuss."

nd,"This is driving me insane, absolutely batshit emotionally drained insane. We just celebrated our 2 year anniversary, everyone thinks we’re this wonderful couple and we are when things aren’t tense but when he gets mad at me, it’s like he’s a completely different person.

I started DBT therapy in last few months and have been learning new communication methods and techniques. I feel like I’ve made a lot of progress. In our 2 years together, I’ve definitely made some mistakes and I’ve apologized each time and vowed to get better. It was often rude/snarky remarks or unfounded statements based solely out of fear and insecurity. He’s my second relationship and my last &amp; only other relationship was 4 years and traumatic and awful. I had a terrible childhood as well so I never really learned to communicate in a healthy way. I realized how unhealthy this was and got help though! I’m proud of my progress. I go to weekly therapy, read self-hook books and resources online. Now that I actually feel like I’m doing better, I feel like he has started treating me terribly and i can’t figure it out. 

It always starts out like this: I make a statement that he feels is accusatory or attacking and he immediately gets on the defensive. I can understand why he may feel this way because yes, in the past I did a shitty job communicating. But now that I make a conscious effort to make “I Statements” by focusing on my feelings, he feels attacked and doubles down on the defensiveness. Instead of telling me how he feels, he starts talking about what I did wrong (that same day, or references something that happened in the recent past or long ago?) and then he doesn’t look at me. He stares at the wall with a frown on his face. I try to get through to him by holding his hand, being gentle and affectionate or by asking what I did wrong and he says nothing. If he says something, he raises his voice and inserts “fucking” as an adjective somewhere in there. I get that he’s upset but it feels very hostile and only makes me more emotional and insecure and scared. Sometimes he just gets up to go to another room while I’m still talking. Sometimes he gets up to leave my apartment out of rage when I say something he doesn’t like. It’s gotten to a point where I’m scared of saying the wrong thing but I don’t know what’s going to cause him to get up, and watching him do that pains me in a way I can’t explain. I start to panic and hyperventilate and end up sobbing, asking him to stay. 

We’ve talked about this. I tried to send him helpful online links and asked him to please communicate with me. I try to validate his feelings the best way I can by recognizing why he may feel defensiveness but he starts making sarcastic comments and just nodding with contempt. I eventually start crying and he’s like a stone, cold and distant. Sometimes he storms out of the room or disappears into the bathroom for space, but when he comes back he doesn’t try to talk to me calmly. He’s still angry. I feel like a weeping garbage fire when he treats me like this. I don’t know why it’s considered okay to shun your loved one out when you feel attacked. If he feels like I miscommunicated or feels hurt by my wording, he should tell me this! But instead I feel like he PUNISHES me for it by withholding love and affection. I feel like his love is conditional. He threatens to leave sometimes when he gets that angry and it destroys me because my fear of abandonment is at the core of my issues.

When we make up, his actions and words stay with me for days and eat away at me, leading me to doubt our good times together. I try to keep it under control but it happened again last night after I opened my mouth and not once has he acknowledged how his actions were hurtful since then. At one pint he told me to “shut the fk up” when I asked him what I could’ve done better.

He wasn’t always like this and I am at the end of my rope. I don’t understand why he continues treating me this way after we talk about it and he apologizes and acknowledges that he was being a jerk. He literally promised me on Sunday that he wouldn’t react that way anymore and here we are, not even a week later. 

**TLDR: my boyfriend treats me awfully when he’s upset with me by getting defensiveness, shifting the blame onto me and ignoring me. I try to understand his perspective but he doubles down on the defensiveness when I try to reach out and de-escalate things but it doesn’t work, lately I just end up in tears regardless of what I say**"

**Our Community**


We are Raging Monkeys, a PS4-based gaming community, and we're seeking mature, fun-loving gamers of any skill level to join our troop! We're utterly bananas about Overwatch but also have large and very active player base in Destiny, Fortnite, Elder Scrolls Online, Monster Hunter World, The Division and Rainbow Six Siege.


Don't worry, the ""Raging"" in our name isn't because we're angry but rather because we have a raging passion for gaming, and terrible puns. We're actually a jolly bunch of friendly, chatty gamers with horrible humor and a kinky streak. If you're helpful, supportive, and just a little bit deviant then you'll fit right in... but if you're easily offended then we're probably not the family for you.


Our community consists of members from many different European and North American regions, and we have our fair share of gun-waving Americans, poutine loving Canadians, crocodile-wrestling Australians, lion-riding Namibians, and lots of other interesting people. 


**Rules and requirements**


Now, we've talked a lot about ourselves, but you might be asking yourself... what do we expect from you? Well, not very much at all.

 * You have to be mature and over 16 years old. The age rule is non-negotiable.

 * Be respectful towards other players (harassment or toxic behaviour of any kind will not be tolerated).

 * Have THE worst puns, but remember, all things in moderation. 

 * Communicate and help others (especially newbies).

nd,"TL;DR: I don’t know how to define the work that I do (or even the position at work) for my resume. I tried to detail my job functions in the listed items below. I am looking to switch jobs so wanted your guys’ help.

Hello all. I don’t know if this is the place to ask so I’ll try to keep it as short as possible. I am basically looking to switch jobs and wanted to make myself more desirable to new software companies than I was when I graduated. I had a rough time finding jobs out of college since I didn’t have internships and therefore wanted advice on how to describe what I do in terms that a regular software company hiring manager might be able to judge my abilities.

I recently graduated from a university in the southeast US with my Electrical Engineering degree. I learned a lot of programming and did a bunch of projects ranging from embedded systems to android apps. I finally found a job at my current company but wanted to move to an actual software engineering company with better pay.

I currently work at a service company (tutoring company) that uses Google Sheets to manage all its information and run day-to-day business. I had been hired as the web designer since they wanted someone in house with web experience (that they didn’t need to pay as much). But I quickly moved over to general IT (as I want to call it). Basically, I introduced the idea of using Google Sheets to maintain and manage data and, using Google App Scripting, make the process as automated as possible. We already have a POS System from Square. But since our company is a service company and we feel Square isn’t really geared towards service companies yet, I had to find workarounds for a bunch of daily and monthly functions.
My basic functions are:

* Created and maintained an active daily appointment sheet using Google App Scripting with Google Sheets that pulls data from our POS system and is a dashboard for our admin staff to perform daily duties such as charge customers for appointments, verify all appointment details, measure complete employee hours and mark special transactions for future keeping (such as unpaid tickets, prepaid customers, etc.).

* Made a system for logging daily student attendance with digital signatures. I built a custom front-end to let tutors see only their respective students every day while all the data is managed through Google Sheets.

* Created a messaging system between tutors and students (and their families) using Google’s Gmail Service. Basically, the back-end is managed by Gmail and again Google Sheets while the front-end was built to have tutors send session notes to students through an app.

* As the web developer, I also improved the website with structural updates that had to do with the fact they were using a theme in WordPress before. I also do daily updates such as putting in new hires on the website and setting up online booking for appointments.

Since our client base is quite large (around 1500 customers), after I joined, I have been able to reduce a lot of man hours through automation (I understand I might have to give exact numbers on my resume).

I apologize for the long post. Please let me know if there is a better place to ask this. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I want to go somewhere that might provide more structure and sophisticated tools and of course better pay. Thanks so much!"
nd,"So it's my birthday today, and as with every year I am a mix of hopeful and excited to receive birthday wishes from everyone, and embarrassed to receive so much attention.

nd,"So this might be fairly impossible since it's basically all based on a few fleeting memories I have and overtime it almost seems like I might have dreamed it up...

So it was a Dreamcast/PS1 game perhaps, my brain tells me it is Dreamcast but it might not be - It was late 90's or early 2000's. I remember it was an RTS, birds eye view type game where you had control over a main unit (possibly robot, mech type units?) and I seem to recall you had units (these units were tanks or something akin to that) which would advance towards the enemy base so you might not have had direct control over them. I think the camera would stay on the main unit that was you, so it wasn't a free camera you used to pan and build stuff. Thinking now it almost seems like what our tower defence games are like these days.

It was a futuristic/sci-fi era game I am fairly sure of, with 3D visuals. I also seem to picture it being a police vibe that were very militaristic in nature. It probably had multiplayer via splitscreen or something as I seem to remember playing with my brothers on it and can sort of remember the color scheme of your units being different for each player (redvsblue type thing) which might not be helpful but I am basically throwing anything I can remember in hopes someone, somehow knows of it.

 13f, my boyfriend’s 14. my parents didn’t know we were together, I didn’t want to tell them about him because I was scared of what they’d think, and they don’t really want me “dating” just yet. Because they didn’t know about us, we had to sneak around to hang out together. We usually just went to the liquor store, rode our bikes around, hung out at the park, etc etc. Considering our ages and our attraction to each other, you can guess what happens next. About 1.5 months ago we lost our virginities together. It happened very naturally and we used protection of course, we both felt really good about it. We continued to sneak around when our parents weren’t home to satisfy our horny selves, but just the other day at my house we got caught. My parents told me to completely stop talking to him and they grounded me for a month. When I got back to school the next day, I talked to him about it and we agreed that although it would hurt, we would have to break up. This held up for a week or so until we snapped and started talking again. He’s practically my only and best friend at the school, so I felt pretty alone without him. I’m stressing out now because my mom is threatening to move me out of state to my dad’s if she catches me talking to him again, but I just can’t because I just want to be with him. It’s very hard to explain what i’m feeling with my limited writing ability, just bare with me. We could honestly do without the sex, although tempting, we just want to be together. Is it wrong of me to be disobeying my parents like this, or for losing it at such an early age? I’m in a tough spot right now, I don’t know where to go to for advice."

nd,"In 2013 or 2014 I downloaded an app from Google Play Store by searching ""mindfulness"". It might not have been called exactly ""mindfulness"", but obviously something related since it showed up as a result when searching.

The app had a Greyscale (or possibly very low saturated) thumbnail of some stacked rocks, a very simple interface with a few choices like: 

Guided meditation - 27 minutes
Guided meditation - 14 minutes
Free meditation - xx minutes

Or something very very similar. I am absolutely certain that one of the choices was 27 minutes because that's the one I chose every time.

The app didn't actually contain any audio files, but instead linked you to a file on an otherwise black screen on a website. The clip started with hitting a bell two or three times with a few seconds in between, oddly loud. The voice was male, american accent, and started with ""let's first take a moment to..."" and then started with telling you to imagine a string pulling the top of your head up. It walked down the neck, onto the face, shoulders, arms, torso, thighs, shins, feet, and then up again. With each body part he repeated the same sequence of words, ""let your self take notice of what you actually feel, not what your mind wants you to feel. Warmness, coolness, pressure, tightness, itching tingling, ..... , *pain, or pleasure*"". I'm 100% certain that he always ended specifically with ""pain or pleasure"", the others are probably not in the correct order and there were way more. The recording ended with the way too loud bell ringing again.

I've gone through my previously downloaded apps on Google Play but I can't find it. Either I removed it stupidly or it might have been taken down. Either way I feel like the recording should still be out there somewhere since it linked to a website. 

Anyone familiar with the specific recording I'm talking about?"
nd,"So I told my mom I was ace when I found out I was, after I build up the courage. I did it in October I believe. We talked about it that night and never again after. But I few days ago I started to designed a few asexual pride designs and I was REALLY proud of 2 of them so I went to show them. The second one I showed her had the colors of the ace flag in it and I told her that it were (She didn’t know ofc. She’s very open minded but like almost anyone she didn’t know that every sexual attraction had a pride flag. She thought all sexualities celebrated under the rainbow flag.) After I told her that she looked again at the design and went “You should tattoo that! If you want to you’ll get that as a birthday present from me!”

I can’t tell you how excited I was to hear that! Not because I wanted to tattoo it, but because I really felt like she accepted that I was ace! I love that woman so freaking much!💜♠️💜

I’m still really excited! I might really tattoo it but that’s something I need to think about! I’m glad she accepted me non the less!


tl;dr: I made a few Ace pride designs, showed one to my mom, she loved it and wanted me to get a tattoo of it! And she accepted that I am asexual!"

nd,"Background: 25 M working in IT at a Financial firm. Came from my previous job about a month ago, where I helped engage the business on a SaaS solution. Thought the new job would be similar but it isnt.

Current situation: Not actively looking to change roles yet, but not satisfied with my current role. It plays a very operational part, but paid about 25% more than my previous role. Stumbled upon an Engagement related role at the SaaS company directly. Had a phone interview, had a in person conversation. They are ready to put an offer on the table, but we are still in a holding pattern because they are not sure if there is a clause in the MSA that is a no hire, or a no poaching. It was my goal to get in this area, and stumbled on this role. 

They are requesting that I get permission from my current manager to apply to this job. Im concerned that it would create a ton of hoopla, or put a target on my back if they come back and say no. Im more than confident that I would get an offer with an acceptable compensation package (equal if not a little less than what Im currently making).

So Im at a fork in the road, and need to take a risk. Either I talk to my manager and try to get permission, get my foot in the door officially for work I enjoy doing, or wait around another 6 months or so and look for the same job again. I would still need to potentially get approval from my manager but 1 month and 6 months are different. 

Reasons to stay at current position:
- Potential for growth projects (likely but not assured)
- Would lead some initiatives
- Just started a month ago

Reasons to leave current position:
- Lack of leadership sponsorship
- Harmonization efforts
- Projects are not recognized as projects, everything is operational. 

Reasons to Go to SaaS:
- Growing company - great time to get in.
- Get foot in the door for a desired profession
- Defined career paths (both within the department, and other areas of the company)

Reasons not to go to SaaS:
- Overqualified, potential set back. (but also would be good to learn the trade officially)"

I know it’s suggested that you wait 1-2 days before using the peel but what exactly goes wrong if you use retin a too soon before a peel?"
nd,"**Edit:** 

Reproductive organs = Sex. 


Gender = Cultural practice saying that only people of *this* sex can do/wear/like/be *this* thing, and only people of *that* sex can do/wear/like/be *that* thing. Dividing the world into two piles and telling each individual that they can only have one. You can't mix the piles. 


I'm saying that everyone deserves access to *all* the options, from both piles. 


I'm worried about being judged by people who want to keep the piles separate, but also that other people, who want to redistribute the piles but still keep them separate, will judge me for not wanting to redistribute them *their way*. 


~~~~~~~~~

Basically, my view is that gender is a social construct that needs to be gotten rid of... If you're not familiar with the thought, [here's a Wikipedia summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction_of_gender) that isn't exactly my view, but it's close enough.


I'm sort of nervous about this having an impact on my socializing with people. I feel like a lot of people would jump on me over it. I mean, I'm not going to take a male friend to my room, lock the door, and *force* him to put on a dress. But if someone told me ""I'm not going to do that, because my gender can't/shouldn't do that,"" I would, politely but forcefully, reply, ""Why can't they?"", or ""That's not an excuse.""


(And if you want to say that science has proven this or that difference between men and women, or between gay and straight people... there is no way for scientists to study these things in a way where the results aren't affected by the biases of the scientists and study participants.)


I guess I just want to get to know a few other artists who have views like this, who like to draw and write about genderless characters. I want to be able to talk about... my stories, things I watch and read, real things, history, *anything*... without worrying about coming up against a gender-essentialist view, and then either having to leave the conversation or make someone hate me. 


I'm also worried about how people will react to my writing... since all the characters in the society in my story are genderless, they're all pansexual. They don't have a concept of being exclusively interested in men or women, because they don't have a concept of *being* a man or a woman. I feel like people would be angry at me for saying that main couple, who are both physically male, aren't exclusively into men. I'm not ""representing"" gay people, but I'm not ""representing"" straight people either. And I'm not ""representing"" real-life pansexual people, either, they'd say, because it's not about them being a minority. I'm not ""representing"" *any* real-life gender or sexuality box, I'm representing what people could be without the boxes. I'm also not ""representing"" any real-life race - the characters have many different skin tones and features, and their culture isn't based on any one real place. I feel like a lot of people think this is wrong, or backwards, somehow. I'm also afraid that when I draw any physically female characters, if I draw them sexually, people would be offended and say it's sexist, even though I draw the physically male characters the same way. But if all the male characters are practically naked, and all the female characters are covered up just to avoid accusations, that's the exact kind of sexism I'm trying to avoid. ... I would love to make a character, draw them sexually, and not give them a physical sex. Like, if you think their butt is hot, but only if you know what's on the other side, then... sucks for you. 


Other than with my work, I'm not sure what I'm afraid of, exactly. Most of the people that I've met, I haven't wanted to be friends with anyway, because they were just really unpleasant in a lot of ways (mostly... school teachers who bully their students, and things on that level. I don't want to get into it, but like. *unpleasant*.) But I'm just worried that someone will have a problem with me over this and... what? Attack me? Publicly shame me on the internet? Tell someone not to listen to me or trust me, because I'm sexist, and the person they say that to will hate me before they even meet me? 


I don't know... I guess that's the nature of anxiety?

Anyway, thoughts? I guess I'm also sort of doing this as a litmus test to see if people really would... what? hate me? fight me? I don't know..."

nd,"I went through my spreadsheet/inventory and, in a new column, roughly calculated how many months I've had a product in my collection. I already write down when I get something (and I try to make a note if I keep it as a backup and open it much later after acquiring it.) Putting this in terms of months has helped me see just how long some of these products are taking me to use up and how silly it might be for me to buy another kind of the same product as a backup or as a variation. Looking at the date is too abstract sometimes, for me.


It also shows me how my perception of time is relevant. I feel like I use powders up quickly-- But it looks like I'm getting about 8 solid months out of using a pressed powder. Since other products I have take so much longer to pan, I often feel anxious about rebuying something like powder...when in reality, it takes more time than I think. Also, I have a translucent loose powder, so it's not like I'll be down to zero if I run out of one. I almost bought a powder before the VIB sale (before!!) because I was sure I was going to run out. Now I see that was just my anxiety in the driver's seat and having this as a future reference will help me ease the push to get backups. 


**Some notes about my usage**


* Brow Wiz - 19 months, I use it with another pencil (Definer or Perfect Brow) almost daily. In all fairness, I didn't jot down when I started using this and I believe this was bought as a backup. I have another one of these in waiting. I'm going to slow my role in buying these as backups because the one in my collection from December 2017. 


* Brow Definer - 17 months and I started using it right away. Will not buy again. 


* Perfect Brow - 26 months, this product is very underrated. Would be willing to only buy this and give up on Brow Wiz in the future. 


* Shadow Primer FS - 8 months and I'm 2/3 of the way through. I put it in my eyebrows and in my undereye area also. I use it nearly daily.


* Pressed Powder, tinted - 7 months and I probably have about a month or two left.


* It Cosmetics CC Cream - 11 months, I would like to finish this by July if possible but I go in phases with it. 


* Nars (chubby) Lip Pencils - If it's a color I like a lot, I can pan it easily in less than 12 months. I had two colors I was mixing together frequently and I was done with the one I sometimes wore alone within a year. 


* My oldest products are some eyeshadows that are 28 months old. 


If you use months as a tool, tell me some surprising things you've found out about yourself or your collection.

I was recently debugging a performance issue with RenderPresent on Mac \(turns out VSYNC fixes the issue\).

The problem: SDL\_RenderPresent takes 40ms\+ every so often, which creates noticeable lagging.

The solution: Turning on Vsync via SDL\_HINT\_RENDER\_VSYNC.

Context: Not a very intense amount of objects, no locking texture business, just plain textures with one call to SDL\_RenderPresent. My observations were that every second or so, an SDL\_RenderPresent would take roughly 40 ms, which yields less than 30fps \(which looks horrible\). The average framerate would still exceed \~200 if unlocked.

My question: Is this a known Mac\-ism, or something along those lines? Any thoughts on this problem?"

nd,"Welcome back to the Let Thrones Beware design blog. This week, we're taking a look at how the universal challenge mechanic uses a few different systems as modifiers. Last week's blog answered a number of community questions about how the mechanic works. If you haven't read it, [you can find that here](http://www.letthronesbeware.com/2018/04/30/core-mechanic-the-challenge-community-questions/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=betablog&amp;utm_medium=selfpost).


**Dice Modifiers**

One thing that I really wanted to be sure of in designing Let Thrones Beware was that there were as few fiddly modifiers as possible. Too many games of my youth had a billion different pluses and minuses to track. To make matters worse, designers would purposefully limit the compatibility of  bonuses in an attempt to make sure that characters wouldn't be too powerful.
 
Recently, there's been a lot of great innovation in this space. Some designers have adopted dice pools, giving us games like Burning Wheel, Legend of the Five Rings, and Blades in the Dark. Others have attempted to simplify the number of modifiers, giving us 13th Age and D&amp;D 5th Edition. Still others have introduced novel new mechanics, like Shadow of the Demon Lord's great bane/boon system.


***Desperation***

Desperation is the first modifier mechanic we meet today. It's active in every challenge the heroes undertake. Beginning at Composed (+1), Desperation climbs each round until it reaches Frantic (+4). Modelling how frenetic the challenge becomes, the role of this mechanic is several-fold.
 
First, Desperation interacts with Edge to provide the heroes with a source of enhancements to their rolls. Whenever a hero gains an Edge, they add the Desperation value to their Force Score. Conversely, when they lose an Edge, they subtract it. This is
 
Second, Desperation gives adversaries their combat AI. Each adversary type (Minion, Standard, and Commander), and category (Bandit, Militia, Condemned, etc) have behaviours which are triggered at certain Desperation levels. A group of militia foot will start combat in closely-ordered formations, but will break apart as Desperation grows, for example. These behaviours are just recommendations, but using them will provide each different adversary with a distinct personality.
 
Third, Desperation modifies the powers used by enemy adversaries. As the stakes grow higher and the heroes persist through combat, enemies will begin to use more and more powerful attacks. A brigand knife may open a fight firing arrows at a single target, but by the time Desperation reaches Panicked (+3) and shes' grown worried about the battle, she'll switch to using alchemical grenades that ignite entire areas.
 

***Edge***

The second modifier is Edge, which is gained when a hero has a temporary situational bonus (or penalty). It can be secured from a great many things. Examples include cooperating with an ally to flank an opponent in combat (yes, this means that positioning in combat is important), having appropriate repertoire for a non-combat challenge. Additionally, a number of  powers possessed by different classes and backgrounds provide Edge when used. Unlike heroes, adversaries have a predetermined, set value for Edge when they gain it. In exchange, as the number of rounds in a challenge climb, enemies begin to hit harder and harder.
 
As mentioned above, Edge keys of the Desperation value, which means that it's less valuable at the beginning of an encounter than it is at the end. This is important for a couple reasons - first, while cooperation is always important, it becomes even moreso towards the end of an encounter. Second, the escalation of values means that fights reliably end in the third or fourth combat round. This helps ensure that a battle doesn't take hours and hours to resolve.


***Advantage***

The last modifier is Advantage (and Disadvantage). Relatively harder to come by, Advantage directly affects your dice. Always applied in the next round (i.e. a hero never gains Advantage in the current round), this mechanic boosts your Tier Dice. A hero with Advantage rolls 2d8 rather than 2d6, while a Legend with Advantage will roll a weighty 2d12. Certain terrifying situations could result in Disadvantage, which decreases your dice in the same way. Yes, that means that an unlucky hero could be forced to roll 2d4!
 
In designing Advantage, I wanted to achieve a system that felt meaningful and allowed heroes to punch above their weight. The act of swapping out dice provides a concrete heft, and a hero who is rolling above his or her tier in a challenge becomes a real force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.
 

**Next Week**

That's it for the dice modifiers of Let Thrones Beware! As you can see, there's not a lot of complicated fiddly bits to keep track of here. The design goal of ""no million +1s"" is neatly achieved. Next week, we'll continue our examination of the challenge mechanic by taking a look at how it's used in combat.

nd,People the run a lot.
nd,I just got certified in LSVT last weekend and have yet to implement it fully. I work in a SNF and am noticing some barriers and hurdles I need to cross to follow the protocol fully. I was wondering if anyone else in the SNFs or any other setting use it and what you love and/or hate about LSVT.  It’s such an intensive program that it seems to difficult to implement in any setting other than outpatient or private practice.

nd,"the general feeling i get from this sub is people who are new to lifting will start a program with a 1rm bench of 100lbs then 6 months later have a 1rm of like 160. Either im misinterpreting that their starting weight isnt actually their 1rm and is instead just the 60-70% starting weight a lot of programs recommend starting at, or im missing something big when it comes to gaining.

I forget the name of the program Im on but i think its a 5x5 SL variant and got it from this sub but one of the rules is when you fail a lift at a certain weight twice, you reduce it by 10-15% and then start back up. Ive done this twice now (its been about 3 weeks since the first time i failed on it) and i still cant get past 65lbs on my barbell curls, i just keep failing on it, moving down 10lbs then back up in 5lbs increments until i fail at 65lbs again. All my lifts are like this except lifts that i had never tried before and started really light on. Still yet to hit my limit on those.

Ive been lifting 3 days a week regularly for almost 5 months and was going to the gym regularly without a real program for another 5 months before that.

Ive gone from 140lbs -&gt; 152lbs since February (4 months). I Go 3 days a week for a bout 1hr and 30min including light stretching and warmups. my current program with current weight is:

.

Day A)

Bench Press 5x5 @ 115

squat 5x5 @ 100 (was @ 140 but currently tying to fix my form. not very flexible and i keep falling back if i dont arch my back forward or lift my heels up)

rows 5x5 @ 85 (42.5lbs for each hand on the row machine)

barbell shrugs 3x8 @ 90

skull crushers 3x8 @ 45

barbell curls 3x8 @ 65 (DNF on last set)

hyperextension 2x10

abs: 3x10 @ 67.5

.

Day B)

Squat

Deadlift 1x5 @ 150 (use trap bar)

Overhead Press 5x5 @ 80

Rows

Close Grip Bench Press 3x8 @ 90

Barbell Curls

Abs"
nd,"I recently fell in love with turtleneck sweaters after a trip to Paris, unfortunately I haven't worn one since I was twelve years old! The girls in Paris usually wore them alone or paired with leather jackets \(for spring weather\), but what caught my attention the most is how effortless it all looked. The way they wore the turtleneck high \(usually unfolded or with some hair tucked in\) with the hair tied and thrown over tight jeans or lighter pants had such an elegant yet somehow messy effect. Yesterday I bought 2 turtlenecks \(including an oversize one\), I wanted to know how you girls usually wear them especially during cold\-ish spring days. Also, do you usually wear the neck unfolded or folded, as I like to pull my head out of the neck and let it sit high without folding it \(I find it highlights my face more\) Also, am I the only one who can't stop ""playing"" with the neck???? Like every time i'm bored or stressed I can't stop pulling it over my face over and over again, sometimes people are talking to me and I just burry my face in my turtleneck without even realizing it!

I broke down in the HR office and made an appointment the next day at the clinic. I feel ... better. I think. Scared more than anything but I know with help i may stop feeling empty inside 24/7.

nd,"What are your subjective differences between the 2nd/3rd generation antihistamines like Allegra (fexofenadine), Zyrtec/Reactine (cetirizine), Claritin (loratadine) and Clarinex/Aerius (lesloratadine)?

For me, Allegra is good for treating allergies with zero side effects but when things get bad I need to take 360 mg in the morning and 180 mg at night (3x the recommended dose but it's safe according to studies, plus that's also the direction prescribed by allergists). Reactine (Zyrtec in the US) on the other hand also works but makes me drowsy as shit and gives me general fatigue/malaise/depression. I haven't tried (des)loratadine yet but I'd like to try those two to gauge its effectiveness and side effects. I've read that they can be good to treat acne too.

Finally, a question for Flonase or other nasal steroid spray users: do you need an antihistamine on top of it for total symptom remission? Same goes for spirulina users, is that enough on its own? Currently I'm using 360 - 540 mg Allegra daily + 2 sprays of Flonase but I just started the latter so it'll take a couple weeks to work. I also use 3 grams of spirulina daily (Nutrex Hawaii) brand which is [the single best supplement to help allergies (though I'm not sure if that's enough on its own rather than an adjuvant)](https://examine.com/supplements/spirulina/#summary7-4)."

It sounds gruesome but it’s my reality. Now that I’m pregnant, I can’t even imagine what birth will feel like. I tried this morning to get a dildo in and could barely fit the tip.

nd,"I am currently interviewing at a janitorial supply company to be an outside sales rep. I was hoping somebody in HR could provide me some insight on a few areas.

After 3 interviews they have asked me to fill out a form that is very very detailed which for the most part are appropriate questions, though a few are raising some red flags for me.

1) they ask for my High School class ranking and size. Which I first have all have no relocation of, second of all I have a masters degree and find that information irrelevant a decade later.

2) they ask how my college was paid for. I'm not sure if that is even a legal question and it is none of there business or relevant in any way shape or form.

3) instead of them calling references supplied by me they want me to schedule them phone calls with all previous supervisors I have had for the last 10 years and ask detailed questions as opposed to an employment verification. Is this common practice I have never heard of a company that does this and calls to previous employers is usually done in the post offer background check phase.

This seems a little intense for a low level sales job selling toilet paper and Windex, it's not the FBI or anything. I have had jobs at bigger firms before and none of this information has ever been asked of me. 

The best part is I still have at least two more interviews before I would expect an offer.

nd,"Okay, so, this might not be the most eloquent or put together but I just found this all out today and I'm pretty frazzled about it. I'm writing this because my boyfriend thought it would be a good idea to get some advice on the situation.  

Backstory: My parents got separated a little over a year ago and for the last couple months my mom has been emailing this guy back and forth and they're in like a semi-serious relationship. A month or two ago, she found out he had lied about who he was/his name/where he lived/literally everything about him and I thought they broke it off, but they recently started chatting again. Now, when my mom first began this relationship, I told her that under no circumstances should she ever send money to people that she hadn't met, and even if they had met, it's not a good idea. You can probably see where this is going. Turns out, this dude lives in Nigeria (HUGE RED FLAG, RIGHT?) and she's been sending him money regularly over the last month and a half. Like, to the tune of over 1000$. And that's just what I'm aware of. It could be more. 

I confronted her about this and told her that she shouldn't be sending him money, that she had no proof that he is who he says he is, considering the name he uses on Western Union isn't his 'real name' (that's probably a fake name too). She told me that she sends him money for food, despite having no proof of this, made me promise not to tell anyone else, like my brother or my grandma, the latter of which is VERY critical of her relationship with him for obvious reasons, and that it was her money and she could do what she wanted with it. Also something about knowing what she was doing/not going overboard/whatever. It's kind of all a blur, and I think I'm in shock that for someone who mocked other people for being stupid enough to fall for phone scams, she's fallen for this one. Like, my mom isn't stupid. She's well educated, she works for insurance companies, and is on a computer for her entire workday. 

Like, TL;DR, What can I do about this? Can I report his email or something to Western Union to notify them of the scam and hopefully make it impossible for her to send money to him? My mom doesn't password protect her laptop or log out of her email so it would be fairly easy (I think) for me to find the relevant Western Union information or his account details. I'm at a loss.

I know the generic uses of the parts within a pc but not what makes them better than other parts. This rig will be used for gaming and work, ***mainly gaming***. In games, I'm looking to be able to run modern games comfortably at stable 60 or higher fps on high settings. My budget for the build is around $2000 CAD, but I can go a bit higher or lower as long as I am future-proof since I'm planning to use it for long-term and upgrading it along the way *if needed*. All of the parts will be purchased in Canada. Do you think I should change anything? Thanks c:

EDIT 1: Grammar"
nd,"I have written for many papers and magazines in the last decade, and I have wanted to write atheist pieces for some time. I've been in the business for a long time and atheist articles do not get accepted with any consistency. I'm curious if there are any publications in Ohio that have any tendency to publish atheist pieces."
nd,"Noob btw. And also what is a ""Super Cucumber""?

nd,"I just got my second lobe piercings done about a month and a half ago and theyve been healing normally but i just noticed a painful bump forming over the back of my left piercing (i still have my starter earrings in which are tiny round gold studs) .. at first i thought the skin had grown over but after looking in the mirror it looks more like a hypertrophic scar. I’ve just stopped cleaning them since it has been 6 weeks but have no clue what i should start cleaning this bump with?? Its pretty painful, i just did a salt soak and put a tiny bit of peroxide on it with q-tip (apparently thats bad) but im desperate!!!"
nd,"I've been hearing static from any headphone that I use, from any of the ports (frontal or back USBs, or headphone jacks). Drivers are updated. PC is not too dusty, even though I haven't cleaned it in a while. Lowering sound levels in the lower right of the windows task bar lowers ou eleminates (at very low levels) the buzz sound. I keep it far away from most electrical sources (there are not outlets nearby and the PSU is kept far away). I don't believe I have a sound card. Motherboard is a h81m-C/BR .

I've only noticed it when I changed audio settings in Portal 2 from stereo to headphone, even though that makes no sense."
nd,"Hey, I made my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/8dtd62/im_a_transfer_student_to_a_new_university_im_fine/) in this sub 9 days ago apparently, and I thought I'd give an update as to how things are going now. I might do this semi-regularly, since I find having some accountability helpful.

So over those 9 days, I

* made an effort to make more small talk with my classmates. None of them seem like they especially care for me yet, but I'm starting to get an idea of what they're generally like.
* went to my first dance class. I was pretty nervous, and it definitely showed, but I really enjoyed it. I'm really scared, but I'm going to try to go again this week.
* hung out with a friend from fall quarter over the weekend - maybe the only real friend I've got here. That was pretty neat, even though we mostly just talked about work and politics and the like.

I get the feeling that I'm at the start of a very long, and very painful, journey. I also get the vibe that I'm going to have many parts of myself challenged to change while I go through it.

On the one hand, change is hard. On the other, if I stay just the same as I am now, personality and habits and everything, I'll probably backslide into loneliness.

I'll take the middle ground, and not force any changes to happen - but if I notice any happening anyway, I won't fight it. Change is always difficult, but these ones will hopefully be rewarding."
nd,"does anyone else tend to get a bit depressed over the summer? Over the school year I become so used to having work to fill my time and I get to see my friends everyday. During the summer I have much less work, so when I try to accomplish simple tasks that have to do with my own interests I get distracted by thoughts that tell me what I’m doing doesn’t matter and that I’m wasting my time. This typically ends in me becoming completely unproductive and spiraling into these hopeless thoughts. Can anyone relate and does anyone have tips for beating these kinds of thought so I can actually enjoy my free time? So far I have found that making a schedule of my day tends to make me feel more accomplished and less worthless, but any other advice would be appreciated!!"
nd,"So tell me, what have you tried? What's the best bang for buck? Which ones come in the best colours for your skin tone? Which ones have the most natural beautiful finish?

nd,"Title says it all basically. In the convoluted history of psychiatric diagnoses, was there any major reference to this dynamic, was it ever considered a feature of other conditions, or was Asperger literally the first dude to identify it and associate it w developmental problems?"
nd,"Okay, so I recently bought the dlc (it's phenomenal by the way), and I completed Simon's quest line and just acquired his bowblade and the underground cell key. When I went down to try and unlock the doors after the corpse pile, this hunter appeared. Well I obliterated him and now all of the doors still say locked. Am I missing something? Many thanks in advance.

Edit: Opened the door and killed Brador but the rest of the doors are still locked."

If you would like to play together, maybe some Iron Banner this weekend...Send me a message on PS4 at Dossett_Pants"
nd,"I know how to use mindfulness of breathing to generate a sense of pleasure, happiness, and comfort for myself, but sometimes I feel guilty about doing this practice.  For example, when walking in a city I see so many beings who are suffering so much with addiction, mental illness, poverty, hunger, etc.  In addition, some of my close friends are deeply suffering from mental illness and depression, and when I'm around them I can concentrate on my breathing to make myself feel good, but they are still feeling miserable.  I've tried listening to them and trying to offer advice, but overall I've been very ineffective it seems. How can I use my mindfulness practice to better help my friends or even strangers who are suffering so much?

&amp;nbsp; 

I know how to use my breath to make myself feel good, but what about everyone else?  How can I extend the benefits of my mindfulness practice towards other beings?  Sometimes I feel selfish/guilty using mindfulness to make myself feel good while so many other people seem so dang miserable.  Any advice?"
nd,"I'm not asking for advice about how to approach her or convince her to get help, nor am I seeking advice on whether or not to do it(we're doing this either way, we've already started) but I wondered what the consequences are going to be for her.

Out goal is simply to clear out most of her hoard and deal with things related to that... but people keep warning me that this is going to lead to devastating effects on her mental state."
nd,People really getting disturbed by Bud Stankz swag in the new video. It just got release today.
nd,"I mainly talking about books likes Conan the barbarian, Tarzan of the apes or John carter of mars. They often feature very feat and muscular men potraying unimaginable feats, a lot of violence and sometimes sex and females who( despite well written) are often the damsels in skimpy outfits. With how books are often written these days, are power fantasies still liked or are they seen as things of the past. I still enjoy them fin time to time but I want your opinions."

The stress of unexpected repairs is a major downside. 

I know nothing about leasing cars. So I am wondering if I can find a cheap lease on a car where the dealership is on the hook for paying for oil changes, tires, engine flushes and stuff like that.

Basically, how much of the cost of car ownership can be passed on to someone  else?

nd,"TL;DR \- Christophe Robin's Cleansing Purifying Scrub with Sea Salt is awesome my scalp skin feels ridiculously good 5/5

A bit unorthodox, but my skin care journey was contained to my face and neck for so long and expanding it past my décolletage has benefited me greatly. But thanks to a recent Gothamista video \(she's wonderful, seriously I highly suggest you give her a watch if you haven't already\) I decided to do something for an oft neglected part of my skin, namely my scalp.

I use shampoo \(an SLS\-free one at that!\) and walk the line between washing my hair often enough... but not TOO often, so what more is there to do? Apparently, a lot.

My hair had been looking just blah lately. Dull, lifeless, and stuck to my head no matter how much I round\-brushed and volume\-sprayed. So I turned to the fateful video\- Gothamista's hair and scalp care recommendations \([Watch it yourself here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apiq4cx_L2Y)\). I had truthfully never thought of scalp care. I don't have dandruff, so it's a non\-issue to me. I had noticed some build\-up on my scalp however and the Christophe Robin Cleansing Purifying Scrub with Sea Salt \([This One](https://www.sephora.com/product/cleansing-purifying-scrub-with-sea-salt-P401452?SKUID=1747393&amp;om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716902_56760219327_aud-423582954366:pla-443106181914_1747393_257731958771_9029600_c&amp;country_switch=us&amp;lang=en&amp;gclid=CMmQqoTThtsCFQGlZQodNCwI4g&amp;gclsrc=ds)\) intrigued me. 

I'll admit I had a bit of sticker shock when I saw the price tag inside the Sephora, but I was committed to the idea and decided if I used this big tub once per week it would last a while. It was worth it. Oh so worth it.

First off, putting it on is just luxurious. It is dense and has the texture indicative of the sea salt granules it promises, yet has an easily spreadable quality and found I had not trouble getting it through my tangles to my scalp.

No joke, even typing this gives me chills, but the feeling of massaging this onto your scalp it incredible. You know how good it feels when the hairdresser gives you a scalp massage? It was that good. As I started rubbing it more I realized, my scalp was \*\*\*itchy\*\*\*! It felt like I was scrubbing away so much build\-up and my scalp was finally breathing. It is emollient and therefore when you add water to it \(once you're done with your 10 minute massage\) it starts to dissolve and washes out fairly easily. It left my hair feeling slightly coarse, but once I conditioned like normal that feeling went away.

The difference this has made in my hair is the kind of results I see in the hyper un\-realistic ads for haircare products you see on tv. My hair has so much more volume and it's so much lighter, but although my hair looks gorgeous I want to focus more on what it means for this sub, namely the skincare side of the equation and how my scalp feels. Have you ever had, say, a hair stuck to your face and you move it and go ""Wow I didn't realize that was there, but it was so uncomfortable I feel so much better now!"" Honestly as I sit here my scalp feels.... alive, like it's finally able to breath. It has a tingling feeling like it's just clean and refreshed. We are so concerned with cleansing our faces, but I've never realized how many hair care products I put on my scalp that shampoo alone can't eat through.

I would highly recommend everyone giving this scrub a try, or at least some variation of it. Side\-note: I also think this would benefit anyone who gets acne around their hairline. It never hurts to extend our love of skincare to other parts of your body, and while I hadn't given my scalp a thought in the past, I'm so happy I did!"
nd,"I'm not happy at my current job and I'm not sure what I should do and I was hoping for some advice.  If you have ever been in a similiar situation or have seen similiar things, I would like the feedback.

Late summer/early fall 2017 I was becoming unhappy at my current job and was starting to look into leaving.  As this was happening, a year long rotation in my department came available and someone kept pushing me to do it.  It would allow me to move to a major city from a more rural area and experience something new.  I looked into it and decided maybe I needed a change of scenery and I decided to do it.  About 6 months into the rotation now, I'm not sure it was the right choice.  I still work with most of the same people, doing the same job, just at a different location.  I'm still unhappy and I'm not sure if I should look into leaving.  There are a couple of reasons why.

1. The Pay - The pay is really good.  Because I live in a major city where the cost of living is high, I get a huge living stipend.  To put it simply, my salary almost doubled and I'm putting thousands a month into the bank.....but money isnt everything.

2. Will leaving make me look bad? - When I took this rotation, I took it for just under a year.  If I do leave, I'm worried it might make me look bad.  Now I have two thoughts to this.  One is I would tell any other job I got I need time for my department to get someone else into my current role.  The other is why do I have any loyalty to this company I dont even want to work for.

What do you think.  The money is great, and would I be making a mistake giving that all up.  The main worry though is does it look like I'm bailing on this rotation and putting my department in a tough spot.  I'd love to know what you all think?"
nd,"Is there a place where I can have all the vendors, crafting stations and the 3 mill parse dummy? I can't add all of these into the Daggerfall Overlook atm."
nd,I was recently given a PC and decided If I could game on it (new PCMR member) and so are there any good graphics card for that price?
nd,"Due to overwhelming support for the idea, I decided to make a little “Intro to Alcohol” for new exmos. 

First off: 

Don’t drink to rebel, drink because you want to.

Don't drink if you don't want to. Lots of people don't and that's perfectly ok.

It may take a while to figure out what you like to drink and how much you can drink. I usually will have 2 drinks if I want a chill buzz. 4 drinks makes me somewhat drunk and I don't go past that. If you take the time to pay attention to how much you're drinking (by measuring the alcohol in mixed drinks, etc.) you can get a feel for how it affects your body. 

Be safe, be smart. 

--------


***Warnings*** 

You have to read these before you read the rest.

**Don’t drink and drive.** Don’t. If you’ve had a drink, don’t drive. Plan ahead - have a designated driver, call an Uber, stay the night. But don’t drink and drive. Period.

**Don’t mix medicine.** Tylenol (acetaminophen, which is also in Excedrin) and alcohol are a bad combo. When you combine them, you get liver failure, kidney failure, or internal bleeding. Not fun! So don’t. 

**Don’t give a fuck what other people think.** Drink what you want because you want to. When I started drinking I usually ordered sweet “girlie” drinks. But they’re fucking delicious. I drink what I want. You should too.

**Do hydrate.** If you drink a glass of water for every drink you have, your body will thank you in the morning. Now that I’m over 30, I’ll drink water while I’m drinking, and then drink 2 water bottles before bed. Yeah you pee a lot, but you want to die the next morning. Worth it.

**Do eat.** In the same vein as water. If you drink on an empty stomach, alcohol will hit you a lot harder. Just eat something.

**Do be aware of calories.** Realize that you’re ingesting a lot of liquid calories. It’s easy to drink 1000 calories in a sitting. That adds up, fatty. Just be aware and take it into account with your dietary goals (if any).

**Don’t drink alone.** Drinking with friends is fun. Drinking alone because you’re depressed is called alcoholism. Be aware of how you’re feeling and what you’re doing. Talk to someone if you feel like drinking all the time. PM me if you want, just talk to someone and take care of yourself.

_____

***Basic Info***
1 “drink” = 1 beer, 1 8oz glass of wine, 1 shot of liquor. Use this to keep track of how much you’ve had to drink. The general rule is for men: 2 drinks and then 1 drink per hour after that, women: 1 drink per hour. Your body may be different.

Proof = the proof number is double the ABV. So, whiskey that is 80 proof is 40%ABV. 120 proof is 60%ABV. Now you know.

On the rocks = on ice

Well drinks = at a bar, these are usually lower-quality, but also cheap. Usually a cheaper alcohol with a simple mixer.

_____

***Types of Alcohol:***

**Sodas:** 
If you want to drink something that’s sweet and doesn’t taste like alcohol, this is a great place to start, go with Mike’s Hard Lemonade or Smirnoff Ice (lots of different flavors for both). People may make fun of you, but you used to be Mormon, so you’re used to it. There’s also “hard soda” like root beer, orange, ginger ale, etc. I haven’t tried any except root beer, and Not Your Father’s Root Beer was my favorite of those. 

**Beer:** 
Beer is brewed from barley, and has hops for flavor. Generally ranges 4-7% ABV (alcohol by volume). Unless you’re in Utah, then you get 3.2%ABV at the grocery store which you shouldn’t even bother with. Go out or go to the liquor store.
	
Beer is great because there a TONS of options, and I’m not even going to try to cover everything. Best thing to do is just try different things and see what you like. Many restaurants will have a beer sampler where you can order 4-6 small glasses of beer and try different flavors. Go explore!

*Where to start:*

I like Blue Moon - it is a wheat beer and has a slight orange flavor, and isn’t too bitter. There’s also a Blue Mood Apricot and Mango - both more sweet than the standard Blue Moon. If there’s no Blue Moon, Shock Top is very similar.
For a standard “beer beer” - try Stella Artois. 

If you light coffee/chocolate flavors, try a stout beer. They’re darker and are often brewed with coffee.

If you want something light - try Bud/Miller/Coors Light. There’s not a ton of flavor, but they’re not bad, have like half the calories of regular beer, and don’t weigh you down as much. Great for beer pong! I’m partial to Bud Light and Michelob Ultra for when I want something lighter.

I also like Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy - it’s beer with a lemonade flavor. Great for summer.

Lots of people like IPAs, which have more hops and can be more bitter. There’s a million options here - go to a local brewery to sample or ask your server/bartender for suggestions.



**Wine:**

Wine is made from grapes and generally has between 10-15% ABV. There are a million options here as well, but Red, White, and Rosé are the three main categories. There is also champagne, which is basically carbonated wine. You’ll also see “sparkling wine” at the store, which is the same thing. The wine has to be from a certain region in France to be called champagne, otherwise it’s just “sparkling.” 

*Where to start:* 

Rosé - this is a pink wine, tastes fruity and is sweet. One of the easiest (read: tasty) ways to start drinking wine. My wife loves the brand Barefoot wine and it’s pretty ubiquitous. If you can find any wine tastings where you live, they’re a great place to start and sample lots of different wines. Make a note of which ones you like.

Or for sparkline wine try a Prosecco, I like the “La Marca” brand. 

*Pro tip* - buy a corkscrew. Like [this](https://i.imgur.com/MIuNSVe.jpg) one! To use, put on top of the cork, turn the top to screw the corkscrew. As you do it, the handles will move up. Then, pull down on both handles and the cork will pop out.They’re like $5 and you won’t have to try to dig out a cork with a knife or screwdriver because you forgot to buy one and you’re trying to impress your wife.


**Vodka**

Vodka is generally made from grains or potatoes. It will almost always be 40%ABV. Generally it’s used in cocktails and mixed drinks, not drunk by itself. Also, when you’re looking at buying vodka, the term “top shelf” is somewhat accurate - higher quality will be higher up on the shelf. Don’t buy the cheap stuff on the bottom shelf. Good choices are New Amsterdam, Deep Eddy, Absolut, Svedka, and Smirnoff. Most brands now offer flavored vodka as well which are fun to use in mixed drinks to add more flavor. Drink recipes are at the end.

*Common drinks:* Martini, vodka cranberry, Moscow Mule, Screwdriver

**Whiskey**

Whiskey is generally made from grains and is fermented and aged in barrels and usually is 40-50%ABV. Jack Daniels is probably the one you’ve heard of. There are lots of sub and side categories to whiskey, including bourbon, rye whiskey, and scotch. I wouldn’t recommend starting off with whiskey as it is strong and you usually drink it straight. Lots of good flavor, lots of strong alcohol taste and you probably won’t like it right off the bat.

*Common ways to drink:* On the rocks, or mixed with Coke or Ginger Ale. One of my favorite drinks is a jack and ginger ale. To make: 1-2 shots whiskey (Jack Daniels) in a glass, add ginger ale, add ice. Enjoy. It’s strong but the ginger ale masks some of the alcohol flavor so you can taste the whiskey.

**Rum**

Why’s the rum gone? Because I made mojitos for everyone. Rum is usually made from sugar cane or molasses and has between 20% and 40%ABV. The most common are Malibu and Bacardi. Malibu has a coconut flavor and Bacardi either comes in white (clear) or lots of different flavors that are good for mixing. I don’t drink rum straight, I use it just for cocktails and mixed drinks and both of these are good for that.

*Common drinks*: Daquiri, mai tai, Coke and Rum, mojito

**Tequila**

From south of the border, made from agave. Usually has 40%ABV. I don’t drink it much but it’s what is in margaritas. Common brands are Patron and Jose Cuervo.

*Common drinks:* margaritas. Order one next time you’re out, most places have several flavors and they’re tasty. Try a frozen margarita too! 

------

***Recipes***

How to win friends and intoxicate people. This is the fun part. Here are a few of my go-to drinks when I want to make something. Go buy a shot glass so you can keep track of how much you are using in your drinks. Also, for the ones that call for 1 shot, you can up it to 2 if you want it stronger.

**Vodka:**

*Vodka Cranberry:* 1 shot vodka, ice, and fill glass with cranberry juice.

*Vodka whatever:* 1 shot vodka, ice, and fill glass with fruity soda. Most grocery stores carry [Sparkling Ice](https://i.imgur.com/bncSjQo.jpg) and it makes a great mixer. Add fresh/frozen fruit to make it fancier.

*Screwdriver:* 1 shot vodka, ice, fill glass with orange juice

**Whiskey:**

Jack and Ginger: 1 shot whiskey, ice, fill glass with ginger ale. (my personal favorite)
Jack and Coke: Same, but with Coke. Don’t use Pepsi. You’re a heathen but not a degenerate.

**Rum:**

*Mojito:* 


1-2 shots [White Rum](https://i.imgur.com/d5XCNj2.jpg) in a glass. 

Add 5-6 mint leaves torn in half. Mix the mint leaves and smash them a bit (use a spoon or straw or something). 

Then add a shot of [sweetened lime juice](https://i.imgur.com/y3I83gv.jpg). 

Then add fruit. I do 5-8 raspberries (fresh or frozen), or 4-6 blackberries and 3-4 peach slices (fresh or frozen).

Mix around a bit and smash a berry or two.

Add several ice cubes.

Fill cup with club soda.

Note: Make this and people will be your friend. I usually use frozen fruit and keep all liquids in the fridge so it’s nice and cool, great for summer.

*Coke and Rum:* 1-2 shots [Malibu](https://i.imgur.com/uVoWrQ7.jpg), add ice, and fill with Coke.

*Strawberry Daiquiri:* [Strawberry daquiri mix](https://i.imgur.com/y2YSMCn.png) (Tres Agaves is my favorite). Follow the instructions on the bottle, but basically 1-2 shots of rum, 4 shots of mix, 1 shot sweetened lime juice, bunch of ice, and blend in a blender. Add more mix to taste.


**Tequila:**

*Margarita:* Margarita mix, 1-2 shots Tequila. Add ice and blend if you want a frozen one.

**Other**

This is a favorite at my house for when people come over, but it's a little more involved. Tastes like pink lemonade:

*Pink Cadillac* (from BJ's Restaurant)

nd,"We all know that history is not pretty and depending on what kind of history you study you are likely to come across certain words that are highly offensive in today's world. I was just wondering how historians who write academic papers or give lectures on their research handle the use of slurs in the medium they are presenting their data. 

I am asking this because I've met some fellow history students, when I was an undergraduate, who felt that because of how offensive the word is it should not be used, even sparingly, when discussing a historical topic. For example, in a course history of lgbt activism in the united states there was an individual in my class that did not like my use of the word dyke, even though the activists herself used the word to describe herself, because of the animus often attached to the word. Of course the most obvious example would be a discussion of jim crow and saying n-word instead of the actual slur.

I personally think that we shouldn't try to hide the ugliness of the past and that if used in the historical context, and not just to create shock value, it is acceptable to use such words. I'll add that it's also obviously easier to use the words in a paper vs speaking them before others.

I do apologize if the question is too broad, but I just was curious what the historians here think."

y = 3x \-4 and \-x \+ 2y = 12

I rearrange the first equation to make sure the terms are in the correct order for elimination

that gives me \-3x \+ y = \-4 which is fine, however the next steps confuse me, my course states

""next multiply the result by 2 so that the y\-terms will cancel when we subtract the equations""

this is done by 2\(\-3x \+ y\) = 2\(\-4\) to produce \-6x \+ 2y = \- 8

The next step shows subtracting the equations, how do I know that I will need to subtract the equations, instead of adding them? I haven't seen any indication on the reasoning for subtracting in this case instead of a previous case of adding \(where the equation resulted in \(3x \+ 4y = 12         \+         \-3x \+ 2y = 18\)

Is the reason I'm subtracting simply because both the equations at the top have a \-1 coefficient on the x value? To get the result of adding the equations I must use subtraction to make use of \(\-x \+ \-x = x\)?

I'm 27 and recently started living in Seattle. It was sort of a sudden move but a very good one. I work as a hardware engineer/project manager (exciting times). I also volunteer for an animal shelter and mental health advocacy group.

Not going to lie, I have way too many interests. Some of those include, but aren't limited to:
Puns, food, tea, scarves, exploring, art, travel, hiking, kayaking, Netflix series, animals/pets (please send as many pics of your pets as you'd like!), and deep philosophical discussions about life, the world, and ice cream.

I travelled to the UK for the first time last month and loved every moment of it. I was mostly in London and loved wandering around. I'm planning to travel quite a bit more and would love to make friends in places around the world. I'm mostly looking for people in the UK and Canada, as those are places I'm going to be travelling to quite a bit. However, I'm open to anyone around my age!

I have no idea what to think or say. I got my blood work results back Feb 1st and everything was fine other than ""B"" type symptoms and a couple lumps on my neck, accompanied with back pain and a now resolved nausea and vomiting issue. 

After I went back to my general doctor, when he said to wait a month and see if it gets worse on my neck, the biopsy he ordered on my neck came back as positive for Hodgkins Lymphoma. A PET scan was ordered and I was just told by my hematologist/oncologist that I am stage 4. It's in my neck on both sides now, also on my liver, in one lung, on my lower back and scattered around my spine/back. 


This news has just been devastating, to first find out the lump on my neck that my doctor said was nothing is cancer was manageable, I had a plan and I knew I could do it. But now, I have seriously lost hope. I'm finding it so hard to find a case similar to how aggressive my lymphoma is. The removed lumps from my neck 2 weeks ago have already started to regrow, and the ones they didn't remove are getting bigger. 


My oncologist sounded disappointed when she called me to explain the PET results, she was hoping it wouldn't be so widespread so quickly, adding to my overall fear. At least I finally stopped getting fucked over by not being prescribed opiates for my debilitating back pain, I had a work related injury that just so happens to be right where the growth is and they were reluctant to prescribe anything since its ""workers compensation."" 



I need some advice and hope. I have my bone marrow biopsy coming up next week, and my first therapist appointment tomorrow. I still need my lung test and heart ultrasound, which scares me to see what they might find since I've only gotten bad news back. 


Has anyone been down a path similar to mine? Even if you haven't I would like to hear from people and their respective journeys. 



Much love and hope to everyone."

Is it rude to go to a quiet part of the house until they leave and then reenter communal areas when they're gone? I often get stressed out when strange people are in my house without me knowing ahead of time, and I find that is a terrible time to introduce oneself (when visibly agitated) because the guests know they've upset you but can't figure out why.

In normal circumstances I always greet the household when I come home. But if guests are over I sneak away to be alone until they leave. I feel like this is rude but being impatient/agitated with guests because they disrupted my plans/routine/environment is more rude."

Some of you may have read my posts about my journey. I did the 90 day detox and then successfully underwent a body transformation with fitness.

Last week I injured myself while training and was not able to work out for 10 days. That was really hard. It reminded me of how I felt after I stopped playing.

I think we feel that way whenever we get out of our comfort zone. But I think great things can come from the same thing.

As i continue to change it's not getting easier. And sometimes I wish it would. But as my coach says: if you want to achieve what you never achieved before, you have to do what you've never done before.

Over the last 6\-8 months I became a person who preps all his meals, goes to the gym 5 days a week. I go mountainbiking at least once a week and I've spent a lot of time learning to edit videos and operating DSLR cameras.

I'm trying to work to a point where I can create high quality youtube videos and it will take a lot of time to get there. And honestly it's been brutal to make myself sit down and study those things :\). But I will continue to do so.

because i am getting older each day, years are passing by, i am dynamically changing, college studies are getting me frustrated, this is getting me frustrated too and because of this i am becoming more ""violent"". violent in a sense that, i am deleting away the personality of me when i was nice to everyone. i am no longer taking shit from anybody, if something bothers me i say it. if a girl starts drama i stop it. if someone talks about something and i believe thats wasting my time, i just cut him/her off and go straight to the point. i am becoming more aggressive each day. you may call me a douche or an asshole, and that's okay too, because i no longer give a fuck about other peoples opinions.

i appreciate the truth no matter how hard it is and i do not forgive lies. advice is not an opinion and i am here for your advice. i need an honest advice. if am i doing something wrong, tell me so i can fix it.

nd,"So I never played Diablo 1 or 2, but I played D3 for probably 1000 hours on PS4 before getting it on PC and logging another 500 or so thus far. I then got it in my head that to really enjoy the franchise I should play the first two, or at least try them.

I went ahead and nabbed D1 with the Beelzebub mod and...WOW what a phenomenal game. That Beelz mod made it probably way harder than it originally was (what with adding all the cut quests) but it was intensely fun and rewarding to sit down for a weekend and play through the history of the Darkening of Tristam.

I'm just booting up D2:LoD today, and considering how much people lose their shit over that game I can only imagine how much fun I'll have there as well. 

Just wanted to share my appreciation for the franchise and thank the subreddit for building up the games to the point that I needed to go back and give them a shot 20 years after release."

nd,"So I have got this kind if awful feeling. Like a bad feeling in my gut. I'm stressed out. The ex started talking to me again and I feel like Im reliving some of the worst parts of our old relationship. I keep remembering those sleepless nights in chicago where I lied there, terrified of what would happen to us. I probably cared a little too much. I thought I was over her, but I only forgot about her. Now I just sit around hoping to hear my phone buzz. I have a billion words I want to say, but I can't because I'm scared that I might scare her away. I want to talk. I want some closure. I hate to say it, but I think I might want to try again. She said that she worked through her issues. And I'm super happy for her. I keep thinking it over in my head. What Happened all of the sudden that made her want to start talking to me? Does she also want to try over? Am I just Naive? Does she just want to be friends? How do I ask what she wants without making it seem like I don't want to start over? Why can't I just be straight forward? I said that I am reliving some of those stressful memories, but I have been reliving them every day since we split up. Maybe she is the only person who can help me move past it. She's sorry and so am I. I completely accept her apology. But I think that I'm still hurting, and I dont want to. If we start over will I hurt myself even more, or will I find closure? If I start again, will she be able to let me down gently? Im not superman. I just want a quick way out of all this stress. I feel hot in my chest. And when I think about it, all I want to do is hold her close to me and hug her. But I can't. I hate that I'm so torn. Its not healthy. Maybe I need to work out my own issues before I think about trying over."
nd,"I was (potentially) exposed 8 days before I took my blood test. Since exposure, I've developed many of the symptoms of HSV - 2 painless lesions (far apart from each other), painful urination, tender/enlarged lymph nodes in the groin. No other symptoms though (fever, flu, etc).

However, my blood test just came back and shows &lt;0.90 IGG for both type 1 and 2. A urine sample recently ruled out other common STDs.

Could it still be possible that I have HSV and tested too soon? I had all of my current symptoms at the time of the test and nothing has changed since then. The last time I saw my Dr, he didn't even want to do a swab because he said it didn't look like herpes to him. I'm going back today to make sense of all this.

Thanks for any insight."
nd,"My experience with girls online vs in real life is like day and night. I get little to no replies to my messages and no matches on tinder despite some good pictures and a well\-written profile. It blows my mind that there are some guys out there whose social calendar is so booked up due to tinder matches that he has to reduce his dates to just going for a walk in the park cause he wants to control how much he drinks per week. When I hear guys having this kinda experience, it makes me feel extremely bad about my experience with online dating. I was scarred by it for the longest time because it's like, am I just that unattractive? 

Except I notice that girls pay more attention to me when I'm engaged in my hobbies. I'm a ballroom dancer. I'm not even that good. But I love it. I do it more like a sport/fitness than for anything else. When girls find out I can dance, their attitude towards me totally changes. Gone are the cold stares and the rolling eyes of disinterest. Suddenly, I can see their pupils because they're staring at me as if trying to analyze me. 

I'm not trying to toot my horn here. I don't dance because it gets me girls. If you know anything about the ballroom dance community, it's super old school and primarily consists of men and women in their late 40's and up who are already coupled up or divorced or widowed. I got into it because I'm a history fanatic and I remember watching movies of european aristocratic couples doing the waltz at the ballroom and wanted to learn to do that. But a lot of the skills I've learnt translates well to latin dancing like salsa, etc. which is heavily populated by a younger crowd, especially women. When you can master one dance, you can easily master another. It's like learning languages. 

I've gotten girls who bought me beer. And who struck up a conversation with me without me doing anything. There was this one girl who was willing to go home with me one night. Mind you, I'm not even that good. There are other male dancers who dance a lot better. I'm not sure if they're getting a lot of the same responses. I know one guy who is a lot better than me but he doesn't seem to get anything. So I'm thinking it's not because I dance that makes me more attractive. Maybe it's a combination. Maybe I just look more in my element and confident and non\-desperate when I dance? Or maybe I stand out cause I look like someone who can't dance but that I actually can? I don't know what it is. 

The thing is, on my online dating profiles, I put up pictures of me during dance competitions and all that. But women never reply and are never interested."

nd,"Does anyone have any experience with a low lying placenta? I am 27 weeks tomorrow and have had some spotting for the past 6 days and through ultrasound was told I had the placenta issue.

Debated some of the bundles in ""specials"" in the web shop, but they all come bundled with things I just don't need (credits, port slot and additional captains)...

I heard a bit of a hassle going on at a new cashier's register, so I stepped over to see what was going on.  The cashier was trying to find his bonus card account. Our default is to search by name, but he was insisting on using his phone number, which is possible but it  takes a few extra steps.  After a few tries we were not able to match his account with any of the phone numbers he provided. 
 
Cashier will be New Cashier (NC), I will be ME, and the customer will be Condescending Old Know-it-all (COK)

NC:  ""Nothing is coming up, can we try with your last name?""

COK: ""Why isn't it working with my phone number? Are you typing it correctly?  I don't understand why it's not working!""

NC:  ""I think maybe it's under a different phone number maybe?""

COK: ""There is no other phone number!""

NC: ""I think maybe....""

COK: ""I don't care about what you *THINK*, I want to hear what you *KNOW*!""

(At this point I step over)

ME: ""Sometimes when folks fill out the bonus application they don't provide a phone number,  it's not required.""

COK: ""Well why not? Why is this so difficult?""

ME: ""I don't know, can we....""

COK: ""Why don't you know?""

ME: ""Can we just try to find you account with your name?""

COK: ""Fine. It's CondescendingOldKnowItAll; C... O...N...D..E... "" 
(proceeds to spell out name as slowly and deliberately as possible)

NC: ""Ok, there are two names here, a Bill and a Shirley...""

COK: ""Neither of those are me...""

NC: (gives street names associated with accounts) ""Is one of those your address?""

COK: ""Yes, I live on West Angry Lane, but I'm not Shirley!""

NC: ""Um... is Shirley your wife?""

COK: ""Yes.""

NC: ""OK then... "" (Rings up transaction)

COK: *still grumbling about why we couldn't find his account with a phone number* 

ME: ""I can look up your account over here and see if there is a phone number listed... no,  there is no phone number associated with your account.""

COK: ""Well why not?""

ME: ""It looks like Shirley did not provide a phone number when she applied.""

COK: ""Why not?"" 

ME: ""I don't know... as I said, it's not required, she probably chose not too.""

COK: (grumbles some more)

ME: ""Would you like to add a phone number to the account?""

COK: ""*HOW* are you going to do that?""

ME: ""Just fill out this form and I'll have the office add it.""

He fills it out,  I read his phone number back to him because God knows I want to make sure it gets into the system correctly. 

ME: 555-555-0792 

COK: ""555-555-*ZERO* 792...  Zero, not O!""  

ME: ""OK....""

COK: ""*ZERO* is a number, *O* is a letter...  Do you even know the difference?""

ME: ""I'm pretty sure I do.""

COK: ""Why does everything have to be so difficult!""

&lt;-- Previous card: [Letho of Gulet](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwent/comments/8i3rof/daily_card_discussion_466_letho_of_gulet_may_9th/)"
nd,"Hey guys. I've recently started serving with no prior experience. I've worked many different jobs but never something with this sort of a learning curve. I know it's basically the same in every place as a server it's just new to me because it's a system I'm not familiar with (I'm only just figuring out myself how to update checks and do my report) so I will admit it feels a bit overwhelming. I usually work 10 hours from 5PM to 3AM, sometimes 11. It gets very busy as we have a front patio section, a beer garden, then first and second floors. My first week I was assigned to the first floor and now these past two I've been assigned beer garden. It's almost like just when I had one section figured out I was sent to an entirely different terrain to fight on. That's okay though. I just want so badly to learn this.

I'm definitely having the most difficultly with the tablet we carry around (it's used for literally everything, sending orders to the kitchen/bar and including credit card payments, although they still can be done via the computer console in the back). The application is called Toast and I'm sure many of you know it inside and out. For instance I'll be serving a table of five, and when I can't find what they want on the tablet (not everything is in order) my brain puts up the ""Oh shit"" barrier. I've tried my best learning the menu but some of the monthly specials just don't correspond to what's on the tablet screen. Sometimes I fuck up on table numbers and get them backwards. I'm usually pretty laid back about these kinds of things but I'm new serving sometimes six, seven tables at once (I know that's probably nothing compared to the absolute gods in this business) and when I get hung up on one little thing it just fucks up my whole apple cart. It's so difficult sometimes remembering everything about my tables. 

The boss is tough but fair. We have one nighttime manager who has the patience of a saint. Whenever I have a malfunction I feel like such an asshole having him repeat a step or two. I honestly hate the kitchen staff. I understand they need things done right but they talk so much shit whenever I make a mistake. I almost walked off last week because he raised his voice to me. I've got very thick skin but he was legitimately just being a prick.

The reception is entirely different though. Since training day number one I've been told I'm doing a very good job. My tips on my first busy night were very good, and everyone keeps saying I'll be fine in a couple of weeks. I'm fast, charismatic, never have empty hands, and always lend a hand once my own tables are settled in and I have the time. I have a bad habit of being my own worst critic so maybe that's the case. I have anxiety before starting but the anticipation always turns out worse than the outcome (other than that kitchen staff incident)

I appreciate you bearing with me for this long. I found this sub by accident on Google and honestly felt very relieved. I feel like I'm living on a different planet. The hours, the schedule, the routine. None of it bothers me except my own mistakes. Is the learning process always this difficult? Am I just being too hard on myself? Does anyone else remember their first rodeo?

Thank you again."
nd,"I've found my hair dries best naturally (no blow dryer, diffuser, or anything). But is showing up to work with wet or damp hair considered unprofessional? My 'second day' curls usually floof up and don't look good (I probably need to find a different routine for that though!), so I like to wet my hair every morning and let it dry over the next few hours. This was fine to do in college, but is it unacceptable in the workplace?"
nd,"I found you again this morning. I wasn't at all prepared for how much it stung. 
You're seeking to replace me. Mimicking the way we met on here.
But I know you're hurting and I know you need all the love and attention a kitten deserves and I'm sorry it seems we can't even be friends. 
I want desperately to help you feel good again. For you to be happy. Its all I ever wanted. 

The last time you did this you admitted it was to draw me out of the woodwork. It worked. And I must admit the temptation to reach out once more is almost greater than I can bare. But you made it perfectly clear, when last I tried that I was wasting my time.

I don't want to be responsible for any more upset in your life and I will always do my utmost to respect the boundaries you have set. 

As much as writing and acknowledging this hurts, I'd rather have the pain of remembering you than a life with no memory of you at all.

Everything went up in smoke. Literally. 
Everything but my memories and my heart. And you're in them both.

Forever.

nd,"This is going to rant at points, because its pretty early and I haven't really slept. 

I've only really had two long term relationships that mattered to me. One that broke up when I was 20 and i sunk into a deep depression and went full off the rails with drugs and alcohol. It took me years to recover and a few shitty relationships until I met my ex at 25(it was on Tinder but I just feel I got lucky, though I don't know if I could ever trust her intentions. Was that my head or was it real?) Now, it's been a year since she left and I still don't know what to do. 

I'm always seeing the whole thing that people with BPD have no problem attracting people and everyone around here seems to be having a ton of sex. I just feel like I've lost the desire, I don't feel much attraction to anyone and I'm not sure they feel anything to me. It's been about 5 months since I've even been on a date and an embarrassing amount since I got laid last. I just feel like I'd recoil at the slightest touch and I don't feel like I can be comfortable and trust anyone. How do you deal with it? 

I think of my ex pretty much all day everyday. She hasn't spoken to me in a year and I learned from some insta stalking (i've blocked her so I can't see how happy her life is without me) that she moved away. I just don't get why I'm not good enough to even get a word, since when we were together there were multiple exs from across the country she kept in contact with? Do I just ruin people's lives that much that no one wants to ever see how I'm doing? I know these aren't questions I'm supposed to have answered, I just need to get some of this out. I can't cry every morning and sit at work and just breakdown all the time because of a girl obviously doesn't care about me, but I can't stop. I just can't move on."

nd,"Hey all, I just beat Gehrman and Moon Presence in my first playthrough and entered NG+.  I'm still a bit confused about how stats scaling and weapons work, especially pertaining to the Arcane stat.

My character is level 83 and I poured everything into Vitality, Endurance, Strength and Skill.  I did not touch Arcane or BT.  I also did not use any weapons that dealt anything other than physical damage (my main weapons were Ludwig's and Saw Cleaver).

In my NG+, I just bought the Burial Blade and noticed that it does Arcane damage. I'd like to use this weapon, and others that deal Arcane, like Blade of Mercy. My question is basically: are weapons that deal arcane damage viable if you haven't leveled Arcane?  I noticed the Burial Blade also scales with non-Arcane stats, but I don't understand how the scaling relates to the damage output types.  

I'm also considering dumping most my first NG+ levels into Arcane to make Arcane weapons more viable.  Is that a smart move if I'm not strictly doing an ""Arcane Build""?

nd,"So it has been a year now that I have been getting headaches at least 5 days a week. I am 19 years old and I have gone to my neurologist who said that I need an MRI. Results came back and nothing bad was shown. I have been taking ibuprofen and excedrin every other day and it only helps for a few hours. I go to bed with the headaches and wake up with them as well. I stay hydrated, exercise frequently, but nothing seems to help. Sometimes it comes to a point that I just want to give up, what can I do?"

Does writing a play in Shakespearean automatically obligate me to writing it in pentameter? Or can I just write it in the language?

nd,"sometimes the flexing of a muscle feels so wonderful? Right now on one hit of weed after a 24 hour tolerance break clenching my butt cheeks and thighs  really hard while I walk feels so good. One time on a little mild daytrip i had once on like 2 grams of shrooms (supposed to be 1/8th in a piece of chocolate form) hitting a little light  and 150mg dxm to amplify it I went for a walk on a nice sunny day and it literally felt orgasmic to flex my calves as I walked down the sidewalk. Not a super intense trip or anything but I've felt many times, especially on acid getting bloodflow into your muscles feels like you're pumping yourself full of love

nd,"My wife the other day admitted in counseling that she “fell” for her boss. It really hit me and she didn’t want to talk about it much. The counselor suspected she had someone/had a crush on someone. 

It makes sense now, the distance, lack of affection, easily angered. We had a fight and she threatened to move in with him and has become a lot more hostile towards me. 

I was under the impression that he is married, but apparently not and has gotten a divorce (he’s been divorced multiple times).

I’m not sure what’s happening. My wife is the sweetest, beautiful, most hard working woman I know. However she’s having this side to her that isn’t her and it’s frightening. If she really feels this way why hasn’t she left me yet."

I just ordered 100 grams of phenibut for my first time. I plan on dosing twice a week \(Mondays and Fridays\). I read most people that say this wont effect tolerance much and won't leave me with any withdrawal.

A normal day for me usually starts 6AM, going to the gym, eat and rest, then head for class at uni, lunch, class, cooking next day's meal and then studying/gaming till 10PM.

But when there is no pressure from having stuff to do, all I find myself doing is absolutely nothing. It wrecks my sleep schedule and what usually is my daily routines. For example, I go on for days without leaving the bed or apartment, eating, cooking or gaming because nothing feels rewarding – in the sense that I'm not working toward some goal of the day.

nd,I just noticed portal knights and Lego world's we're on the switch. I was wondering which one is better or if there both bad. Thanks in advance :)
nd,"Hey!

So I guess I'll just start off with a fun story? Did you know I originally created this account as a throwaway for r4r but I've just decided to keep it as my main. (this is probably because I just don't want to log my account over)

Anyway a bit about me? I'm currently on a really big 'be better' kick in my life. I guess last year I just sort of felt the gravity of how poorly I've spent a lot of my life living and wanted to turn things around. This has resulted in a lot of really awesome experiences for me from things to rediscovering a love of cooking and being more physically active. It's been tough but lets just say I'm happy with the habits I'm building. What eventually ended up happening because of my poor lifestyle choices was that I lost a lot of connections with people. Most of it gradual and not really 'negative'. I didn't go around burning bridges or anything I just sort of faded out of a lot of people's lives.

ANYWAY! that's where you maybe come in? I'm just looking to get back into meeting new people and enjoying that whole sort of thing. I'm hoping maybe I've put enough out there to maybe seem like I can hold a conversation at least half decently so if you'd like to get to know me more, or even just have any thoughts our questions please let me know.

Thanks for taking the time to read this if you did and have a great day/evening/life."

nd,"So the Bravia recently decided it didn't want to play nice with the internet.  I've spent the last 4-5 hours straight troubleshooting it, going through Sony's guides, going through third party suggestions, searching for [solved] threads and trying the solution, all to no avail.

I did everything listed on this page: https://esupport.sony.com/US/p/support-info.pl?info_id=1727&amp;mdl=XBR55X850C&amp;kbid=00159487

The light never turned green for me but it reset nonetheless.  I don't think it worked because it would just stay in a ""Checking for updates"" loop forever, so I reset it again as the guide suggested.  Three times now, no luck.

I tried making sure the time was set correctly, because there is a suprisingly large amount of threads where someone had the same problem and fixed it by turning auto-set time to off and setting it manually.  I've even seen a thread where the opposite worked, turning auto-set time on.  Neither worked for me.

I downloaded the most recent firmware onto a USB and plugged it in like Sony suggested, but the TV just told me I was already up to date.

I tried opening up the router gateway and inputting all the connection info manually, including setting the DNS to 8.8.8.8 and the secondary to 8.8.4.4.  I tried connecting with the WPS button, and I tried putting in the network password manually.  All three of these gave a successful connection message, but no apps can connect, and the WiFi square in the top left of home menu says ""Wifi has no internet access"".

I made sure security was set to WPA-PSK [TKIP] + WPA2-PSK [AES], and I made sure MAC filtering was set to ""Allow - All"".  

*The funny thing is, right when I was about ready to give up, I randomly chose YouTube to test the internet instead of Google Play store, and it worked.  I looked up a few YouTubes and watches some videos, it worked flawlessly, and it loaded fast and streamed in 4K where available and in 1080p where it wasn't - with little to no delay.  But only YouTube.  I also tested Amazon Prime, HBO Go, HBO Now, Netflix, and a few others - none of those worked.*"
nd,"I recently obtained a used Dell Latitude E7450(Top-end configuration in every way plus 16GB total RAM, I got lucky getting this thing very cheaply in a liquidation sale, though that does mean that it's well out of warranty) and the headphone jack hasn't been recognizing anything at all. I've tried two pairs of headphones, one with a 2-ring connector and one with a 3-ring connector, and neither registered in any way in the jack. No changes in Device Manager, no new playback devices, not even the crackle in the headphones that comes with me plugging them into anything else. Here's a list of what I've tried so far with zero effect on anything:

Performed a full driver update with Dell Support Assistant, including BIOS update.

Switched drivers from ""Realtek Audio"" to ""High Definition Audio Device"" and rebooted

Deleted audio drivers completely and rebooted

Disabled both speakers and onboard mic in the ""playback devices"" panel

I'd normally just say that this is a hardware problem and use a USB adapter, but this seems to be a problem that happens frequently and has a great many causes in Dell laptops, so maybe I'm missing something. Also, the audio with an adapter is nothing short of awful, with a persistent background hiss and an almost distant sound.

EDIT: Also worth noting that the jack appears completely unpowered. There's no crackle when plugging a pair of headphones in at all. It's likely to have something to do with power management but I have no idea what."

nd,"Hello reddit. 

I am someone who is unfortunately very unsure of myself, always second guessing myself, and a pushover. However, I recently noticed something at my library I felt was alarming and brought it to the attention of the supervisor at the library. I'm going to copy and paste my email here \(with identifying information redacted obviously\), and I just wanted to get your views. Did I make the right choice in bringing this behavior to the supervisor? 

Subject: Extreme concern about an \[sic, yes I made that typo lol\] student employee's repeated behavior at the library

Dear \[supervisor name\]:

     Hello, my name is \[redacted\], and I am a \[my affiliation with my university\]. I am writing to you now because I was referred to you by a student at the circulation desk at the library so that I may relay a serious concern I have to you about someone I believe is an employee at the circulation desk, because I have seen him work there.  

     This individual is constantly arguing with someone on the \[area of the\] library near the front desk, and this has occurred at least a few dozen times. It is extremely disturbing to me and to other students and several peers of mine have taken notice and are concerned. He often expresses extreme rage and anger, yelling on the phone, complete with an entire bevy of swear words. After every one of his arguments, he begins hitting himself on the head really angrily. Not only is his behavior alarming, but the content of his recent conversations are also cause for concern. The first time I noted his behavior was in November 2016, and I was so alarmed that I alerted a security guard about it. It is somehow still going on. Some snippets from his arguments I have heard recently include:

""I'm going to do something drastic."" 

""I'm going to take incredibly drastic action."" 

""Fuck you fuck you fuck you."" 

""I'm going to go to his office and put it into his head."" \(I did not catch what ""it"" was referring to, but he was extremely angry and animated as he said this so I am frightened to find out\). 

     The content of his arguments are frequently very vulgar and have recently become violent in nature. It is extremely disruptive to my and other students' studies, and I believe any reasonable person who after seeing this consistently disturbing behavior would be concerned. He frequently yells on the phone as well as with another female student, who is potentially his girlfriend. This individual appears \[I give a very detailed description of the individual, would be impossible not to identify him with all this information\]. 

     I also wish to remain anonymous if possible. This is not an individual I would want knowing my identity or knowing that I have brought these issues to your attention. Based on the consistent pattern of angry outbursts and violent content of his conversations, I strongly believe that this individual may need intensive counseling before it becomes too late. If not, I fear the worst. 

Please let me know if there is anything else I may do.

Sincerely,

\[my name\]"

nd,"To be honest I feel terrible, but it's been a 2.5 months since we broke up and I still think about her.  I have other things I have to prioritize like college but I still see her around campus.  I didn't say anything before I did I though and I feel like I should've mentioned something but I really can't take it anymore with the stress of finals looming around as well.

We're not on bad terms, there was no argument or anything and I still talk to her every now and again, but it's really getting to me, Half the time I can barely talk to her without feeling terrible or worn out.  I know she moved on a long time ago and I don't think checking on her status and stuff a whole bunch is doing well for me emotionally.

nd,"I know I know, read the sidebar, I've done that but it doesn't answer this question.

So I'm on day five or so of my most successful attempt yet at tapering off about three-plus years of heavy, heavy daily drinking. I've come to terms with the obvious - no sleep, and I mean literally none, just laying there awake for days at a time, sweating and eventually getting a couple of hours of the ""release"" of tossing turning with my eyes closed having the most vivid nightmares. I'm obviously very irritable all the time, you know the drill.

The good news is I've cut down my overall consumption considerably - my guess is by at least half, maybe even more, hard to tell because I only drink mixed drinks.

My question is, what is the more effective way of going about it - steadily but very very slowly sipping throughout the day (and I mean one tall stiff mixed drink as opposed to the six or seven I would drink when I was getting shitfaced) which is what I've been doing, or drinking nothing and sweating it out until I absolutely can't take it anymore (as in walking wobbly, visibly shaking) and then drinking just enough to be okay again.

Which one if any is going to cause kindling? The first way seems like it will be a slower but slightly less unbearable process, while the second way might be faster, I just don't know if it's dangerous."

There’s an unneeded pedestal which love is placed upon where it’s set to be this perfect thing. Is its faults, it’s sore bones, and it’s rough voice not what leads us in? Does just its name not drag you in, like it does to me? The whisper of “my darling” claws my back, and I wake up.

a) Detachable ends for two hands. Why have your two hands stuck together? It's unneeded. (The ad will have ""why be handcuffed? break free!)

b) Each hand will have an analog stick. That's an improvement over the wiimote (it only had one on the nunchuk). Also it would be better than Joy-Cons (the right stick is awkward and it could have a second L/ZL button at the top (the side ones might be odd)). On the wiimote reference, that stick could be on the left of the right dpad or on the right of the current nunchuk stick (with a button in place of the current stick) etc.

nd,"Hello so a little backstory here.

Me \(19 M\) and this girl \(22\) started talking to each other about 3 months ago online through discord which we use as a voice programme to play games/chill out on. We have known each other for about a year give or take but one day she pops up asking if im busy and if i wanna talk. So i'm like sure and we enter a private call and we chill out for a couple of hours. Fast forward a few weeks and we are talking every single day and having 6/7 hour sessions where we are just talking to each other alone or with our friends. At this point i will admit i had started getting some feelings for her and decided it would be best to talk to her about it. Now this part is important, Whilst i was turned down and we continued our friendship she was excellent at not making it awkward between us. It got brought up jokingly a few times and we just laughed it off. Again fast forwarding we are still extremely close and consider each other best friends. We know lots of personal things about each other and have told each other some secrets that other people do not know. About 5 days ago she starts acting a bit weird around me, hardly chatting to me in DM's and when we are in voice together being a bit distant. So i asked her ""Hey is everything okay between us"" and i got a response that i wasn't expecting.

She had basically said that she felt as if i only got on to play games whenever she was on and i would just wait around for her to play games and join with her and that she feels that we both need to take a step back because it feels like we are in a relationship and that i am trying to spend every second with her.  At first i was a bit shocked and did the obvious ""Can i call you can we talk about this"", ""Hey we need to talk"" and i would just get the same responses. ""Nah i'm not in the mood"" Which was fine i decided she probably just wanted some breathing room and that maybe i had been a bit too much for her. So we don't talk at all for a couple of days and then im in a voice channel with some of my friends and she joins and we just start chatting like normal again. However when everyone else logs off and its just us alone in the room it's suddenly ""I'm gonna go off and watch some netflix or youtube, bhai"" and this happens a few times over and over again. 

Recently she starts acting a bit snarky towards me and even a little hostile. I've asked for some advice from personal friends and it's the same, give her space. I spoke to my brother and he said that unfortunately when something like this happens it usually means the relationship of any kind is over but if i want it to continue just continue talking to her as if she was a normal friend and don't ask her if it's okay to talk to her, okay to join the channel with her. Do what i want and if she isn't into it she will tell me or she will leave.

I really don't want the friendship to end between us but im at wit's end here and haven't got a clue where to go from here. If any of you have had similar problems and have managed to deal with them just let me know your experience in the matter or any advice you could give me to either let it go or to help mend the relationship. Thanks"
nd,"I lost my husband in an accident on Apil 9th and I am currently 6 months pregnant with twins.  It just hit me that not only am I going to have to figure out how to live without him, but I'm going to have to figure out how to raise twins on my own.  We were anxious about doing it together and now I'm terrified to do it on my own.  I also have a 3 year old.  I have been given a ton of support these last few weeks and promises for help once the babies arrive.  As well intentioned as people are, I know realistically I will be doing this on my own.  For those of you who have doe this as single parents, what can I do to prepare?  Any tips from anyone would be very much appreciated."
nd,"I'm in PA\-United States. Currently job hunting, and I was looking around for things that may come up on a background check.  I just noticed a new line appeared recently on a docket sheet from a couple years ago regarding a withdrawn charge. This is the line on the docket:

\&gt;Entry: 

\&gt;Court of Common Pleas Review for Pre\-Disposition Matter

\&gt;Filer:

\&gt;Court of Common Pleas

\&gt;Applies to:

\&gt; \[My name\], Defendant

So, I guess my question is, what is the meaning of the phrase ""Court of Common Pleas Review for Pre\-Disposition Matter"", and is this something I should look into or be concerned about?"

nd,"Well I’m a little late posting, by about a week, but I made it one whole year sober and still going strong. It’s amazing to think that even just less than 6 months ago I was struggling pretty bad still with PAWS and adjusting to sober life. I feel a million times better. Anyone else out there who may be struggling, stay the course. It gets so much better!"
nd,"I have Lupus Anti-coagulate and “Autoimmune NOS” which they strongly suspect is Lupus. I have had 4 skin biopsies, 3 of which said I had Interstitial granuloma dermatitis. I have had a low grade fever and headaches, so the rhum sent me to have a MRI of my head last Wednesday. It came back with abnormalities, so now I need to see Neuro and an ophthalmologist. They said they suspect idiopathic intracranial hypertension. 

Has anyone else dealt with this before? Can you share your experiences with me, so I know what to expect? 

I have had doctors tell me that they have never had a patient with the dermatitis or the clotting issues. I also have a history of having Neurofibroma...I feel like having multiple rare conditions must mean something...the alternative is that I’m just an unlucky freak of nature. 

Does everyone on this journey feel like they are crazy or that people think you are making things up? I feel like a hypochondriac...and then we get these whacked out results/ diagnoses and I feel shocked. I really just need to feel less alone. My family is trying to distract me- last night they had a dinner and I got tired and asked to go home- around that time neighbors dropped by and I was stuck for another 2 hours being conversational- it made me want to scream. I feel frustrated and alone...especially since my doctors don’t even understand what is going on with me. 

TL/DR: have bunch of weird Dx’s and feel crazy and alone."

nd,"Like seriously, all of them. I’m a 16 yo dude from the suburbs and I smoke about once every 2 weeks (mainly to have fun with friends but I also have IBS and inflammation in my colon that I would very much like to restrict). Anyways, today marks 3 weeks since I’ve gotten stoned; I took one hit of a dab pen 2 days ago but I don’t count that. I just woke up from a 12 hour long deep sleep and all of the dreams I can recall had bud in them. They go like this: finding a $50 and spending it all on bud, ripping a bong then going to a party, finding backwoods stashed in my garage then smoking them all. All my dreams are very vivid even if they’re for a 5 minute nap in class. I’ve also been having night sweats but that could be because of my heater/the hot weather. I don’t think I smoke enough to have an addiction but if anybody knows an explanation for this, I’d really like to hear it."

nd,"We were together for 1.5 years and felt like she was probably going to be the person I was going to grow old with.  However, like many of the stories in here, the breakup of what seemed to be a great relationship came out of nowhere after an intense argument about feeling disconnected for a few weeks.  We shared an apartment, had a dog, countless trips, and heard from each other every day for that year and a half.  And just like that, life feels as though it slipped through my fingers and skipped forward into the next track without wondering if that was a preference of mine.

She was young (mid-20s) I'm older (mid-30s) and I knew going into it she was headed towards some life changes as all people do.  I thought I'd be able to endure that time.

In the weeks following, she had already started ""making friends"" with someone she had met during our last week together.  I don't know if it's a serious relationship or if just friends, I don't really think it matters.

We still remain semi-friendly outside of the blow up moments where neither one of us could handle the intensity of what we were going to do in the near future.  She wanted to stay friends like she has for her previous bfs (her phone was always dinging with messages from other dudes who were just friends) but I can't do that.

I change my phone number, close out my social media, and start the NC phase of things while she's still looking for a new place to live.  She's not happy about this, but she knows why and its clearer to her that I don't plan on being a presence after she gives me my key.

Fast forward to last night where she gave me back my key after several week long process of her moving out and I feel like I've broken up with her for what feels like the third time in a month.  She cried, I stayed unemotional as she said ""please?"" for one last hug.  We kiss.  I hear her say goodbye as I round the corner walking away from her and I hear the door close............. I'll never forget that sound.

I've gone through nastier breakups that had me melt into the floor like a puddle of pathetic so I know the phases of breaking up, but this is the first breakup in my 36 years of life that I was absolutely closed off from any chance of closure other than ""whelp... I guess that's it"".

In the weeks leading up to the key exchange, we communicated through email.  I let it be known that after the key has been returned, I'm going to be saying goodbye... but I didn't want to.  We were GREAT friends.  But I can't stay friends... I'm not gonna watch as the person I love more than likely drifts to yet another life that has no room for me.

I have it in my head that NC is exactly what should be happening and as of this hour, it'll be 24 hours.  I didn't think this would happen, but in the weeks prior I felt as though the NC period would be easier because ""she did me wrong"" but its not.  I want to email her, tell her I don't hate her like she was worried about and that a friendship with her would be great, but dramatically difficult especially as life continues for both.

Which brings me to my question:  how does everyone stay in NC?  When you get that itch to reach out (good reasons and bad) how do you prevent that from happening?

I know it should be easy, and most days it is.  But sometimes telling yourself ""dude, she told you she doesn't love you like that"" isn't enough and the looping thought of reaching out to her being a good deal is on high volume repeat.

Thanks for any help you can provide.  Here's to another 24 hours..."
nd,"I decided to do some arenas because I'm bored but several times the enemy's team did not show up (as in their icons and stuff) either until the match started or sometimes not at all so I couldn't prepare for comps. It's especially frustrating when the person not showing up is a rogue so I don't know to look out for a barrage of stuns until its too late. 
This isn't happening 100% of the time, but its happening frequently enough that something is wrong and often it will be one or two people on the enemy team hidden making me think the other person is alone and then I get ambushed."

nd,"My favorite episodes are the ones where they have a flashback the whole episode and show a backstory of a character. I especially loved the flashback episode for The Governor. I was thinking that since people are talking about six episodes for Maggie and Rick they are going to need a few episodes without them in 9A. I think this would be the PERFECT opportunity for a good flashback episode showing Negan and some of his past, including his wife and daughter.

I think if they had someone going to chat with him in the cell and he told them his story it would be a good way to fill some episodes. Maybe a background episode and then an episode about him forming the saviors into what it was at it’s prime. Just a thought I had. Opinions on this?"

This thought keeps me awake at night; so far I have managed not to hurt myself (I have a history of self harm), but I don't know of I can keep any longer. I just feel so disappointed in mysel. I feel so stupid."

nd,"Hi all, wondering if anyone can give me some pointers on recovering my dogecoins.

Basically I have a wallet.dat file thats years old now. It was generated using the official client on a windows system.

I'm now without a windows system to use, I'm on ubuntu linux.

Can anyone guide me to info that will help me recover the wallet.dat on this system?

If having windows will make things easier I can find another PC to use, it would just be much easier for me to do it on what I have.

Any help much many so appreciates, wow."

Best specs are important here. Aiming for the i7 8550u with 16 GB of RAM and an SSD.

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
Somewhat.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
Windows.

13, 14, or 15

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
Integrated graphics of some kind would be a nice bonus. Not intended for gaming, but games like Darkest Dungeon or Stardew Valley are possible.

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
Light gaming, nothing intense.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
Build quality is a big concern. Would rather miss out on some thinness than lose build quality. At least one USB-A would also be nice.

Working for a small company that has given me up to $1,100 to work with. I've been watching XPS 2018 prices like a hawk but they're refusing to get down to that price point while still maintaining the features I need. Outside of ensuring the new laptop is a beast at processing (i7 + 16GB RAM) the biggest concern is build quality and longevity -- it will be years upon years before it is ever updated again. Going insane trying to find the best option out there!"

Such as naming, setting up the goals etc, but maybe have a limit of say, 3/4 tasks per level, keeping the points you get the same so it's not over powered. 

I wanted to make a sim who was an architect, but I thought about also making my own (not modded) aspiration for it where you just have to build your house with certain amount of items ala Mansion Baron, but more about build mode than buy mode.

Just randomly blabbering sorry, what other things could we do with a custom Aspiration tool?"

nd,"Hello! Just as the title says what can I do to add more fat to my dogs diet? She is a 2 year old GS, she is currently on a grain free diet as I’ve come to realize anything with grain in her kibble makes her super dry/itchy/ dandruff(y)! She gets 6c a day of her food and usually some eggs added since we also own chickens. She has ALWAYS been super super petite but the vet would like to see her put on about 10 lbs and so would I :) she’s very picky (my vet suggested a lamb and rice diet) but I don’t even know if she’d eat that, so what are some alternatives that are dog friendly that I could try to see if she’d even eat it? 

UPDATE: Thank you all for the replies, I will try a higher calorie food and add some other things to her diet like fish oil and wet food :)"
nd,"I'm not too good with cars and haven't done much work with them at all but I'm pretty young and dumb. I installed a short ram intake on my Hyundai Veloster Turbo but I've experienced 2 engine misfires and have been told that its likely just faulty coils. I've had them both replaced but is it possible that the air intake install is causing this? I read online from multiple forums and threads that cars do not necessarily require tunes after installing an air intake like I have. Now here are my questions: 

1) I've read that resetting the ECU by disconnecting the battery and holding the brake, then proceeding to drive for 30 minutes may cause the car to balance out the air/fuel ratio in the engine. Is this true and should I try it? 

2) Is a tune the way to fix this, or were the mechanics correct in saying that it could be faulty coils? I'm not sure how much a tune costs and I don't want to make the wrong move again. 

3) What step should I take next? 

Thank you in advance for any responses. Again, feel free to ridicule me if the air intake was a stupid idea. I didn't think too much before buying and installing it but it has now led me down an expensive path. Thanks!"

I feel like I can’t have a basic talk without her telling me to stop arguing. I ask her I’m not even arguing and that I’m just talking. 


**tldr : everytime I talk or ask my gf a question, she assumes that I’m arguing. When I keep asking her something, she tells me to stop it and that she doesn’t want to argue anymore. I’m confused because I’m not arguing, just asking a question because everytime I ask her a something, she says I’m turning it into a argument. Is she not interested in talking to me? I pointed out in the past she acts selfish and she got pissy because that is the truth. It seems the only way it doesn’t turn into An argument when we talk about my money lol.

nd,"We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent.

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is:
A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn't:
A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This morning since it’s a special sober day for me, I want to share my favorite poem. An odd choice for an atheist perhaps, but it really speaks to me, especially now.

Cast All Your Votes for Dancing by Hafiz:
I know the voice of depression
still calls to you. 
I know those habits that can ruin your life
still send their invitations. 
But you are with the Friend now.
And look so much stronger. 
You can stay that way
And even bloom!
Keep squeezing drops of the Sun 
From your prayers and work and music 
And from your companions' beautiful laughter. 
Keep squeezing drops of the Sun 
From the sacred hands and glance of your Beloved 
And, my dear, 
From the most insignificant movements
Of your own holy body. 
Learn to recognize the counterfeit coins 
That may buy you just a moment of pleasure, 
But then drag you for days 
Like a broken man Behind a farting camel. 
You are with the Friend now. 
Learn what actions of yours delight Him, 
What actions of yours bring freedom And Love. 
Whenever you say God's name, dear pilgrim, 
My ears wish my head was missing
So they could finally kiss each other 
And applaud all your nourishing wisdom!"

This is my second time doing keto after regaining weight a couple of years ago.

I have some pretty old cuts (&gt;4 yr) on my wrist. Thankfully they aren’t too terrible as cutting was never my “go to” method but they’re still quite visible. I work in the medical field so my hands and wrists are always visible as I’m examining patients or performing procedures. 

It makes me incredibly self conscious. What are my options? I don’t think skin grafts are a possibility for me. I would try doing a scar cream but I fear my scars are too old by now. Should I just wear an adhesive bandage to work everyday?"

I know many goth guys and pretty androgynous and can wear makeup just fine but they still tend to look pretty male.

He just never has time to hang out with me. I don't need to see this guy its just weird how we had a good thing going and he text me like he still wants it but never makes time. What do i do?

nd,"Hello everyone! After reading so many inspirational testimonials here,  I've decided to take it seriously and stop this ""bad habit"" once and for  all. 
 I didn't start it as young as most of you'all here, even  though I tasted it at 17, I didn't really appreciate it until 24. Now  I'm 29 and during the past 5 years I've smoked pretty much everyday,  definitely feeling like ""escaping"" from reality, together with all the  ""happiness""  and ""relaxation"" we understood to feel.
 Unconsciously, I  guess I was blaming the universe for all the bad stuff that was  happening. \[Mom had a non hodgkin's lymphoma \(now she's fine\); my ex  husband gave me HIV \(and now i'm fine with it\); and I realized I hate  being a lawyer \(still do\).\]
 I did try a couple of times to stop it,  but even if I felt better after a couple of days, I eventually start it  again, always making up excuses. I'm now realizing the big problem is  myself. 
 I'm smart and I guess I'd always make up excuses to smoke  or not to smoke, but the big conclusion is that my life is now quite  miserable  and I don't wanna grow older feeling like I've wasted this  lifetime opportunity to evolve. \( i do believe in karma\)
 Before 24, I  worked so hard, my life was a rollercoaster always going up. The past  years of smoking pot I must confess I've pretty much stayed in the same  position, not to say worse. Maybe it was a necessary phase, maybe not. I  just wanna it to be over and I'm hoping I can count on your support  here!  All the way from Rio de Janeiro, Brasil 🇧🇷️."

Needless to say, I'm a bit nervous about continuing to eat gluten for a week leading up to this test if that's what's causing this.

nd,"Hi all! I recieved my Eagle award in 2015 and was an avid scout growing up. I went all through cub scouts (not tiger scout), got my Arrow of Light, and transitioned into Boy Scouts. Going through puberty in Boy Scouts was like a breath of fresh air. I could hang with my friends, go rock climbing or hiking, and just shoot the shit without having to deal with any Middle School drama or worry about girls. This decision will change the entire aspect of Boy Scouts. 

In scouting, you learn to deal with problems among fellow guys- and for some it's comforting. For women, it can be very nice to go out with your girls and not have to deal with guys, so why is it so bad for guys to do the same?

At summer camps during my pubescent years, whenever there was a girl camper all the hormone driven boys would be driven to her like moths to a fire. You could never escape the fact of ""OMG that girl was helping us with kayaking she's so hot...etc"". With the introduction of girls into Scouting, it will get out of hand. 

Unless you have total separation of the genders in scouting, they will descend into hormonal madness in puberty. This makes scouting no different than school- go to class (camp/outing), see girls, make asses out of yourself, not focusing on your work.

Honestly, I do not support this. I am torn at this decision."

Last week, my a/c went out. I am just recovering from being very ill, and I have asthma, so I must have a/c. It’s still not fixed, but the initial service took $450.00 that I really didn’t have.

Last night, my 12 year old car began acting up. I just had the transmission replaced, ($7000.00) and between that and medical bills, I am not only financially but emotionally wiped out. 

I work very hard. I try to be a good person. But I’m at my wits end. If anyone can see their way to helping me, I would be so grateful. 

I only have $120.00, and the garage is going to cost at least $395.00. They are coming today, and I don’t want to write a bad check. But I can’t get my car out, so I can’t go to my second job. 

I’m off from my second job today, so I am lucky. I won’t be getting ANY more money for two weeks, unless I sell things. 

I am very appreciative of any assistance that you kind people can help me with. 

I now have $149.45. The bill was &amp;amp;395.00.

nd,"* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
$900-$1400 U.S. Ideally i'll be spending no more than 1000-1100ish, but i'm a fan of refurbished for a good deal if i'm getting a lot more for the money.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
Specs for the money. It will be used plugged in more often than not.

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
I.. don't really know. I don't know how heavy and thick newer laptops are. I have a 17inch asus g73sw I just started using again, and it's way too chunky for me. Weight and thinness aren't the number 1 priority, but I definitely wouldn't buy anything this thick and heavy again.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
 Windows. 

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
 15"" minimum. 17"" is probably preferred, but I won't pay a lot more for only those 2 inches. 

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
Gaming mostly. I'm sure i'll have photoshop/premiere installed, but the bulk of that kind of work will be done on a desktop rig, so video editing isn't the priority. 

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
Stable framrates are more important than ultra settings for me. I know it's a laptop and i'm not spending 3 grand. The most performance impact game will probably be the new WoW expansion. I don't play many of the AAA cinematic masterpeices, and if I grab something like Monster Hunter World, im fine with bumping down to medium-low to keep it at a stable 60fps. (120 if it's a 120hz panel?)

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
No need for touch screen, fingerprint reader, or optical drive. This thing will be backpacked and moved every day, so a build quality that can stand up to that for a few years. Good keyboard is a plus, touchpad is whatever. I'll be using a mouse most of the time.  

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
Sorry if I was a bit vague in my needs, this is my first laptop purchase since the asus g73 seven years ago, and I know even less about laptops now than I did then. It's really all I can compare to, and it's just a chunk. thick, heavy, loud. I do like the screen size, but i'm ok with going to a 15 if that means cutting a couple pounds. Again, i'm not really sure. Storage wasn't a question on the sheet, but I live off of external hd's, so as long as there's a 128gb ssd inside, i'm happy. Allocating all the money into performance specs and a decent build quality over what I would call ""consumer selling points"" (bells and whistles, storage space, RGB everything, etc.) is what's important to me."

nd,"Hi Everyone,

I stuck trying to figure out what happened.

Long story short&gt;
+ I got six pictures in an email.

+ I downloaded those pictures to a folder called ""pictures"" (they were the only pictures in the folder).

+ I installed Photoshop express, and used it to make 4 collages from the original 6 pictures. Photoshop stored these 4 pictures in the folder ""photoshopexpress""

The problem: I now had 10 pictures in 2 different folders.

+ I did not like the 4 collages I made, so I went into the photoshopexpress folder and deleted the 4 pictures.

+ **Then the mystery happens. When I browsed back to the original pictures in the ""pictures"" folder only two were there, meaning that 4 pictures have dissappeared.**

+ After I realised the pictures were gone, the tablet restarted itself for no reason, while I was still looking at the folder.

Again - Had 10 pictures in 2 folders - Deleted 4 pictures in one folder - 4 pictures disappeared from the next folder. Now I only have 2 pictures. Tablet restarted itself after pictures disappeared.

What I did to solve  the problem:

+ Checked files, and all folders on phone.
+ Ran malware scan with avg - nothing was found.
+ Cant figure out what else to do.

My conclusion

+ Something got corrupted.
+ There was a glitch with the photoshop program.

I'm stuck. Anyone got ideas?"

nd,"Hi all,

Just recently got into vaping and have picked myself up an iStick Pico 25. But, I seem to be burning through coils like no other. Initially I thought it was maybe a bad coil, so I picked up a few HW2s and HW3s, as well as a few extra HW1s. Priming properly for each, letting it soak \(have even left them to soak overnight\), pulling air through without hitting the burner and also starting at low wattage for first few hits etc.

They all start out great, but seem to lose all flavour and burn out by the time I've put about 5\-10ml of juice in them. Any suggestions, either something I am maybe doing wrong or another coil to try? Thanks!"
nd,"Hi guys,

We’ve been together for 3 years and now it looks like she decided to leave me.

My girlfriend has an abusive attitude and she always screams at me. Everything is my fault and that’s not just about our relationship. Even if she can’t achieve something, she’ll simply say it’s my fault (for example, she’s trying to write a book for years and she told me multiple times that she never wrote it because of me, since I don’t push her enough).

She has trouble waking up in the morning and that’s my fault because I don’t help her properly to wake up by herself. 

She enrolled in a two-weeks course for videography and she basically attended just one time; she told that’s my fault because I didn’t push her to go.

The list goes on.

On top of that, I can’t stand when she screams at me both in private and in public. I’ve tried to talk to her about this, but obviously that’s my fault as well. She screams because she’s upset with me, so I’m the one that shouldn’t upset her.

I don’t know if this is the end of our relationship or if she just needs to stay by herself for a while. She’s going to stay in her studio for now and I’ll keep staying in my apartment.

Despite all the horrible things, I’m finding it hard to stay away from here. Is there anything I should do?

I’m thinking about taking a flight and going back home to see my parents and stay there for a while, like a vacation.

Thank you!

TL;DR: I’m finding difficult to leave my girlfriend even if she’s emotional abusive with me (always screaming and everything is my fault)."

nd,"I had to stop seeing the therapist I've been going to twice a week since October. And I can't talk to her anymore basically ever because  it's against the rules. She was the only person I had to talk to and I can't stop crying about it. I really really liked her. It feels like someone died. 

I even told my mom yesterday that I was upset about it and she just said 'oh.' Nobody understands or even cares to understand. 

I've been repeatedly emotionally abused(?) by like 4 different guys all in the past two weeks. I've never called it that before but the disregard with which they treat me and how badly it hurts, I have to call it that. The most notable of them was one I really liked I met a month ago. We stopped talking because I could tell he was ghosting me so I told him to not text me anymore. But last week he texted me out of nowhere, unprompted, a week ago, and we talked for two hours and made plans for him to come and hang out with me this weekend. The night before everything was fine but of course the morning of, he flaked. He didn't even reply until after the time he was supposed to meet me, and it was bullshit. The worst part ist hat I 100% knew this was going to happen because EVERY GUY DOES THIS.  'little emergency/not looking good/ttyl' I told him to fuck off and that I wished he hadn't texted me. He didn't say anything after that, which was two days ago. I REALLY liked him and was getting over him and for him to come back into my life, tell me constantly how much I was his type and how attractive I was, how much I was wrong about him blowing me off the first time(!) only to burn me again...it hurts so fucking much. The whole week I was looking forward to seeing him because I was cautious but it felt like after the things he said, he wasn't going to blow me off. I can't stop crying about it either. I'm just so tired of being hurt by men. I feel so fucking worthless right now. What's wrong with me? How can they treat me like this, especially after everything I've divulged to them? It feels so sadistic. Literally nothing they say means ANYTHING. I CAN'T TAKE IT. 

I'm graduating from a school in a big city that I love. I have yet to find a job and am inundated with rejection emails every day. I have to go home to a city I hate, back to a family I don't at all connect with, and give up all my independence indefinitely. I'm going from going anywhere I want whenever I want to being stuck in the house all day, alone, depressed and miserable, just hoping someone will give me a job, which is even harder now that I don't live in ANY city that I'd like to work in. I also have no friends there. I don't know how I'm going to cope if I'm already completely falling apart. 

I'm going to be so alone. I feel so alone right now. I've been crying all day...I can't stop. I know my mom is excited to see me graduate but I'm just so miserable I'm going to ruin it for her and myself. I don't want to take pictures or smile or do anything. I don't even want to walk, honestly. I will but I just want to lie down and never get up. Then I feel bad for not being happy and positive. 

Graduating means losing literally everything that has kept me sane for the past few years, everything important to me. And I feel like I can't breathe. I can't even get myself to pack"
nd,"Background: I have 49K miles on my car and the maintenance symbol appeared on my dash so I went into the dealership to take care of it and get my car inspected.

They did the following:

* State inspection for $21.00
* Multi\-point vehicle inspection for free
* Rotated tires for $24.99
* Replaced air cabin and engine filter for $62.50 in parts and $57.00 in labor for a total of $120.00.

With tax, the total came to $227.96 when I was expecting closer to $75 so already feel ripped\-off, but then they wanted to do the following:

* Rear breaks serviced for $89.95
* Brake fluid exchanged for $99.95
* Alignment for $129
* Because of an oil leak, the breather plate needs to be resealed for $360

**About UglyVille**:

When creating UglyVille, I aimed to create a server that people could call a home. We try hard to tend to the needs of our members and give them a sense of value, when playing on my server; allowing everyone to suggest changes, improvements and plugins of which we discuss within our staff team and with the players on the server to best decide.


We're a Semi-Vanilla server with plugins like Dynmap, Essentials, PvpManager and GriefPrevention to add some extra depth to your gameplay. (You of course don't have to use any of these plugins if you don't want to). We also have plugins that add a little character to our server, examples being Marriage, and Chairs, which have been requested by players followed by AutoRank to reward players for their gameplay.


We have an economy in the server and for this very reason, we also allow players to create shops anywhere in the world. You start by simply punching a chest and allowing players to create a true business! You also have the opportunity to have a player portal at spawn that any players can visit! As the community grows and the server is open longer, we're starting to see towns and larger builds that players are able to show off!

We opened just over a month ago now and the community is becoming something I could have only hoped for. We recruited amazing active staff who are fun, friendly and skilled. We're taking suggestions and working hard to implement the things that players want to be added as well as fixing any bugs that might pop up all the time. We have a very skilled set of Engineers working on all kinds of stuff like mini-games; which have been created by some of our players and are nearing completion with many of them; you can gain crate keys as rewards for completion of a mini-game. 

#Come join and get a taste of the great ever-growing community, amazing staff, yourself and perhaps make UglyVille a new home for you and your friends!"

nd,"Okay so I’m very new to reddit and this community. But I have been into weight training since around 7th to 8th grade year (now I’m currently a senior). Well recently in the past year I tore my ACL, leaving me hindered to squat heavy weight. When I went and talked to a doctor, he told me that there are multiple ways to max on my squat. ( hence the multiple max squat idea was born).  Anyways, after vigorous training to try to combat my oppositions, I found myself to the fateful day (yesterday) and put a easy but good size weight of 225 of the squat rack. After what felt like forever or squatting and some blurry vision later, I had squatted 225 parallel for 38 reps, after putting it through the rep calculator, it ended up coming up to 510 pounds. But I’m very curious as to what you all have to think about it. After some research, the science says that the reps are accurate. But I still get some harassment saying it’s “cheating” and that repping isn’t “challenging” but this comes from people that have never tried to multiple rep max. Thanks for y’alls response."

nd,"Bf of two years. We're both in our mid 20s. We have anal sex once in a while, because he really likes it and I enjoy it somewhat as well, even if it's not my favorite. As he has expressed interest me playing with his butt, we've done a bit of that - rimming or using fingers. He also likes to be choked and talked down to. All of this, I don't really feel comfortable with, but as it turns him on a lot, I do it as long as we do a lot of other stuff too, that I enjoy tremendously.

However - he has now hinted that he would like to get pegged. I am completely turned off just by the thought. I can't get it out of my head, and it makes me a lot less attracted to him. I would do almost anything to pleasure my bf, but I can't bring myself to do this. I don't like being the dominant one in sexual situations, and pegging would bring it to a level I would not be able to stand. I also really don't want to hurt his feelings or express distaste for his tastes. And especially because it's becoming such a ""normal"" thing to do to men, it seems unfair to deny him getting pegged.

nd,"Hello, little background here, i'm 23 yo, started working a year ago. Three years ago, i ""confessed"" to a girl that i knew (let's call her A) for about a month. We met through a mutual friend during summer, she turned me down saying that things were going too fast, and that she wanted to enjoy her summer.
Going back to this year... Now A and I are very good friends, she moved to another city, but each time she gets back to the city i live in (her birth city) we have a (kind of) date. Now one month ago, after a date, she told me that she loves being with me, that we can always talk about anything and there isn't any akward blank like there is with her other dates. Each time i try to stop talking with her, she gets back at me and send a message asking me how is it going and plan our next ""date"". 
The thing that bothers me is that before A was always talking about her other dates and boyfriends with me, but suddently she stopped. A only talked about me and other girls, and never mentionned another men.
I started dating this other girl (let's call her B) 2 months ago, but as soon as i did, she suddently grew closer to me, now we speak everyday, even through i never send the first message :/
Now what's bothering me is that i feel that i wouldn't be able to move on and love another person as long as i feel that i still have a chance with A... It was one of our major fight with my ex(B) she told me that i couldn't see her anymore and that i had to choose, so i chose A.

Now here is my problem, i really like my friendship with A but i feel that if i try something, i might lose her. Yet, i feel that as long as i don't do something, i won't be able to move on.

Thank you for your advices, and feel free to ask if you need additional information :)"
nd,"Greetings, Custom Card Makers! Barriers have historically had the benefit and curse of being the easiest, yet dullest to balance. After all, their job is to end the run, and if they do that, they’ve done well!  

We’ve seen a new breed of barrier pop up though, barriers that stop the run, but can also do more! The ever infuriating Kakugo is a great example: even when it loses it wins. Sure not everybody can be as tricky as jinteki, but there's hope! We’ve also seen cards like Bio Vault be able to stop a runner in their tracks by sacrificing itself. Clearly, there's more to ending the run than being a big barrier. What else can we do in this space insert interesting decisions into play? How else can we balance server security in regards to costs paid, or opportunities lost?

So this week, you’re going to be creating cards that End the Run, but also do more! Be they Barriers, other Ice or possibly assets or upgrades. Will you go so far as to make a runner card that fits the bill?

---------------------

Next week, we'll be creating cards that play with deck building restrictions! As always, if you have fresh ideas for a future CCM, send them my way!

nd,"My dermatologist prescribed me 10% Benzoyl Peroxide and the nurse told me I could go ahead and keep using my regular cleanser, Neutrogena   Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser.

I ask because the instructions say to not use anything else if you have sensitive skin and the BP seems like it would really dry me out.

Routine from tonight forward:

Am:

- Benzoyl Peroxide 10%

- Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser

- Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin 

- 1 Doxy-Cycline

Pm:

- Benzoyl Peroxide 10%

- Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser

- Curology

- Differin 

- Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin 

- 1 Doxy-Cycline

They really didn't give me much insight as to how to work my new things into my regular routine and I don't want to mess my skin up because I'm doing really well.

The Differin, Antibiotic, and BP are all new for me."
