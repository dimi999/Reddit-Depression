nd,"I have finally sort of found my basal and bolus rates. My nighttime basal is set perfect so that it is a straight line and hopefully keeps at it forever. I have started thinking about training 4 times a week again, haven’t been to the gym in about 3 months lol. My question is, how much of a difference will I see to my basal and bolus? Do I have do change it drastically again? If I train late at night, will I go low during the night, which previously was a perfect straight line at 5,8 mmol?"

The 3 kittens supposedly tore his pricey black-out curtains and he was having none of that.  Oi.  I just hope for their sake that they are still young enough and cute enough to still get adopted.

Meanwhile, the same concern still applies to this new one - as far as the cat will likely outlive him and then who will want to adopt it.  Sad, really."

nd,"Once again I’m back at it. You all probably know the story too! You’re playing video games till 4 in the morning, and right before you go to bed you think to yourself.. “Okay, I really want to stop playing. I want to develop relationships, spend more time with family, or develop a cool hobby!!” Then you wake up in the morning, go through the daily grind and are just ready to fall back into your regular routine.

I stopped for two years out of self interest, but had recently bought a PS4, and told myself I’d only play with friends because I convinced myself it was a “social activity”. Turns out, months later I’m playing all hours of the night, irritable, not getting things done, and telling myself every single night that I don’t want to do it again tomorrow. 

Peeps, I need some fuggin’ help! My own personal feeling? I know I need to quit, but I don’t want to because I’m having “fun.” I’m reaching out because I know I need advice from people who have felt the same way I do. 

In the end, I simply just want to quit, and enjoy my real self. Enjoy life.

Anything helps, thank you so much :)"

We would talk like literally 24/7 I would visit her every chance I get and she doesnt have a license yet so it's not her choice whether she can recently her parents found out about us and got a little mad she said that it doesn't matter and we can still be together a few days passed and she just randomly came out and said that she needs a 6 month break and the break would mean we have to be friends ontop of that she has told me she doesnt know for sure what she will want in 6 months because she doesnt know what she wants now meaning me or not she has told me that there's nothing wrong with me and that it's just school and family is too much right now I told her i would wait 6 months as friends but I'm feeling stressed almost every day and its not even been a week I keep thinking to myself what if i wait and she doesnt really want me in the end she keeps saying she needs me as a friend for now because she cant let go of me and I'm the type of guy that would never hurt her so it's hard for me to let go my question is what do you guys think i should do and what do you think she wants keep in mind she says she doesnt know what she wants I saw her 2 days ago and she didn't want to kiss me or hold me we hugged and I wiped away her tears and thats all we still talk alot but

I know a big problem is my total lack of confidence most of the time, but it feels like I just don't have ""it"".

I have nicked quite a few pads and a couple ears, and I feel awful every time. I am working under a woman right now who has been grooming for 23 years and she expects me to keep up with her but it's been a struggle so far.

nd,"Nearly a year ago, one of my closest friends was killed at a young age in a brutal motorcycle accident. It wasn’t his fault. I get so angry because I don’t think he realized how much he meant to me. I’ve struggled making friends and him and I just clicked at work. We had the best times and it really made me look forward to being there. I couldn’t attend his funeral because I had to get a major operation done and I was stuck in the hospital not far from where he died. Local news posted the story on Facebook and all of the hateful comments saying how stupid he was makes me so angry. Since his death my life has been a downward spiral. Physically I’m not able to do much because of my condition, I had to put my dream of being a pilot on hold, the FAA is fighting to take my medical certificate away from me which is needed for flight, I can’t work, I’m just stuck in my house unable to do anything except when I have physical therapy and class, and I’m about to get my 5th operation in under a year. My chronic pain and medications with awful side effects don’t help. I feel like this all started when he passed so I’m hoping by telling someone this will give me closure and may help turn my life around.

nd,"So, My wife and I are purchasing our first house. We got pre-approval from two Banks; the first was through Charles Schwab who use Quicken Loans as their originator, and the second was Chase Mortgage. Quicken Loans has a $750 flat fee through Schwab for all costs of the loan.

When my wife and went to chase, they told us that as first time home buyers, we would be eligible for almost $3K in credits based on my income and where we were planning on buying.

So, based on the estimates, Chase would be a better option for us since the total closing costs less the credits would be more or less lower than the costs of the Quicken Loan's loan. Plus, we get the benefit of having a physical bank with real people to get in touch with.

A few months later, we find a house and the sellers accept our offer. I call up my Chase Mortgage guy and he says the house qualifies me for the First Time Home buyers Grants, meaning we will use Chase over Quicken.

Fast forward a month, we get our loan disclosure. Upon looking, I see we did not get the FTHB Grants. Apparently, when my Mortgage guy looked it up, his system was not fully updated or something, and it turns out my new house in not in a qualified area for these FTHB grants, which means I get stuck with the full amount of closing costs. In essence, I could have gone with Quicken Loans and just paid the $750, but now I am stuck with Chase and the extra costs.

Close on the house is EOM, which leaves me little wiggle room or leverage. Do I have an recourse here, or is this just a lesson learned in trusting big banks?"

nd,"I'm just wondering if HSV-2 can break out on your lips.

I made the dumb decision to have unprotected sex a few years back with my current partner. After a few weeks I had a terrible outbreak, and after 3 different doctors, the last one finally came back with a diagnosis after a swap, HSV-2. Thankfully I've had like maybe 2 very minor reoccurrences, nothing significant or very noticeable.

All of a sudden this weekend I woke up to a bunch of small dots right on the middle of the my top lip, and it was swollen. They eventually turned into blisters, and are scabbing over now. Lip is still swollen.

Here's a pic http://imgur.com/mqeN0lO

I'm in a relationship of 4 years now, and my partner has never showed any signs of either genital or oral herpes, but I can only assume I contracted the virus (or viruses) from them as the first outbreak occured just weeks after sex, and I've been with no one else.

Should I go get this tested or just leave it be? I'm not sure if I should do anything or if this is just life now.

Also wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and if they had both types."

There are comments I left years ago that I'm still getting notifications about, because people are responding to the same thing I'm responding to. I don't think most people care that someone else commented on the same thing. It would be the equivalent of liking a post on Facebook, and Facebook notifies you every single time someone else likes that same post. It's stupid and pointless, and so I just turn off the whole damn thing, even though it probably makes me look like an elitist dick when I seem to be ignoring someone responding to a comment I left on their content."

Now I'm unsure if we need a full new toilet or if we need the ""ring thing"" under it or both.
I have pictures of the toilet paper next to the base, I just need to upload them.

Any help would be super appreciated, we are ready to whatever.  :)"

nd,"Forgot to put SPOILERS in the title, so keep in mind that this post will reveal spoilers.

So we get a glimpse of Baam's true powers, and they seemed to be themed black ( taking into consideration that he used the thorn's powers which were red). What I found  interesting are the patterns on Baam's new attack, ""Black Winged Butterfly Attack"" ( https://imgur.com/a/rwm4TKv )which at first I thought shared the same patterns with the FUG symbol, and I still hold that opinion, it's just that they also look very similar to Jahad's 3 eyes. This makes me go back to one of my older posts ( https://redd.it/7twjye ) where I discussed the idea that Jahad, V. and Baam are related due to different reasons.

 Considering the fact that Baam's new power looks so similar to FUG's symbol, and Jahad's  eyes ,it is safe to assume that he inherited that power from his father (V.) who created FUG. If V's powers, themes or symbols look so similar  to Jahad's 3 eyed symbol, there must be a connection between them.

I know that the eyes don't look exactly the same, but to think that two characters that are so mysterious are proven to have more and more things in common just makes it too big of a coincidence. I believe that Jahad and V. had a greater connection on the outside, with V. maybe being the one with a better background and Jahad trying to emulate that in the tower, by becoming a king."

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad--and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

------

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**
Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** 
A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** 
A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Morning from Scotland!

This morning, a little story about my life (forgive my self-centred approach to today's check-in!):

When I graduated from University and landed my first job in programming, I walked into the office and was in awe of the skills of those around me. Everyone worked so differently from me, and to me it seemed like everyone else was just doing it better. I suffered from this [Impostor Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) - the feeling of not belonging, of being a fraud - for several years, until I gradually came to the realization that whilst everyone does things differently, everyone has their own strengths too. I realized that what I did was valuable too (even if it was a little rusty!), and that sharing my own techniques and learning from others was more valuable than trying to go it alone and/or copy everyone else.

Everyone's approach to the sober journey is different, and everyone will handle it slightly differently. You should never beat yourself up for ""not doing sobriety properly""! Everyone has their own resources that they use to help themselves through - for me, this sub has been completely invaluable, and I'm super happy to be contributing back to it in my own little way.

What are **your** sober resources, or techniques?

I will not drink with you all today! Have a great Wednesday!"

nd,"Hi everyone, I’m currently a 21 year old college student living not on the lease with three other people in their three bedroom apartment. My manager at work has been promising me more hours but continually isn’t scheduling me them. My roommates have been really considerate and understanding about me not always being able to pay them on time, but the semester just ended and two of them are moving out soon as the lease is almost over and I really need to pay them back. Anything helps if anyone feels so kind. I have paypal, venmo, and cash app and can provide identity verification/last few pay stubs and screenshots of messages with my roommates also. I can pay back with interest if anyone is willing to loan a larger amount I’d be more than happy to work something out. I posted in r/borrow/ already but haven’t gotten any responses yet. 
Thank you so much for reading."

It primarily revolves around washing after using the restroom. I think it stems from not knowing what is clean, or at least clean enough. 

I was taught to wash my hands after using the restroom, which I think is a generally accepted good, sanitary practice. I'm not entirely sure what the source of the germs is that necessitates washing my hands. I'm assuming it would primarily come from excreting urine and feces, so I generally consider my whole pelvic region as dirty. Also, I consider anything it touches as dirty, which also propagates that dirtiness. For example, the dirtiness of my pelvis gets transferred to my underwear, which transfers to my legs if I pull my pants down to sit on a toilet, so I can't even touch my legs without feeling the need to wash my hands.

I realize that this is extreme, but I'm not sure how to fix it. I'm not hyper-sanitary in a lot of other areas. I just thought about this area and became paranoid about it. I'm not even specifically worried about anything other than maybe being slightly more prone to get sick. I just don't want to be ""dirty"". 

I want to be less paranoid about this, but I don't want to go too far and try to drag myself to ditch all hygiene until I'm ok with being filthy. For those of you that deal with or have dealt with something similar, how did you handle it? What has helped you overcome it?

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this."

My plan is currently to show up and have taken a generic cialis the day before so I can keep it hard lol. 

I've always had a fantasy of participating in a gangbang and this is the first real opportunity I've come across. Plus the woman is an absolute smoke show so I'm hoping everything works out well so I can get my girlfriend involved (open Relationship)

nd,"When I was in school I adored my poetry class. Not that we had a Robin Williams in 'Dead Poets Society' type teacher or anything but we had a teacher who was clearly interested in the poets he taught us about and taught us how to think critically about what we're reading and most importantly to think about the cultural context of the poet and the time in which he lived.

The problem is that some 15 years later I just can't get into poetry again. Reading poems in isolation gives me nothing - I just get nothing out of it. I need to know why the poet is writing it. I can't interpret it without context.

Do you know any poetry podcasts that go into detail about poems and poets like this? Perhaps I'll have to make my own podcast about it so!!"

For the most part we used large pots on propane stoves, and we had a couple incidents with things burning after getting turned up a touch too high.

nd,"I have two friends, Kyler and Adam. I've known Adam for about 11 years and he is one of my best friends, we met when we were both in 2nd grade and have been very close since. We've never really had any huge disputes of any kind outside of minor arguments here and there as friends do. Although about 2 years ago Adam gradually started treating me differently. It began as small irritating issues that I was able to look past but then evolved into him blowing me off when we had plans, not really caring about how I was feeling, and in general just being selfish and inconsiderate. It continued getting worse until I had had enough. I stopped talking to him in December of 2016. Kyler, another very close friend of mine as well as my roommate who I've know for about 5 years did his best to comfort me through it all, as it was taking quite an emotional toll on me. As things progressed, Kyler essentially started to hate adam. I mean understandably as I was very angry at the time as well. Around May of 2017 Adam had started trying to contact me again attempting to apologize and make amends. We met a handful of times to talk about the situation. He explained to me that family issues and problems with mental health caused him to push a lot of people in his life away. Although I was still upset from the way he had treated me I was able to understand from personal experience where he was coming from. Part way through June I felt ready to try and forgive him. It took a little bit of time but eventually things returned to normal. Kyler however was not ready to forgive him. He has been very vocal about his disdain for Adam and refuses to conversate with him since. When trying to talk with kyler about moving on like I have, he tells me he doesnt think he will be able to for a very long time. I tell him that I've moved on because I understand what Adam was going through, he says he that he understands as well but the fact that it happened is too much for him to forgive. I see where Kyler is coming from in his anger but it's becoming too much to handle with him verbally attacking Adam at many points when I have had him at our apartment and just acting unprofessional making Adam feel uncomfortable with visiting. I Just need some advice on how to handle the situation because I'd like for Kyler to be able to move on so we can all three be friends but everything I've tried has failed."

Woke up with a **clear conscience**. Don't get me wrong, I ain't perfect, but without PMO, my mornings feel better. 

**Super Powers**, call it what you want, are real. I feel bigger wherever I go. Seems related to spunk storage. If anyone wants to explain that, I'm all ears. 

Today I met with a pastor, a college professor, and a corporate lawyer to discuss the church's role in climate care. I would never have had the nerve, as a 20 year addict, to be there, much less open my mouth. I was invited, and did a lot of the talking.

**Pumped iron**, doing more hiking. Now if I can only limit the calories!

I see a woman \(or tree shaped like one\), **I lust**. Yesterday this girl made me almost die. My heart was pounding, I was full of fear, anxiety, and expectation.

Sometimes I get hostility. One housemate is annoyed by everything I do, and it coincides with hard mode.

There are bad days. This waitress I met a couple weeks ago was finally working again but was **ice cold toward me**.

The lesson I guess I'm learning is not to be swayed by what people **seem** to think o f me.

Soooo i have no friends, no social, nothing. Nothing but my own thoughts and way too much Internet to keep my company. And that's not fun, my thoughts suck, they suck big time. I want to talk to people who aren't my own thoughts.

I live in England, more specifically Birmingham, so if you live around that area then hit me up, become my best friend and be trapped with me forever. If not, if you live somewhere else, then that's fine too, just as long as you speak English.

Interests... Interests... I like movies and TV because I'm super original and not boring. Although haven't really watched a lot since my laptop broke. See? Even my laptop doesn't want to be my friend. I have an xbox one, soooo Idk, we could play games, or we could say we'll play games, add each other and then never recognise each others existence forever? I like comics and stuff i suppose, reading sucks though so I'm too lazy to read them, but I try to.

This is too long. And weird. It's 2:39am give me a break. If you want to know other stuff then you'll have to ask me. Don't be boring though. Talk to me about similar interests or if not, talk to me about the universe and shit. The universe is cool.

nd,"Yeah, after a while PMO just isn't part of my life.  It's great.  I'm no worried about relapsing, although I'm ever-vigilant and know that I can't peek or dabble.

I haven't had a single moment of PMO in 500 days.  Not once.  Not for a second.  I do have sex pretty regularly, but believe me when I say that makes NoFap HARDER and not EASIER.  The Chaser is a bitch.

I have completely cured severe PIED.  That was 100% my goal.  As for the downside, I'm now dealing with some prostate issues as well as PE.  I'm expecting both of those to get better around the 2-4 year mark.  Yes, fucking years.  PMO is a bitch that way.

You really can break free from this; and it's really great when you do.  For everyone struggling and working on this:  I was there too, and if I can succeed you can too.  It took me 6 years to get this streak.

Any questions?"

nd,"It was a stormy night. The thunder was very loud and it was a very gloomy day. This type of weather was very unusual for the city I was living in. I was in an apartment complex that had good rent deals. I was located on the 8th floor. The room number was 812. I was watching the last episode of the first season of 13 Reasons Why. It was getting very interesting until the TV turned off. I was angry at first. But then, I heard a noise within the bathroom. I was a bit nervous now. It was like a growl. I walked steadily into the bathroom to see nothing except a knocked over shampoo bottle and a slightly opened window. I didn’t think much of it and placed the bottle back on the marble shelf. 

Later, I was on my couch using Snapchat and talking to my friends. I was talking to my girlfriend until I heard the same noise again. This time it came from the bedroom. I stayed as quiet at possible in-order to not be noticed and be found by whatever made that noise. Eventually, I heard something crawl out of my room through the window next to my twin-sized bed. Once I didn’t hear anymore noises for the next 5 minutes, I took my personal belongings and raced out of the apartment room. After walking a bit in the corridor. I stopped running and walked a longs way. I was out of breath due to my poor stamina. The room next to me was 856. The walk to the elevator was long. This was because the elevator was next to 899 and not 801. The space between each room was longer than most apartment complexes.

After 15 Seconds, I heard shuffling noises behind me and saw a figure that was tall and skinny. It was lanky. The figure had eyes piercing the long, dark corridor. It was very far away. It started  walking towards me. I started walking faster, trying get away from the figure. 

I was next to room 882 when the figure started running at me. I ran too. My stamina has never been the greatest, so I stopped running a few rooms ahead. I began to walk faster and faster after catching my breath. I finally made it to the elevator. I pressed the down button so I could leave the building. Then, something terrified me. The electronic screen on the frame of the elevator said “L”. That mean’t elevator was still rising up from the lobby. The figure was getting closer. It was only 15 feet away from me. I needed to distract the figure somehow. Luckily, something fell in another person’s room and the monster was lured away from my location.

The elevator finally reached the 8th floor. I got inside and pressed the circular button that had a L on it. I realized the door of the elevator wasn’t working properly. It kept opening and closing but not closing all the way. I then heard the loudest footsteps anybody can ever hear. They were coming in my direction. I frantically pressed the emergency shut door button repeatedly. The figure was a good 1 foot away from the elevator door before it finally closed...........it still managed to get his hand in. The elevator started moving down and the monster got its hand out of the elevator.

When I got to the lobby, I went to the front desk and reported the situation. They checked the camera footage and no one was there in the hallways and no audio files recorded “unusual” noises. They did call the police though. When they arrived, one of them asked me questions. 
I  remember one of the questions he asked me. He asked: “Do you take medication regularly?”. 


“Yes I do” I calmly responded

I'm asking because until I jiggled the tubes on my h100, I was seeing boot temps at 79-85c until it settled around at 82c on package. I jiggled the h100 tubes and I seen my temps nose dive to like 30, then finally settled around 39c.

nd,"What should I do? The creepy guy in my office continuously stands behind my cubicle and looks over my shoulder, checks my call log, sends me messages about things I’ve done wrong, and approaches my desk while I’m doing work. How is the best way to handle this??

He has done this since my first week on the job. He tells other employees stories about me, gloats  about me when I’m standing a few feet away, has corrected me on my assignments, even though I didn’t do them incorrectly....

The other day he came up to my desk while I was in the middle of multiple assignments to tell me about something I did wrong a month ago.

He has been asked politely to leave me alone, and has been informed that he makes me feel uncomfortable. This week he has decided to test his chances and has continued to camp out at my cubicle. 

I spoke with my main supervisor today thankfully. I’m just worried of how this will play out, I don’t wish for any negative effect for the creepy guy, but this isn’t fair to me. 
No one else in the office gives me this type of attention—and he doesn’t share it with anyone else.

nd,"So I ordered some CSG RC2 levers for my ninja 400 and they came in today. As I was looking up how to install them I came across al these horror stories about aftermarket brake levers causing the front brake to lock up and resulting in crashes. From what I was reading it seemed like there was a nipple type deal that needed to go into the lever and not be pushed in at all when the brake is not being applied. I thought I understood that, but once I removed my OEM brake lever I discovered there is a nipple form the master cylinder but it appears to be fully pressed in when the brake lever is not being pulled. Then when you apply the brake and gear the click the nipple is fully out, then release the brake and the lever pushes the nipple back in. Now I’m paranoid and just put the OEM lever back on and I’m confused. I’m planning on just returning the CSG levers and praying I didn’t fuck it up. Am I retarded?"
nd,"Alright sooo here goes.

I’m 35 male, I’ve been married to my wife who’s 34 female for just about 10 years. We have 3 kids, M 10, M 7, F 4.

We really have a pretty standard life, we both work good jobs, have a house in the burbs etc etc.

Relationship wise things have been good - we get into some disagreements over the usual stuff (dishes, trash, etc). But other than those things are pretty hunky dory.

Sex wise things are also good/fine. We aren’t crazy but monthly, and sometimes weekly we try to find some time to at least do something sexual. 

All things being equal, if  mood strikes and no one is around  I will indulge myself on pornhub for a bit... at some point last year I stumbled onto a site called Chaturbate which is a cam site and a bit more interactive than the usual video clip... so I tested the waters there a bit watching sometimes typing. 

In January I found myself with free time and as usual went for a spin through the online folks and found this one girl who piqued my interest.

As you may have guessed, cutting to the chase I’ve fallen for her, 6 months later we text daily, we’ve FaceTimed and basically chat whenever we both get the chance.

Thus this has now lead me here and to the realization that I am in love now with two women. 

I will not leave my wife for my other, but I also will not accept not having her in my life. Is it possible that I can have both?? Because that’s what I want, and that may sound selfish and it is but it’s how I feel.  IMO I’m in a grey area currently and I’m thinking about telling the wife about this situation before I end up crossing some lines with my other that would not be easy to come back from in my wife’s eyes if she’s keep in the dark...... 

Thoughts??? 


I’m scared to tell her for what might happen with my marriage, but If there’s even a slight chance she would be somewhat ok with what some might consider poly I think I have to bring all this up."

nd,"This if going to be a book. Sorry I’m advanced. A little back story first. I[18] was with a guy [19] for almost 2 years. Things were great at first, but then 6 months into our relationship, he admitted he had cheated on me while drunk with a girl (whom he introduced me to before he admitted this). I thought about t and made the decision to stay. To my knowledge, that was the only time he did. 

Fast forward a bit, he was a heavy pot smoker. I was not. He spent a lot of his money on it and it bothered me because it got to the point that it was all he eventually wanted to do. He didn’t go to school and he worked at a minimum wage job. Still lived with his parents. Smoked all day and slept. We went out and did things but not a lot. 

He didn’t like any of my guy friends or female friends. I went to senior week and he was mad at me the whole time. He came down to where we were staying without telling me and told me to hang with him and not his friends. I told him no and he went home and threatened to break up with me. He didn’t come to any of my school or family functions. He never came to my house, I always went to his place. 

I eventually got into college and he told me it wasn’t going to work at first. Even though my college wasn’t even an hour from home. My first semester starts and he visits me once. Because he “doesn’t have the money”.

He always threatened to kill himself (I actually picked him up from the hospital because the police heard and they took him there) and he smoked a lot and he told me I needed professional help. He wouldn’t sit down and have a serious conversation with me. He would laugh and tell me I’m being ridiculous. He hated ALL of my friends, especially my guy friends. He didn’t trust me even though I never gave him a reason not to. 

Fast forward a bit more, I break up with him just after thanksgiving. I told him that I just didn’t think I was in love with him any more, but that I love him. It takes me about 3 months to actually break up with him because he kept threatening to kill himself or he’d call me multiple times a day until I’d answer. He’d call my mom and talk to her about me. 

Not all of the relationship was bad. There were some very good parts. We would go hiking, watch lots of movies, we’d go on walks. He made me laugh and I know he genuinely cared about me. But I haven’t talked to him in like 3 months and I miss him terribly. The thought of him with somebody else feels like somebody is punching a hole in my chest. I want to talk to him but I feel as if that’s a bad idea. I can’t tell if I miss him, or who he used to be, or the idea of the relationship. The last time I spoke to him, he told me that he finally understood why I broke up with him, that I was ready to grow and he wasn’t and he didn’t treat me like I deserved. Which was right. So part of me believes he changed so that part of me wants to go back. Any advice??"
nd,"I answered. It didn’t seem like breadcrumbs, we were talking about a new song from an artist we both like. Then when the convo was dying down he starts to apologize and is saying how he’s coming to terms with his decision. 

Now I can’t stop thinking about him and what he meant when he said “I realize I may never have you back and may never be friends with you” 

Is he coming to terms that it’s never going to happen again or does he want me back? I don’t even know which I’d want, I’m just so confused.

Why are people so selfish."

I will be replacing springs at all 4 corners in 1-1/2 weeks, but I'm wondering if I should replace the sway-bar links while I'm in there.  The differing height (1 inch or so, not huge) left-to-right means that sway-bar (and links) is always loaded.

Note, the links are Moog brand that I replaced last year (about 4k miles per year).  I'm just wondering how long the end link bearings would hold up to extra use."

I’ll also say it was only 5 days inbetween my 2nd and 3rd trip. I haven’t felt normal since like every single day all day that’s all I can think about. And even if I’m not directly thinking about it i can still feel it. Sometimes I’ll get really bad headaches like there’s pressure and it’s warm, life itself seems so different and nothing at all seems to be the same. It’s almost like everything is grey with no vibes.

Basically, during May, my eyes get super itchy (zombie red) sometimes the ducts, and probably due to constant washing the surrounding area gets dry and gives me a burning sensation. If by luck it is not super itchy, it gets leaky and that adds to more burning. I have tried, Loratadine (10mg), Zyrtec (10 gm) and Zyzal (5 mg), not all at once of course, nothing worked. I never had it 3-4 years ago and then suddenly I'm allergic.

If anyone of you are going through this exact situation or something similar, I would really appreciate your input. Thanks!"
nd,"Im confused, and I feel okay that I cheated, 
Let me explain. 

Me and my boyfriend; have been dating for a year and few months but we have been living together for a year (yes we moved in after a few months of dating) 

Me and the guy I cheated with; my ex boyfriend, the guy who took my virginity and my very first boyfriend. I hated him sometimes. He was the obsessed ex boyfriend. 
 
before it happened ; I tried to break up with my boyfriend a couple of times, I explained everything to him, that i wasn’t attracted anymore and that he has showed his true colors and I don’t like them, I know that we moved in together too quickly. 
He said he would kill himself!!! If I leave, he cried to me and tried to hurt himself. I panicked because of course I care about him and I stayed. But I told him to not hug me, or kiss me, because I don’t want to be with him but I’m willing to see if he changes ( he said he would, but didn’t) 
Just because I care doesn’t mean I want to be with him, I don’t, and he knows it, but if I try to leave, he will hurt himself, I feel trapped. 

How it happened; my mom is close with my ex’s family. We were at a family party and he was there, he took me home after and we stayed in the car talking and ended up making out. 
We exchanged numbers again and we started texting, after a little bit, I went to his house and we had sex. 

While it happened; I felt no shame but I couldn’t stop thinking about my boyfriend, how I wish he would just let me leave and how wrong I feel in a way that I’m disrespecting him and that’s the only thing that really sucked. But I also enjoyed my time with my ex, it was nice. 

After; I went home, showered and changed and acted like nothing happen. We’re still sleeping at the end of the bed, he’s on one end and I’m on mine, while we’re on our phone. Actually, he’s next to me right now, and yet... doesn’t realize what I’m typing.

I wish I could run away, but I know hell hurt himself, and my ex? I don’t want anything serious with him. I don’t even want to see him again even though he’s constantly texting me again. 
I just want to disappear, feeling trapped with two people I don’t want to be around with because they make me feel like they are taking every single breath out of me. 

There, off my chest, finally."

nd,"I'm sure you have heard this advice from at least one person in your life. You'll find someone when you're not looking. The ""right one"" will just show up in your life, and it will all work out in the end.   I'm sure whoever says this means good, but for some people this is not only terrible advice, but also a giant lie.

The truth is, yes some people will find love when they're not looking but that's because they already possess qualities about themselves that makes others attracted to them.  They're already good looking, they have a lot of friends, they're not shy or have social anxiety around the opposite sex, and they're fun to be around.  Of course they're going to buy into the ""you'll find someone when you're not looking"" advice because they never had to truly work for love, it simply showed up in their life. 

But imagine telling a 20 year old overweight shy and quiet guy who has no friends and sits in his room all day jacking off to porn that he will find someone when he's not looking, don't worry it will all work out in the end. That's the biggest bullshit advice you could ever give to him!  He will never find anybody if he listens to that advice. He will make no self\-improvements, and will probably be 25 years old and in the same shoes he was 5 years ago.

The truth is, if you want to find someone, then you have to put yourself out there. You have to learn how to socialize with people, not just people of the opposite sex, but people of the same sex. Go out and make friends, practice talking to people. If you're an average looking guy or even a below average looking guy, it's very rare for a woman to come and approach you, right?    That's why it's very important you learn how to make yourself noticeable.  Secondly, you also have to be willing to go out to places to meet people, you're not going to make friends, certainly not a boyfriend/girlfriend by sitting in your room all day.   I mean you can try Tinder or Bumble but that place is notorious for average looking or below average looking guys."
nd,"Hello everybody,

I've been a long time lurker on reddit, but this is the first time I've ever been compelled to post something. 

I'm a 25 year old male and having a hard time finding my purpose in the world. Nothing excites me and nothing makes me excited to wake up in the morning.

I've lived on my own since I was 17 years old and feel I have a leg up on people my age when it comes to the real world and having to monitor my finances. I'm blessed to have found jobs (not careers) that pay me a decent enough salary to be able to pay my rent and necessities month after month. All in all, I'd say I have a life that many people would probably be happy to have.

My dilemma is that I don't know what I want to do in this life and it scares me. I have a wild imagination that shows me rich and retired on a beach somewhere. The reality is that I change what I want to do in life all the time. I don't think I've ever worked a job that's ever made me feel satisfied and I don't know what would. I was asked the other day by a colleague what I'm good at. I stared at him for 30 second and I couldn't come up with an answer. 

I spent 6th grade through senior year of high school cooped up in my parents house playing video games to hide from everyday life and constant struggles. I barely got passed high school with a 2.5 GPA. Took some classes in college but changed my major 7,8 times, wasting money with no clear sight of what I wanted to do with my life. My girlfriend of 2 years just broke up with me because she felt that I was unstable and that I wouldn't be able to take care of us (which I don't disagree with).

I've had 4 different jobs in the last 3 years and none of them fulfilled me at all. Everyday I wake up I ask myself if my purpose in life is to work a job Mon-Fri for the rest of my life because that's not a world I want to live in. I have bad ADHD (and don't take medicine) and feel like my organization skills are so poor that it hinders my ability to perform in any job I get hired for.

I don't have any real hobbies and there's nothing that gets me excited anymore. I play video games on the computer, go to the gym 6x a week and talk to the few friends I have in this life from time to time. Yet I don't feel like I'm getting as much out of life as I want to. I'll take 100% blame for my actions though as I haven't done anything to fix it.

I don't know if the above sounds like depression or a funk. I've never been diagnosed with depression nor do I have suicidal thoughts. I don't expect anybody to give me any ideas on how to fix this or really even know what to say. I just needed to vent a little bit as I don't have many people to talk to these days. I apologize if my thoughts are all over the place and hard to understand. I've never been the best as formulating stories

tl;dr: 25 y/o and not finding any fulfillment in life. Not sure if I'm bored with life and should be doing more or if I'm where I need to be."

ultrasound: ""heterogeneous thyroid goiter and 1.2 cm right nodule - no biopsy needed at this time, repeat sono in one year""

TSH: 27.86 - high
T3 (free): 2.6 - lower end of normal
T4 (free): 0.67 - low
THYROID PEROXIDASE AB 29 (high)
THYROGLOBULIN AB 799 (high)

Symptoms, none that I can really pinpoint, though I'm admittedly not the best at paying attention to cues with my body. I’ve been vegan for over 11 years and don’t really eat a ton of gluten rich foods already so unsure of the specific linkage of diet to all this.

EDIT: Here's the email I sent to my career board, hopefully they handle it. Including this here as it includes details of the ridiculousness of this company.

""""""
Hi, I came across a company called ""goaloop"" that is currently ""recruiting"" interns. I sent my resume and the next morning I was surprised to see a quick response, asking me to complete a questionnaire before an interview. 

I can forward you the emails if necessary. The questionnaire was a 6 page long Google Survey asking the interviewee to make an account and use tons of features on their website, which probably took me an hour to get all the way through since there was so many tasks. They marketed this as getting to know the website (which was a bit odd, but a stretch to say sketchy since you should how your product works if you're interning there).

I get a response back (an automated one nonetheless.....now a bit suspicious but still hopeful) that said there was a ""small"" pool of candidates for the interviews and they couldn't offer an interview until 2019......yes,2019. Really? Yes, really, 20fucking19. 

At this point, my curiosity led me to searching their company on glassdoor, at which I saw people complained of the very same thing as me---interviews held a year from the application date and essentially being ghosted. 

PLEASE remove goaloop from Handshake. They're harvesting off college students to beta test their idiotic mess they call a website (it's very slow and buggy) to boost their number of active users. No wonder they were willing to send me an interview request so quickly, their developers can't even make a responsive website 
Very shady and unethical.

nd,"Hi everyone. I own two of these amazing dogs but I've been involved in a little bit of a facebook fight recently. Not sure who is right/wrong but I thought I'd share it in order to gauge opinions. 

There is a 'Puppies for sale' facebook page in the city I live, and I'm a member. (I'm a dog lover, of course I'm a member)
Any-who; a 'Breeder' posted an add recently for her ACD's claimed her new lot of pups were purebred ACD, but I could tell by the easy to identify signs that they were Stumpy Tailed Cattle dogs. (No tan markings, some had tails, one didn't) 

I asked her if She was sure they were ACD's or had it been an autocorrect mistake. She told me that they were true ACD's. 
I asked for papers to make sure, She said that she couldn't provide and why was I asking for them. 
I then told her the difference between the breeds and could there possibly have been a mistake in her wording (again) or that there was a lineage intruder (!) of the Stumpy variety. 

Then, She decided that I was nothing but swear words - that was when her sister (same last name) came into it and started abusing me as well. 

Safe to say that the admins have been contacted and it's now in their hands.

Does anyone else want to defend their breed? I mean, I love ALL DOGS. Don't get me wrong! And I would adopt a pup/dog like THAT from a shelter/pound if it fit with my family."

* Alliance also has Jaina, who I believe is the most powerful mage alive right now. And she fucking **hates** the Horde.

* Alliance has Draenai, and we've seen the advanced capabilities of their space crafts and war machines on Argus.

* Horde has the sunwell, AND now they also have the nightwell. 

* Horde also has the blight, which while being a disgusting chemical weapon, is very effective.

* Horde has Sylvanas, who can apparently resurrect the dead of **both sides** on the battlefield, essentially meaning she has an infinite army.

* Horde has Gallywix, who has a stupid amount of gold. He could afford to buy even larger armies for the Horde. We've also seen numerous occasions of nuclear bombs that goblins have built. I won't count this as a point for the Horde tho, since I'm pretty sure Gnomes could build those too.


I don't know how powerful Malfurion actually is, but if the Horde could take him out, I'd say Alliance don't have much else going for them other than an incredibly powerful unstable mage.

I'd love more input from someone who is more knowledgeable about the lore.

nd,"Hello everyone!

I'm a college student at home from break. I'm trying to make money doing commissions, but I'm still waiting for things to pick up steam. I'd buy the game myself, but I'm the typical broke kid who doesn't want to ask her parents who are paying my tuition to buy her a little computer game. I usually just play Stardew Valley or 80 Days, but I'm starting to get bored of those games, and wouldn't mind something new.

I used to play Plague Inc. on my phone ages ago. I hear that the steam version is a lot more interesting and updated, and has a multiplayer mode, which is great because my boyfriend \(who's currently 80 miles away, and soon will be nearly 1000 miles away\) wants to play it with me! We could call each other and have fun playing the game together! He's probably going to buy the game tonight, if he can scrape up the money. 

The game is actually on sale on humble bundle for about 2 more days, and I would really appreciate it if someone got it for me. It's 6 dollars currently, and is usually 15, so that's why I'm asking now.

I know that this is such a trivial request, but I thought that I'd ask it here! People are so nice here, and I've tried my best to be nice as well, so maybe my little wish will come true.

nd,"I grew up in an interracial family. My father Indo-Fijian with South Asian ancestry, and a Catholic mother with European ancestry.
My father had an arranged marriage when he was found after he left the Army and it quickly turned sour a year after my older brother was born. His mother had been poisoning my father and he found out during a super bowl party with my uncles.

His wife had a letter in Arabic or Hindi which my father could not read and it was instructions from her grandfather on how to poison my father. He had been feeling extremely ill at that time as well and quickly blew up on her and left her. They ended up having legal battles for a few years and once the court made their decision to have her raise him until the age of 12 and then relinquish all guardianship of him to my father, she took him to Fiji and changed his name.

Over time we had heard rumors and my dad became very hurt over the whole ordeal and never spoke of it much and hated them both, as a way to cope with the pain I would assume. When I was conceived, my parents had an Islamic ceremony and later planned to have a child. My dad became physically abusive and my mother went out with her friends and got pretty drunk. About a month ago, my mother had admitted to having sex with some random guy that day before she went out. She ended up getting jumped pretty badly by a group of women over drama her friend caused and was hospitalized. She then found out she was pregnant and given the timing she never assumed that man impregnated her. 

So I came out pretty light skinned and it always confused my family and his siblings would swear up and down I was not blood and caused a lot of horrible drama, even to this day over it as I was in line to inherit all of the families crap, which I didn't want in the first place, given my father was the eldest son.

Well fast forward all the drama 23 years and on my birthday my brother had got in contact with a cousin who went behind the family (apparently) and messaged my mom on Facebook. They planned a surprise meeting on my 23rd birthday and I somehow ended up figuring it out the night before because everything was just acting super freaking weird and I weaseled it out of my mother. We met and it was rather weird, even though we had the same interests. 6 months later I became curious about my genetic ancestry and took a 23andMe DNA test. 

When I received my results, I was shocked, to say the least. It was now stating I was 0% South Asian and Mostly White, Native American, and Iberian. I began to deny these results, even though I knew they were likely somewhat accurate. I had matches from my mother side and knew them personally so I knew they had gotten my sample and didn't mix it up.

Well after a few attempts at getting my half-brother to take the test, I gave up and decided to have my mom take a 23andMe, and got myself an Ancestry DNA kit. I was doing uber for the drunkies and ended up getting an email notification at 1 am stating my results were in and decided to take a look. Unfortunately, my suspicions were confirmed and I had a 1st cousin, who I did not know, and who was Mexican. I had kind of known since I saw my first results but a large part of me didn't want to believe it because I have spent my entire life believing I was something that I was not. 

I am just grateful my father passed away several years ago when I was 19 because this would have really hurt him, and I am pretty hurt myself. There is a load of things running through my mind. Unfortunately, my mother refuses to acknowledge this and the story of how my mother is, is another story on its own. 

It is just such a dramatic event in regards to my personal identity, especially when, I already grew up with severe identity issues over being a White, South Asian, and a Muslim man. It seems the story of my identity is never ended and although I don't expect, nor really want a relationship with my long lost father unless it happened organically, if he is alive. It would just be nice to satisfy my curiosity and finally make sense of my identity and put together the pieces of what makes me, me."

nd,"Hi. My apartment has metal studs which have complicated things before, so I wanted to see if there's anything I should know, beyond the usual, before attempting to do this. (It would also be my first outlet extension.)

It seems like it makes things super easy when the new outlet is almost directly opposite an old one, because the old outlet should be attached to a stud.

Normally, it looks like you'd position the outlet on the other side of the wall, on the other side of the stud, cut out the drywall, and, I guess it's not 100% clear. [There's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN4sxAmcRME) of a guy doing this where he drills through his wooden stud below the outlet and runs a length of romex through. But he has the entire wall cut out in order to accomplish this. As well, it's a little more complicated, I guess, to get a hole into a metal studs. But it seems there could even be a prefab hole already ready to go which I could use. (Maybe with a ""bushing"" to protect the wire?)

I'm wondering if I should just do this on the SAME side of the stud, and use one of those boxes that attach directly to drywall, and that would save me from needing to do a bunch of patching at the end?

Last wrinkle is that the new outlet is in a closet. (This whole thing is to power network equipment that I hide away in here.) I'm in the US (New York State) and it doesn't seem like there's any code issue with putting outlets in the closet. But it'd be coming into the closet from the side (pretty much near the middle of the depth) so my only concern was just that there might be something about distance from the back wall of the closet... Seemed unlikely if they actually can go in closets without issue, I guess.

Thank you!"
nd,"I can get anywhere from no sleep to 9 hrs on a weekday. I usually get 8 and a half hours of sleep normally. However, if I wake up to my alarm, it doesn’t matter how much sleep I got. I’m drained and can barely focus all day.

Many witty responses that I can learn and use in the real world. **Second**, their acting was great. Not over-the-top moments whatsoever during the screening, again something I can learn and apply it to the real world as well. **Third**, it was a comedy movie so I can watch the whole story lightheartedly without any complicated thoughts.


Any similar or better movies to Fired Up (2009)?


[EDIT] Okay you guys, it doesn't HAVE TO BE some kind of sports movie. Doesn't have to be cheerleader movie. As long as it has some witty lines, good acting, it will just be okay! For instance, I really liked ""This Is The End (2013)"" as well!"
nd,"This sub has been so informative and helpful so I thought I would share my experience.

My physical condition: I haven't slept through the night in over a year and wake up about 20-30 times a night on average. Had a sleep study done once and it was closer to 60. I have psoriatic arthritis and deal with depression. Other than that I'm in decent health for a almost 40yo male. haha

About 3 weeks ago I started using Bluebird Botanicals tincture in the 250mg bottle. My starting dose was about 4mg twice a day and I noticed a difference the second dose. I felt clearer, more focused and a little less pain. Fast forward to today and I'm taking 8mg twice a day. I'm almost pain free, I am in a very good mood all the time and I actually sleep now. I don't even use snooze on my alarm anymore! If it helps I take my second dose about an hour before I want to go to sleep and take a klonopin just before bed. I wouldn't say I sleep like a baby but I definitely wake up refreshed which is uncharted territory for me. 

I bought their 1,500mg bottle and plan to move to that once I finish the 250 bottle. I'll probably get to around 20mg/day and I think I'll be pretty set there. CBD has been a life saver. It's been a very long time since I have felt this good. For those on the fence about trying it I highly recommend it. Your experience may vary but I feel it's worth trying.

To the newcomers, my suggestion is to go with a brand that sends their products to a lab for testing. I like to know what I'm getting for my money and I feel that it makes a difference. 

To all those who felt helpless, like there seemed to be no end to the pain, suffering, depression and sleeplessness let me tell you. There is hope! Find a reputable brand, start small and be patient you'll be glad you did."
nd,"Long story short - I had a hospital stay several years ago. I was still in university and my parents were going to pay. I assumed they had it handled. Well, I assumed it had been handled because they said it had been. I bet there was a miscommunication between them.

I am going to pay the bills, but I would rather pay the hospital directly, they really helped me. Does it matter if I pay the hospital or the collection agency? 

Thanks! 

tl;dr : does it matter if I pay the hospital that the bill in collections is owed to instead of the collection agency?"

nd,"So when I was a senior in college I interned at my favorite publishing house in NYC \(a medium\-size company, not as huge as Penguin but still a big name\). Unfortunately, due to the nature of my program, I was interning while also working on campus and finishing my undergraduate degree with a full course load while also taking the first set of classes for my master's degree, while living 2 hours away by train from the city and working on campus. Between all of this, commuting 3 days a week into the city, and NJ Transit's weekly breakdowns and delays, I had to quit because I was not able to accomplish everything on my plate if I wanted to sleep more than 2 hours a night \(totally my fault for over\-scheduling myself but so it goes\).

Fast forward to a year later, I'm finishing my MA this month, and that same publishing company now has job openings in positions I'd be fully qualified for and suit my interests even more than my internship did \(a totally different department, as well\). Is it appropriate to apply to these jobs? Is it bad etiquette to now apply for a full time job at a place where I quit my internship? Can I keep my internship on my resume? How do I explain why I was there for such a short time? 

I'd appreciate any insight anyone can offer! Thanks!"

I've tried looking online for answers but I'm only finding people asking the same question and not many definitive ""my cat did this and was diagnosed with X"". There was one video on YouTube of a cat doing something similar with a comment saying it was related to heart disease but nothing else to confirm this. My vet also said it's a difficult thing to pin point, she suspected lower airway disease so we treated my cat for that but it didn't change the gulping.

First text after she got home she basically said ""yeah he didnt mean it and he said he's sorry it'll never happen again"" I was shocked, she'd die for her kids, that's not like her.

Then a few minutes later texted me and said I was never allowed around the kids again. I watch them every day (lived with them, raised them from birth basically. We fight a lot but she trusts me for anything)

A few hours later I get the following text that the boyfriend went after her.

Now shes not perfect .. she JUST finished a year old CPS investigation because the one time she tried amphetamines someone called on her immediately and she failed .. she had a year of drug tests and inhome inspections 3 times a weak and didn't fail a single one. In this year her ex husband cheated left and became a dope addict and she lost the 2500 sq ft 5 bedroom house and brand new car because of the financial loss. Not the best time for her.

This new guy has 3 other children and all of the mother's swear he had molested his daughters but couldn't prove it.

Like I said, she's not perfect .. at her job someone had given her some zanax and she accepted them .. Franky she's a little loose when it comes to that kind of stuff, but the hard drug thing had never really been a problem.

Anyways

Just yesterday I started crying in the auditorium with my best friend next to me and my boyfriend 2 seats behind me. My boyfriend doesn't know about my issues bc i don't want to scare him off (we've been dating for 3 months). I keep seeing him look at other girls and laugh with other girls who are skinnier and prettier than I am. Don't get the wrong idea about him, im just saying I'm jealous of other people. My bf is really a very sweet guy. I feel like there's no way out of this shit and I just feel so done right now. Any advice would be much appreciated, thank u if u read through all of this ❤"

So my plan is to quit my job completely and only work part time in the next few months in order to have more time to study. 

However, there are a few concerns relating to my job seeking: 

- Will recruiters find me lack of commitment when my experiences include working as a CS agent for 8months before quitting to be a QC for my current company which has been 1year n 10months since? 

- Is it a bad move to quit my job completely instead of keeping the job and asking to quit once I receive an offer? Will recruiters find it unimpressive of the candidate to be in an unemployment situation?"
nd,"Donald Trump is a Hoax, Only a Bit Gay and Jewish as well.

This is all we know about the guy other than his history in New York in the 70s and 80s, the “party years,” a history that places “Donald” in the midst of Jewish New York, but also “Gay Jewish New York.”

Trump’s companion, Roy Cohn, one of the most frightening characters out of American history, mob boss, phony commie hunter and someone who described himself as “straight” but who loved having sex with attractive young men.

Roy Cohn was a closeted, homophobic, middle-aged gay man also battling AIDS but who was a real-life Über-villain of America’s 20th century. “The polestar of human evil,” as one character describes him. “The worst human being who ever lived … the most evil, twisted, vicious bastard ever to snort coke at Studio 54.”

http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/04/frank-rich-roy-cohn-the-original-donald-trump.html

&gt;As for the “Jewish” charge, we are told that Trump converted to Judaism decades ago. It is one thing being a convert, another in keeping it secret. 

&gt;####Analysis by experts in counter-intelligence and “cover and deception” methodologies say there can be only one answer, Trump hides behind his “man’s man” front, hiding a highly insecure gay “fatboy” with impulse control issues.

&gt;The real assertion, we believe, is that Melania was bought into the US as a “beard” for gay Trump. 

&gt;Mob thugs working for Trump seized his laboratory reports and scared the hell out of an office filled with patients.  Our guys say Trump has “something.”  Is it AIDS?

&gt;This report just hit but the “robbery” was over a year ago.  Why now?  Is it because this is the week that a very meaty “Trump is gay” report hit VT and went viral, despite bans by Gargle and Fakebook?

&gt;It is getting hard to “not see.”  Yesterday, Rudi Giuliani, the ultimate hired gun, reputed mastermind, according to our sources, of 9/11, supposedly exposed Trump for paying off a porn queen, laundering the cash through alleged “lawyer,” Michael Cohen.

&gt;This, of course, came only 48 hours before Trump himself was “outed” for not just being a gay president but a “whiny, pissy little bitch” of a gay president.  The MSM was scared off from the story but VT’s sourcing hit so hard that Rudy was called in for “damage control.” 

&gt;Why do you think he has dumped so heavily on gays in the military?  Take a moment and check Rudy’s own history. 

&gt;#Remember When Rudy Giuliani Dressed Up in Drag and Let Donald Trump Grope His Fake Breasts?

nd,"I've just joined this so I'm not sure what I'm doing \(sorry if I fuck up\) 

In Feb 2015, I'd downloaded tinder and met this guy Phil. We agreed to meet up \- but he wanted me to bring a friend. So I did, my friend Cara. He brought his friend Justin. 

So we all went out for a 4 hour drive, had lots of fun, but the snag was I got along with Justin better. Phil and I met up for two nights after and nothing came of it. 

Sept 2015, I got tinder back after a couple of shitty dates and failed relationship and matched with Justin \[not intentionally, I knew he was familiar but it took a while\] long story short, we became friends with benefits which then led into a relationship. 

Nothing really changed, everything was the same \- for a while. He started being distant, I was hoping to hear how his day went, if he needed someone to talk to, just being a friend more than anything because he had crap going on. I waited 8hrs \- a few days on each reply, and shortly broke things off over text because I couldn't get a hold of him. We would always somehow end up back in contact. But the same things kept happening over and over again to the point I got tired of it, we would have had random meet ups, he'd tell me about the girls he was dating, trying to '...' and funny stories about when it wouldn't work. It hurt a little tbh. 

I stopped speaking to him again, because I felt myself getting more attached and I knew how it would end. So we both agreed it was going around in circles and we should just leave it at that. 

A week later he messaged me about a marvel reference I was trying to remember. Ever since then, he's been exactly what I wanted ages ago. Replying quickly, being attentive, coming up to mines for movies and such. 

But I'm absolutely terrified of getting hurt again \- if he's going to be the same way he was at the start and then gradually start to distance himself from me to the point I'm constantly wondering what I done wrong. 

This is probably a crappy post and if anyone reads it \- thank you. I'm just looking for advice on what I should do."
nd,"I used to play Scout a lot but didn't like using his default Scattergun that much. I would spend most of my time using the Force-A-Nature just because it seemed like the best option for hit and run attacks, with the power and knockback. It also helped with mobility given its extra jump trick. Now I use the gun sparingly and mostly using the Soda Popper because of its increased reload rate and no damage penalty (unlike the F.A.N.'s %10 damage penalty). They are pretty similar which is why I'm curious about which one people prefer. The general perception that I get is that the Force is more popular, since I don't really see people use the Popper in games.
Is the F.A.N. better with the knockback and the jump or the S.P. better with the reload speed and the lack of a damage nerf? I lean a little bit more towards the Popper because each gun has 2 shots and faster reloading is better, but its a small change."

nd,"I had this cat named Simba since around 2003. This happened in 2015. So Simba likes to jump on my dads lap and cry at him because he loves him. my dad fed him, cleaned out his litterbox and was his favorite human in my family. The day Simba died i remember him trying to jump on my dads lap and cry at him. And my dad was irritated at him and wanted to be left alone. And i felt sad for Simba because he was old and was just trying to love him. I thought about how nobody really loved Simba anymore and something told me he was gonna die. That day i was outside in my backyard simba was too and i saw a black snake a few feet away from him but i scared it off. We usually bring the cats in at night but simba was outside under the shed. He was crying we had to lift the shed to get him out. He was paralyzed and crying took him to the vet and they said he had a stroke or a heart attack and we put him down.  Other predictions have happened with me. Like my mom getting cancer and my uncle getting into a motorcycle accident. Its kinda creepy cause i dont know if im influencing the events to happen or if im like predicting them."

nd,"Hi All,

Recently my friend and I have been experiencing problems using Google Account to log into older iOS devices. Specifically, we are trying to log into an iPad Mini 4 LTE and my friend's device is an iPhone 5S. When attempting to log in, we both often get the loading Pokeball screen indefinitely quite often. However, sometimes it loads fine.

We have newer Android phones, but the Go Plus connectivity is so spotty for us that it's easier to just run on our very old iOS devices until now.

The account is definitely live as it has no problem logging into an Android phone. What's really strange is we also have no problem logging into a newer iOS device (specifically, we tested siPhone 7).

We created a PTC account to see if PTC would work on these devices, and the account logged in fine.

What we have tried:

* Cleared cache (via clearing Safari history) then logging in again by entering the account information again
* Restarting the App and Device
* Reinstalling the application


I can't seem to wrap my head around what's wrong. The only thing common between the two devices we can't log into is that they're relatively old.

Our sample size is small, so was hoping to hear anyone else's insight.

Thanks everyone"

nd,"Warning: Long.

I’m 30 year old male in Los Angeles and most of my friends are women, so of course I’m going to run into MLM at some point. This is the first time it’s actually affected a friendship. 

I’ve been friends with let’s call her “Lydia” for about a year now. One day she asks me for a ride (oh yea, none of my female friends drive) to this event that she’s attending with a friend. I oblige, and afterwards she tells me that it was amazing and that I should go with her next time. I ask what it was and she tells me that it was like a “life coach” seminar where they have different people speak and it’s just a motivational and encouraging experience. I figure what the hell, I’m a business owner, maybe I’ll find some use from it- so I go with her to the next one.

Immediately upon entering the event I knew something was up. Everyone is super nice and overly friendly. There are name-tags. I’m registered as Lydia’s “guest” and as such I’m not privy to everything that a “member” is. Turns out every member there has a “guest.”

I instantly began snap chatting my friends that I was in a cult and to use my last known location to find my body.

30 minutes into the seminar I was ready to blow my brains out. Every person who has spoke talks about how shitty their life was before they found X event. NO ONE talks about how X event changes them, just that it did. 

It gets worse. They start to talk about how they spent their life savings on X event and it paid off. They encourage you to max out your credit cards or take loans out to pay for X event. I’m dying inside. The last 30 minutes is preparing you for the fact that there is NO excuse not to join X event and that it benefits everybody even if you don’t think it will. 

After the event, recruiters come around and ask “guests” about their interest. I am firmly, deeply and aggressively assertive that I have zero interest in joining. This does not sit well with them. 

“This is for you then, because X event works best for people who think they have nothing to gain from it.”

I respond, “From a marketing standpoint, you have a remarkable product. It benefits everyone, there is no excuse not to do it, it’s incredibly expensive, and you get your customers to sell it for you. As a business owner I am impressed, but not interested.” 

My “sponsor” Lydia is upset that I am so callous towards the event. Fast forward two weeks later and she invites me over for tea. I’m the gayest straight guy this side of the car wash so of course I say yes. She has another male friend over and we exchange banter, then I learn that he is a member of X event. Fantastic.

I spend the next hour defending myself from not wanting to join- they are double teaming me. It gets to the point where I say “Listen, you guys are great but this X event has become your personality and you aren’t respecting that I have nothing to gain from it.”

“Oh but that’s where you’re wrong, you THINK you have nothing to gain but that’s the best reason to try it!”

I say, “Even now you’re not listening to what I’m saying. I’m sorry but I don’t want to speak about it anymore. There is no content to it to even speak about.”

I leave soon after and avoid Lydia’s texts and calls for 2 months. Every single week she sends me a copy and paste invite to X event. Every week. 

Unfortunately, Lydia lives in my neighborhood so it was only a matter of time before I run into her again. She’s crossing in front of my car at a crosswalk and we make eye contact. I knew there was no getting out of this. I have about 10 seconds to prepare my excuses. I fail.

She leans into my passenger window, “Hiii! How have you been? I haven’t heard back from you!”

“I got a new phone.”

“Is it a new number?”

“....No.”

I expect her to call me out and end our friendship on the spot. What happened instead blew my dick off.

“Do you want to be my guest at X event tomorrow?”

“I’m busy.”

“Okay, maybe next time!” 

Unfuckingreal."

nd,"Good morning you lovely ladies I owe you an update. When we left off my dickhead of a husband had not packed for a cross country moving happening in less than 24 hours. He decided at noon the day before the move to start packing. But he didn't really pack just moved shit from one pile to another. 

I did as I said I would and had myself and kiddo and the pups packed. He ended up calling his friend to help and between the two of them they got a decent amount done. He came to me and said he was so anxious about everything and he just couldn't start. 

This has been a common thing. He gets too overwhelmed and then just does nothing. Ive had anxiety my entire life. I am being followed by a cardiologist because the constant panic attacks and always living in fight/flight during my childhood has caused damage to my body. I'm doing well now but it's a precaution. I've dealt with anxiety for as long as I can remember and I know how hard it is to start something. I've been to therapy off and on and I guess what keeps me going is if I don't do it no one will. 

So it turned into me telling him what to do and helping pack with the understanding whatever we got done went with me and kiddos (including my pups because let's face it they are my babies) and he agreed. We got a decent amount packed and on a truck and have been at the new house a week. 

The place is amazing and I've been able to shop a bit and get new things for the bathroom and a new set of sheets. Little things but I'm actually able to decorate and pick out how I want my house to look. He agreed that he needs to be the one to go down and get the rest of the stuff (all his) and agreed to individual and couple therapy. Im sitting here sipping hot coffee with the kiddo playing outside in our yard while he picks up the rest of the old house.

I made it very clear I do it all alone and I need to know how he contributes positively to my life. He agreed to medication and he has a Dr appointment and a therapy appointment already scheduled and he did it on his own. I'm sure following through on moving with or without him was a nice kick in the pants to take action. 

I'm still cautious and not holding my breath but in our 12 years together this is the first time he's actually done something. I have 6 months marked on my calendar and if things have not drastically improved I will follow through with my plan I laid out for him. Thank you wonderful ladies for the encouragement and sharing your similar stories."

I will probably restore all the files, but it got me thinking: is that such a good idea? The reason that I got myself into this mess would be corrupted files, so if I were to restore the files that EaseUS finds on my hard drive, would that also recover Windows files that are corrupted?"

I rent from a commercial office in a high rise building. In the half decade that we have occupied the space we have received with out issue deliveries from UPS, Fedex, USPS, DHL, etc. Like any other business we also send out on a fairly regular basis outgoing packages in fairly small quantities.

Recently our landlord has changed their policy so that we cannot receive any deliveries to the building until after hours.

Last night my wife and I were co-oping in Blighttown. We play on PS4 if that matters. We both enjoy running around kicking the bloated pustules and watching blood spurt out. Except in DSR, the blood isn't red. It's a brackish, swampy-green color. It also doesn't seem to spray as high as the blood in the original release did.

This is one of those things I probably wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't delighted in doing it for nearly seven years now.

What changes have you noticed?"

Well,  last Friday I was driving a drunk, sick coworker home in their car and I got pulled over for an out brake light. I got a ticket for Driving Under Restraint and it's still tied to the DUI so the penalties are steep. I need to get my license back quickly so they hopefully dismiss the ticket.  
I got my license reinstated by getting non owners insurance and a notarized affidavit that I don't have a car for an interlock. Then I got my permit. Now I just need to take the driving test. Well, I found out that with a restricted license, I can only take it in a car with an interlock. So I'm in a tight spot of needing to find someone who will let me use their car for the test. I will schedule it whenever works for you, sooner better than later. It'll maybe be one hour. I have insurance, I'll be with an instructor, and you can probably even sit in the back. I'd be willing to pay $100. It would be extremely helpful. Thanks!  Edit: I'm 31 btw"
nd,"I know that this story is going to sound bullshit, but I’m not writing this to scare you guys. I’m trying to find other people who genuinely might know something about this because honestly, I’m stumped. And I need help.

This all started almost a year ago, in the summer of 2017. I had just became friends— and later in July, the partner of— this boy named Marco. I’m still dating him to this day, though I doubt that’s important.

I’ve had this unidentifiable “condition” of sorts since I was a kid that only got worse as my life progressed. I think I was about six years old; I would hear people call my name when I was alone. Sometimes, it would be a whisper right against my ear, and sometimes, a distant yell.

As I grew older, these false auditory cues turned into weird visual hallucinations, usually at night. I would make out shapes that didn’t exist, see wildfires and lightning in the distance, wait for animals to cross the street while I was driving only to have them disappear when I focused on them, things like that.

They always disappear after a split second. Sometimes, I’m left wondering if it was ever real (like the lightning), and sometimes, it’s so obvious that it can’t possibly happen that I don’t even question it (for example, I once saw a giant eyeball open up in the middle of the road).

I’ve been to two physicians and spoken with two therapists, and I never got a true answer. Three of the four said they were stumped after I told them I’ve never touched drugs, and one therapist blamed it on my sleep pattern despite the fact that I get around eight hours of sleep a night.

Looking back, I can see now that these hallucinations only started getting really severe when I met Marco around April 2017, though no part of me understands why.

Over that summer, there was a day that I spent the afternoon and evening with Marco. It was completely normal— we had Dairy Queen, played video games, and that’s it. When I went home, I was sitting in my car in the dark. That’s when I started hallucinating again.

There was this figure standing in the trees. Its limbs were elongated and its back was hunched to hell and back. If you’ve played Until Dawn, picture a wendigo’s body shape. It also had long, pointed fingers (and presumably, also long, pointed toes. I’ve never seen their feet before), empty eye sockets, a lack of hair, and a big smile with sharp, shark-like teeth. It didn’t have skin, instead looking like a shadow, but I don’t feel right calling it a “shadow-person” because it definitely wasn’t a “person”.

I get that this sounds straight out of a twelve year old’s creepypasta, but I’m not willing to present false information when I’m trying to figure out what these fuckers are.

Anyways, there were two things wrong about what I was seeing. One: it was way more disturbing and nightmarish than ANYTHING I’d ever seen. And two: no matter how long I stared, it never disappeared. It just kept staring at me. I rubbed my eyes to see if it would help, and it moved closer to my car. I flashed my high beams at it, and it dissipated before I made a mad-dash to my house.

Granted, I live in a very wooded area, so there are a lot of trees I could’ve mistaken for what I initially saw. But I started seeing them everywhere: the sides of roads, sitting on power lines, empty parks, my backyard. The point is, they were way more reoccurring than anything I’d ever seen.

It got to a point where I needed to tell someone. I felt like I was finally going crazy, and I just needed some kind of reassurance. Of course, that’s when I turned to Marco. I texted him that I was seeing these shadow people, to which he responded by drawing a very accurate picture despite my really vague description.

While he couldn’t see them, he said he could feel their overwhelming presence when they were nearby. He only knew what they looked like because his ex-boyfriend could see them, too.

They both call them “gristers”, though I’ve google image searched the name and typically find them having skin. Some pictures really do capture how I see them, though.

Have any of you had similar experiences with this?"

nd,"I was recently dog-sitting for a friend, and while snooping around his house I found his girlfriend's lingerie drawer.  Seeing the type of things that she was privately wearing for my buddy got me so turned on that I couldn't help but jerk off while smelling the crotch of her outfits and imagining her pussy and big tits. Then, I have no idea why I did it but instead of cumming in a tissue, I came in the crotch of one of her outfits.  

Now I feel terrible!  She and my buddy came home 2 days later and I did not tell them what I'd done.  I was/am very embarrassed.  My initial thought was that nobody would ever know, but now I'm worried that the next time she puts it on she will realize that the crotch is all crusty with my dried cum.  Do I admit to my buddy what I did and hope he doesn't get pissed, should I just hope that nobody notices, or hope that if she does notice maybe she thinks it was him or maybe she thinks it is her own juices from the last time she wore the outfit?  

Has anybody ever done anything fucked up or similar in their friends/families houses, and if so, how did it turn out? Do you live with regret for doing something like that to a friend?"

nd,"When I say xR I mean that the vast majority of the spells in the deck hold that cost. It's very cute and not competitively viable, but let me tell you, it absolutely wins games and [[earthquake]] for 6 on turn 3 wipes most boards.

The components:

1. Tron package including eggs, mountains to fill the lands
2. A metric shitton of [[Blaze]]+/++ spells (basically all of them except the worst ones)
3. Cut 4 blazes to jam [[Pyromancer's goggles]] for the spice
4. You are now able to say ""Blaze for 18"" in modern. Or ""Blaze for 6"" and subsequently ""Blaze for 9"". The fact that most of your spells double as removal makes it a tiny bit versatile when it needs to be, being able to burn a Mana dork t2 on the play isnt awful.

Bonus: you get to run [[banefire]] to blow out control players, 3-4 copies of [[Fall of the Titans]] to blow out a deaths shadow haymaker, etc, but season it to taste.

I'm not 100% sold on Blood Sun, but it could have a home here. I was already a little sketched out cutting my critical mass of blazes for the goggles, but after killing someone from full with one spell I was sold.

Yes, normal tron is better, but this is hotter. I played it on xmage and won plenty of hilarious games, but haven't taken it to FNM yet since picking up this admittedly very budget deck in paper (that also nets you some modern staples) Have fun!

EDIT: https://puu.sh/yBm0l.png

people are requesting the actual list, i couldn't remember it by heart so I found an old screenshot which gives you the idea. Goggles and fall of the Titans (and burn from withins) not pictured. I thought about trying to go with the most optimal blaze spells, but your mileage may vary. Like I said, season to taste."

I have spent days of researching this ""Company"". When I \(Googled\) them. All I found is unrealistic ""Testimonies"". Like all of them had the same format. Or same like testimony script? I clicked all the other links about them but those all felt like I was reading something that was typed by a robot. 

One of my friends said that since there is only positive links. That all the real and bad ones are in the shadows of the internet, like kicked to the side. Like they hired people who manipulate the internet to only show good links and promote the ""Company"". I remember when I used \(Fiverr\) for something to do with music, I saw that you could pay people like 5$ or more, and they could manipulate the internet, where they have bots that only promote the good. And when you \(Googled\) the only happy stuff came up on the first search. 

After more searching, like hours worth. I did find the real ones. It was pretty hard to find them. I will get to them later on. So why I am writing all this? I will explain. 

To protect the persons true name and identity. I will call them \(Jamie\) since it's a boys and girls name. 

Jamie is one of our family members. Now they are not part of my household family, such as sibling wise.

Jamie one day called me up. Now I do not hear from Jamie a lot, but we know each other well. And have each other on \(Facebook\). Now I can't recall word for word how our phone conversation went. But from what I can recall. It went along the lines like this.

Jamie \- HEY!  How are you?

Me \- I am normal I suppose. And you?

Jamie \- Cool! I am fantastic!

Me \- Oh. Why so?

Jamie \- I am glad you asked! I have a special surprise! 

Me \- Ah. What is it?

Jamie \- It is a surprise! I can't tell you now. But everyone knows I have a surprise, but I have to wait a few days before I can tell everyone, to build up suspense! 

Me \- Oh. Why can't you just tell me though? Like is it about that masters college you got into?

Jamie \- NO! Not yet! Okay! I will tell you! Do you ever feel tired and wishing for more money?

Me \- Uh. I guess? I mean, more money sounds nice. But I do not need tons to be happy. 

Jamie \- I started my own business! 

Me \- Wow really? How? You do not have any money.

Jamie \- Well if you stop being rude I will tell you how.

Me \- Oh, sorry.

Jamie \- I am starting a travel business! 

Me \- Oh?

Jamie \- And I want you to be part of my team!

Me \- But I already work a lot and going to the Army soon.

Jamie \- Yeah I know but the military is stupid. You are just throwing your life away!

Me \- \*Wow okay.\* Umm. So did you take out a loan and did you ask your parents to pay for it? How will you do the taxes and payroll and legal stuff?

Jamie \- It is all taken care of! The company already provides it! 

Me \- But I thought it was your company?

Jamie \- It is.

Me \- \*What?\* Umm... Okay, if I did want to be part of it, what would I need to do?

Jamie \- Well you need to pay 200$ and then 60$ to me monthly. And you cannot quit on me! You have to be dedicated to me and my team! I cannot have quitters! 

Me \- Uhh... Okay hold up. Who does the 200$ go to anyway? And to be honest why would I pay you or anyone to work?

Jamie \- You know? Why did I even tell you anyway?! I knew you would not be interested! 

Me \- Jamie calm down okay? I do not know why you are getting yourself worked up.

Jamie \- NO! Right now you are being negative and I don't need this!

\*Hangs up\*

Me \- \*Woah\*

Two weeks passed without talking to Jamie. One day my mother told me that their family was coming by to visit. At first I was like oh okay. And at this point I totally forgot about Jamies so called business venture. I cleaned up everything and went to the market to get all the foods for a big family dinner. When I returned I saw the family was already there. I got out of my car and greeted everyone with a smile. But when I got to Jamie, they seemed cold and did not smile back.

A few hours later Jamie called everyone to the living room. I was in the kitchen cooking with my Father. My Father told me to go, he was to busy too take a look. So I did. Jamie had their laptop open. And they gave me a look. Like not a good one I think? I do not know.

So we sat down. Jamie opened up a power point. And started talking about a travel business. And everything came back to me! After a bit I got tired of hearing it all. I raised my hand and Jamie looked at me and said ""Yes?...."" 

Me \- Did you make this?

Jamie \- No.

Me \- Where did you get it? It looks like something a kid from middle school made.

My mom like elbowed me a little. I guess because I came off rude.

Jamie \- I do not think that is your business. BUT I got it from a man.

My Mother \- Where did you meet this man?

Jamie \- At Starbucks. He is really nice!

My Mother \- I see.

Me \- Wait. Did you fall for a scammer? Like real life ones?

Jamie Mother \- If you all are going to be rude to Jamie maybe its best we go.

My Father came out and said there was no need and to continue.

Jamie was talking about how this travel agency is the new deal. And how it makes 3 to 5 trillion dollars a year.

And how we should all get into it. And I was thinking, if it's so much why are we at war in the Middle\-East?

Gosh like I wanted to stand up and go off, but my mother was giving that look to stand down and don't start anything. 

Jamie went on to say \- Who does not want to make pillow money? Why have someone go through a website for travel when I can do it and get their money?!\-

And me and my mom looked at each other and were like \- What happen to Jamie?\-

So many red flags, I'm sure you can find the PlanNet / Intele Travel \- power point videos on the internet and Facebook with people talking about it. It is so sad. 

It just amazes me Jamie side of the family are just losing all critical thinking and acting like morons.  Like okay I get it you want to help your family but what the hell. 

So after an hour or something. Jamie finished. It was such a waste of time. Thank God we got to eat, but it was awkward silence kind of. 

I had to set across Jamie. And it felt like a standoff with Jamie. I did whisper to Jamie ""Look, you're getting scammed. Snap out of it."" But that did not work lol.

It was awkward afterwards. I try to talking to Jamie parents but they didn't seem to care or anything. Jamie mother has always had an odd smile I thought, like she never smiles really and when she does it's like a force weird smile? and she just looks emotionally dead. Like a lifeless soul. And Jamies Father just has that attitude of like he doesn't care as long as the everyone is happy doing their thing, doesn't matter if it's right or wrong. That side of the family is very different from my household family.

The next day they left. I got home from work and talked to my father since it's his side of the family. 

He told me he understood it all and felt the same way when he was growing up. Apparently his parents and his siblings have all been into that stuff. But he never fell for it and believed it to be dishonest and unmoral. 

He says that side of the family is not like ours, they have different beliefs and twist our Christian religion to benefit their ongoing crusade with MLM. He told me that is why we do not talk to them much, that side of the family. When we do we don't again for another few years. But they are family. But they chose that life, and there is nothing we could do. And it would be best to forget everything and don't worry about it. We cannot help them. He said he try for years and just kept burning bridges, His younger brother didn't forgive him about it all until he was on his death bed. And he doubt his sister would see reason. She's too far gone I believe to be saved .

It is just so shocking. Like I feel sad for them. But I have this desire to help them see the reason I guess? Everyone in MLMs seems be driven mad and brainwashed . Like to the dark side ?

After two weeks passed. Jamie had like what 200 something friends on Facebook. Mostly us family and Jamies friends. Then Jamie tagged me in something the next day. And woah Jamie had like 2k friends! Which were all people from PlanNet Marketing and InteIe travel people ... I was like woah man. And it was about Jamie now having their own business. And now they are their own boss. And Jamie is now a boss person and an entrepreneur. And has their own travel agency. Which to me is a load of blah blah.

So I called Jamie. And it went like this from what I recall.

Me \- Hey, I know you hate me. And think I am out to destroy your hopes and dreams. But could you give me 5 minutes? 

Jamie \- Make it fast.

Me \- Were family. And since you are part of my family. I feel it is my duty to protect my family.

Jamie \- \*Sigh\*

Me \- I called a real travel agent. Actually I called at least 3. And talk to them for about an hour or so. And they told me what you are getting into is not real. And to back out while you can. You will not make any money. You are being taken advantage of. If you really want to start your real own travel agency, it is important you go to college and get a travel degree. Work with a real travel agency for some time, build rep and etc. And then maybe with money you saved or with a loan you can open a real place. You say it's your business but it is not. You are not the boss. You answer to that company. Everything goes through that company. And you have to be license to sell travel in your state, by your state. You just can't pay 200$ to buy a travel ID certification. You have to go to months of schooling and state testing and all this stuff. You said you paid 200$ and only did an hour of travel schooling with their videos and they gave you the ID card that says you are an independent travel agent. Also you said you have to pay them 60\-70$ each month to keep working for them. Can't you see you are being played?

Jamie \- Jamie snapped me and said some very rude things to me. And then hang up on me. 

I sent Jamie a long text and email of everything laid out. With facts, and money facts and how it all works and everything. I spent hours gathering all the info I could. I felt like I was presenting a case to a court room. But after all that. Jamie said to me to go away and never talk to them again.

Later on my father said Jamie goes to those MLM events now. And has a new significant other that goes with them and is part of Jamies team of 3 or 5. I guess Jamie got rid of their old significant other. And since I had them on Facebook. I messaged them. We talked for an hour on Facebook IM, and Jamie basically ended everything because the S.O didn't agree with what Jamie was doing and was destroying the relationship fast.

I told them wow I was in shock and so sorry. I hope that they find someone one day. After that, I was just in shock. I talked to mother about it but she said that side of the family is what they are, and that stupid is as stupid does.

So I found videos of this PlanNet Marketing events, it was really weird. Like it looks like a night club event and like a church, and people sing about money, and get weird rewards for how many people recruit. And it is just strange. And everyone looks so happy. Like maybe brainwashed happy? I don't know man. Like I want to say Jamie fell victim, but it doesn't feel that way. They seem to be really into it. And does not plan to come out. And since MLM is big in that side of the family. It seems like that side of the family will continue the MLM family tree. Unless one of those kids are like my father and see its stupid and doesn't follow it.

Anyway it got to the point of I was tired of see Jamies crap all over social media and my Pinterest for my memes and my Instagram feed. So I removed Jamie. I do not think they notice or care. I do not think I will ever talk to them again. And I do not really like my father side of the family anyway. They are just to...I don't know.

I looked into more of PlanNet Marketing and Intele Travel. I found every recruiter also. They go to poor neighborhoods and college campuses and churches and malls and food places. To do their pitch and recruiting. And guess what? Every back ground check. Every court house I called and police station and government websites I looked in. Everything single thing I found. Left me in total shock.

These people have been in and out of jail like crazy. Have been sued by people and the government like crazy. None really have a professional back ground in any business jobs! Like legit business jobs. A lot have been scamming people since the 1980s/1990s and still doing it today. Many I found use to be in gangs but I think a lot still are. It is just crazy. A lot of them call themselves mentors and success coaches and all this stuff. And that they are showing people the light and they way. And that every interaction is an opportunity to make a positive impact on others. And how your level of success is determined by your level of discipline and perseverance. And that they are empowering women and men to have a beautiful life. 

This one recruiter really twists and exploits my Christian religion to their MLM advantage. And that makes me very mad. I know there are many fake Christians out there and dishonest ones, but I try my very best to stay true to everything I hold.

At the MLM event the people say, that you should discard people who disbelieve in your business venture.  And that there are two different peoples in this world. the ones who believe and the ones who do not. And that God doesn't not want you to be around them. And as a true normal Christian that makes me so mad to hear. That they are twisting everything. And making us look bad and like radicals. They say to never give up and you have to keep at it, and to stay in it, that it could take years but one day you will be at the top like them. There is so much more they talk about. But it is all twisted nonsense. And to use my God the Holy Father for your MLM scheme, makes me so angry.

A lot in PlanNet Marketing / Intele Travel \- is African\-Americans. And has you know, many in that category live poor lives. And I pity them. And wish them the very best. Many are great and sane people and good people. But the bad ones out do them. And put them in the shadows in this world I believe. I hope that changes one day. Many white household wives and their husbands who are from the suburbs are in it to. Many poor college people are in it. And just many suckers all in all too. 

When you try to debate them, they will block you. When you start asking to many questions they will block you. When you start calling them out on every red flag they will block you. Basically, if you are not with them. Then you are against them. Which is kinda true I guess. 

PlanNet Marketing \- Founder and CEO is Donald D Bardley. He was vice president of marketing for ""Paycation"" which is a home based travel scam. Mr.Donald has been sued many times by the U.S. Government. But since he has a lot money, he is always able to pay the government and not be sent to prison. Yet. PlanNet Marketing promotes ""Intele Travel"" which is another home base travel scam. Also World Ventures which is another travel scam. And ""Pro Travel Network/YTB International, which is another home base travel scam. These are all Travel MLMs. 

When I talked to Intele Travel and PlanNet Marketing \- They have no employees. No benefits, no hours to clock in. The only way to get money is to recruit people in your down line. You will hardly ever book anyone. Now I got this info with a lot of mind games with the person. And say you do book someone, you will only get 10&amp;#37; of that booking and will have to split it with your down line. And say you book someone above 1000$ for a trip which is beyond rare, you will get 100$ or something and that is not worth it. It is a pyramid travel scam. 

The only defense they give me is that the BBB \*Better Business Bureau"" gives them good reviews. But when you read the reviews on there, it's all fake and like bots with fake stories. I think they had their people post only all good stuff. And to be honest it is not hard to get a profile on BBB if you pay a feed lol. Anyone can do it. 

Note just because your profile is on BBB doesn't mean you have BBB accreditation. Note they are not registered with the state of GA which where their man founders base is. Because if they did try they would get shut down so fast and sued by GA. They also are not seen as legit by ""Limited Liability Company"". All in all there are so many red flags. You should see their income disclosure. It is such a sad failure. 

Since PlanNet Marketing is kinda new still. They are not really in the view of the public. But they need to be, so there true colors can show. You guys are welcome to google them and youtube them. But NOTE their people are everywhere on youtube and google only saying good things, the real reviews and the real people are in the shadows and hard to find. You can even watch ""PNM"" videos on youtube, and to be honest its crap. They act like they are celebrities. And they beat around the bush so much its tiring. 

You are welcome to report them to the FBI and the State of GA and Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Please do not trust in PlanNet Marketing / Intele Travel! Do not go in it and fall for it. It is a pyramid scheme and ponzi scheme!

nd,"I’m leaving this subreddit, since I am no longer a virgin (hooray!)
But before I did so, I wanted to tell you that there is always hope, guys. Trust me.
I was going through a very tough time in life, I was willing to beg my best friend to fuck me just to get rid of my burden, but then I met a wonderful girl, that started to love me for who u was (I didn’t even think it was possible to stand me, let alone love me!) and I fell in love too. We now have a beautiful relationship, the kind I could have never even dreamt of... I am a changed man and I am happy: thing that two months ago I would have never deemed possible! 
I thought that, at best, I would have lost my verginity in a one night stand, but now I have much much more.
I feel like I don’t deserve this, but I now understand that it might sound corny, but that hope is really the last to die, that you must have hope in life... Guys, don’t worry, life will smile at you and you will find someone, even if you feel like you don’t deserve anyone and even if you feel ugly, undesirable, annoying. 

Carry on guys, and farewell! 

PS. And DON’T worry about being bad in bed and don’t be afraid about “having too small of a penis” or “lasting very little time”. It’s all in your head, trust me."

When I reported this to the police they stated that they couldn't legally do anything until there's a third incident. My own research shows no sign of this law, but they refuse to do more. I've reported every text, showed them, showed my wife's social media, and they won't do anything. They claim there's not enough evidence for a restraining order. They also refuse to take anymore reports until something more substantial happens.

nd,"Hello r/Crushes,

I just spent an entire Sunday morning just laying in bed thinking about her. My friend. The thoughts circling so constantly just below the surface and now wells forth like an unstoppable force. Her smile. Her laugh. The way her eyes crinkle in those cheerful curves. Her dimples. The fact that she thinks I'm funny. The fact that she thinks I'm the smartest guy she knows. The fact that she thinks my passion is awesome. The way she loves her dogs and always go into baby voice mode when talking to them. The way she gets so excited and starts texting in all caps. And it doesn't help that I think she's gorgeous. But again, she is my friend. I good close friend. And I'm so afraid to cross that line. Not because of rejection, not because it may make us awkward. It's because I'm afraid that it may hurt her. She's been going through relationship issues. And I've become her confidant. I know she hates the fact that her male friends all fall for her. How could they not? She's beautiful inside and out. She hates the fact that she can't just leave and ignore these people despite this either. She knows it's not healthy. But her waning confidence makes it that much harder to move on. I want to help her. I want to support her with the best of my ability. I want her to be happy dammit… she deserves so much more. Hell, she deserves to have happiness. She needs to know that she is beautiful and that she doesn't need all these stupid men in her life to validate that. She needs to know that she is amazing. She needs to know that she can be the confident women she inspires to be. She doesn't need me. So here are my selfish emotions. A foolish friend crushing and now falling for that pretty friend. Because just like every other foolish man in her life, I couldn't help it…

Signed,
The Foolish Friend"

nd,"Hello. I'm making this thread because I've been doing some math while ranked is down trying to determine just how valuable specific runes actually are and seem to have hit a wall regarding **Conditioning**.   
.  
I'm looking at a recent game with that rune in my match history, and it says I was granted **19 bonus armor**, and **13 bonus magic resist**.  
However, at the end of that game, I was a level 15 Thresh. My only items with resists were Vow, Locket, and Ninja Tabi.  
Which added together would mean that from items only, I had **+90 armor** (I count Vow as 40, not 60, since I believe the post-game rune page is based on flat stats and wouldn't include the +20 near your partner) and **+60 magic resist**.  
At level 15 my base stats are **28 armor** and **36.6 magic resist**. The *Conditioning* rune also grants a flat +8 to both.  
This would mean that my total stats with these items *and* the +8 conditioning passive should be **126 armor** and **104.6 magic resist**.  
In which case the **0.05% conditioning bonus** should be **+6.3 armor** and **+5.23 magic resist**.  
.  
.  
However looking at the post-game rune screen I see that my *Conditioning* rune granted me a total of **19 armor** and **13 magic resist**. Which is about 3x the amount of bonus armor, and 2x the amount of bonus magic resist.  
.  
In the replay of the game in question at the very end I'm only level 14 (can't target myself when I'm 15 unfortunately) and have **213 armor** and **109 magic resist**. In the game, I apparently have almost 100 armor more than I should when combining the items and my base armor, but almost the same magic resist. Though even if I did have 213 base armor, the 0.05% conditioning rune should only increase by 10.65, yet my post-game screen tells me I had +19.   
.  
Is there something that I am forgetting to factor into my calculations? I can't seem to find out how my conditioning rune gave me so much stats when it's supposed to only be a 5% increase. I can't seem to find a way that this makes sense. I'm sure that I must be overlooking something, or there's some sort of item/rune/whatever interaction that I wasn't aware of.  
.  
Worth noting that when I took my stats from the in-game client towards the end of this post I **did not** have Aftershock active, so I know that isn't what's causing this anomaly. Any and all assistance would be appreciated, thanks to anyone/everyone who took the time to read this. GLHF everyone out there!"

nd,"Hello, I am looking for suggestions for what classes to main/alt based on whats below. I am very indecisive here, which is unusual for me, but I would love your opinion on this.  

**What have you played before?**
I have played Priest, Death Knight, Warlock, Shaman, Monk, Paladin, and Druid at a 110 level. Rogue is at 65.

**Describe what you liked and disliked about those classes.**
*Priest* - My first character. I love the fantasy, the class hall, and my character. I play Shadow and Disc mainly. I like Disc as a healing spec, and bonus healing spec Holy is nice too. My biggest problem with Priest is the movement, as well as the lack of on demand damage that Shadow has, as well as the prevalence of Warlocks. Also, this character has all of my Argus reputation at exalted, which is important.

*DK* - My highest /played time. Again, I love the fantasy. Everyone knows that the DK's biggest drawback is the movement, and its killer. I don't mind it in current content but when I am farming old content for transmog, achievements, and other stuff you definitely feel it. I love unholy, and do not like frost that much because it is so simple. Blood is nice too. This character has my Broken Isles reputations, as well as Blacksmithing and Mining maxed out. 

*Warlock* - Warlock is alright. Like DK, it doesn't have a lot of movement options (especially hurts in PvP) but has exceptional healing (as affliction). This class is not really on the table for me, because it is a pure DPS spec, which makes LFG and life a little harder, and less opportunity to branch out. Also, I do not feel 'at home' on Warlock, if that makes any sense to you. I know I don't want to play warlock, at least for now. 

*Shaman* - Shaman is an intriguing class. I like the state that enhancement is in, and dislike the state elemental is in (at least for PvE, in PvP its basically insta glad). Resto i have not touched, but am interested in. 

*Monk* - Windwalker is fun and does a lot of damage, Brewmaster is a pretty fun and mobile tanking spec, and Mistweaver I have not played that much at all. This class I would like to be one of my alts. Also this legendary ring that grants chi orbit is some garbage that is such an annoying ability lmao. I like the movement of this class. 

*Paladin* - My freshest 110. I leveled it with a friend from level 1 that just got into WoW. I have played a paladin before (in WotLK) but keep hearing that ret is a wheelchair spec, and I definitely don't really want to play protection (would rather just play blood/brewmaster) but am very open to Holy. I don't really have a lot to say about this class other than it feels choppy. 

*Rogue* - Level 65, but really enjoyable. I find that stealthing past everything is awesome, and yeah thats pretty much it I can't really say much about this class because like I said its not 110. 

*Druid* - Don't really like druid that much. Balance is pretty fun I guess. Not a contender for me though but it is important to list what I dislike: Feral has a lot of buttons, and I know this is pretty weird considering I like windwalker and unholy but I just don't get the same satisfaction from the spec as I do the others. Resto is fine but I prefer the priest healing specs. Bear is cool, but I like Blood more! Its odd, but I do feel druid is a jack of all trades, master of none, finally (at least for me).

**With a friend or alone? What's your friend going to be leveling?**
I always play with 1-2 friends, but I would like for my main to be self sufficient. That's not a problem now-a-days anyway though. 

**Will you be doing primarily raids/dungeons at level cap (PvE) or knocking the opposing faction in the balls over a flag (PvP)?**
Definitely primarily Mythic+, then LFR/Normal/Heroic raid, then Arenas, in that order. Not really planning on raid progression. 

**Heals/tank/DPS? What's your style for DPS - melee or ranged?**
I like all three, but I would like for my main to have a melee dps spec. It just allows for that juicy on demand damage.

**Any favorite game mechanics? (DoTs, HoTs, stealth, mana, etc)**
Instantaneous damage would be nice to have, though, but I don't really have a preference here. 

**Hybrid or pure? Does it matter?**
It matters, but only for my main. It must have at least one tank or one healing spec. For my two alts, pure DPS is fine. 

**Pet or temporary pet or none at all? Does it matter?**
It doesn't matter that much to me, but I like the mechanics that unholy pet brings to the table with the extra grip and stun.

**Final Notes:**
Thanks for sitting through all of that, it was pretty therapeutic to write it all out. I am looking for a main and two alts to play for the rest of legion, do the achievements and stuff on. If I continue bouncing around characters for the rest of the expansion I know I am not going to get anything done, which is pretty annoying. I posted this on the WoW official forum too but I usually have more success on this subreddit."

nd,"Maybe this isn’t appropriate for this subreddit but here goes:

Bit of background on me, I’m quite a reserved person and an introvert but I’m comfortable in social settings. I certainly prefer listening or even better having a conversation one-to-one rather than in groups.

Three months ago I was assaulted in an unprovoked attack with a knife and I was punched up pretty bad which resulted in a fractured jaw. Since then I’ve felt quite withdrawn and am experiencing issues in social settings I didn’t have prior to the assault. Particularly looking people in eye, withdrawn from conversations and anxiety about upsetting or angering people to the extent that I feel something bad will happen to me.

I feel the impulse to tell people what happened to justify why I come across withdrawn etc.

Also in public settings, rather than in my own home, I feel so alert and on edge that I can hardly concentrate.

What’s the best steps to rebuild my confidence from what happened and become more engaged in social settings?

nd,"(outside of captivity or pics from down under)

This just fucking happened. This behemoth was chilling in my garage like it owned the place. Though normally I'd be one to remove the little buggers and place them outdoors, the size of this one deeply concerned me. It had to go. The closest smushing instrument available was a shoe, my husband's. It's heavy, I can throw it. And I do. As soon as that damn thing makes impact, a cloud appears, floats to the ground, and scatters. What the fucking fuckhole??? I tried to smash the flurry with the other shoe (cuz damned if I was going to touch the original one with a ten foot pole), and the wind of the damn thing blew them away! I tried to scrape and smush the rest, but I know I have a metric fuckton of baby spiders in the garage just biding their time. Jeezus.

TL;DR fucking baby spiders explode. I'm still finding them.

Edit to add a picture of the visible aftermath. Mind you, the mama shrunk drastically in size after the smushing. [And these are just the casualties.](https://i.imgur.com/1l1y69K.jpg)"
nd,"Hi all. Not a beekeeper (although I would love to try it someday!), but just have questions about bees that appeared in my house today.

About an hour ago I discovered a single bee in the front room. 10 minutes later, 6-7 more showed up. 3-4 of them were staying on/near one window, so I'm guessing they are getting in somewhere around that window?  Now that an hour has passed, there are still about 4-5 of them in the front room that I can see/hear, as well as 3 dead bees on the ground just outside that window.  

Do you think a few of these bees escaped the house and died for some reason shortly after escaping? The 3 dead bees were not there an hour ago when I first discovered the bees in the house.  There is also a wasp hanging around outside near that window. Do wasps kill bees?  

Also, do you think they have a hive on/in the house? I can't imagine that 8 separate bees would just happen to get stuck inside a house if they don't have an actual hive in it somewhere. I've had a single bee get inside the house before, but never 8 all at once. 

I feel bad because they are clearly stressed trying to get out of the house, and I think another one has now died on the floor inside of the house. I don't know how to get them out without potentially hurting them more. If I put a little water out, will that help them live longer until we can get them out?"

However, last night I lifted up my stereo to look for something (don’t even remember what I was looking for) and found it under there! Didn’t think I would ever have a JJ moment, but it was definitely relieving to find that. Just wish it happened when I was hurting haha Anyways hope everyone has a nice positive unsick Thursday!"
nd,"Hey guys,

So first of all I hope you don’t mind another “how to ollie” post. I find there’s a lot of information out there about ollies, but no one really gets deep into how the jumps work. 

So as I’m rolling along I generally drop down to about a 5 or a 6 (where 1 is standing upright and 10 is with my butt on my heels). I load up mainly on my front foot, so as I’m stretching my legs out I’d say I’m pushing with about 70-80% of the force down through my right leg. As I’m beginning the jump and moving my body up into the air I tuck my front foot up ready to slide and push my back foot down on the tail to get the pop. Then I tuck my back foot up. 

Jumping off my front foot makes sense to me with my limited knowledge of physics. People tell me I should jump off both feet or even just the back foot, but that doesn’t really make sense. If I’m jumping off my back foot and my front foot is already off the board, there’s nothing to counter the pressure as I’m jumping and my foot just slams the tail into the ground trapping it there and killing the ollie. It’s got to be the front foot, right? Because then I can load a lot more pressure onto it because it’s in the middle of the deck and the trucks keep the board stable as I’m jumping. 

I’ve tried watching vids, but even at super slomo you can’t tell which foot they’re jumping from because the back foot always lags behind the front during the jump to get the pop. 

Thanks guys. :)"
nd,"After a long time of dealing with Smok and their coils and even having bad coils from third party manufacturers, I wanted to get back into RDAs. I had a bunch from back when I dripped and every RDA \(even the ones that worked\) had some problem that irritated me: no delrin drip tip, bad air flow, bad flavor, leaks too easy, gets too hot, etc. I went to get some juice from a local shop and knew they had the Dead Rabbit RDA.

I fucking love you guys. I don't know if this is the best RDA ever but it is the best RDA I have ever owned. I may actually buy a second one to have a spare. Super easy for me to build on this, flavor is great, vapor production is great, the juice wells are HUGE, the airflow ports are at the perfect spot \(hasn't leaked on me yet\), the logo is nice, the resin tip is nice, the RDA doesn't get hot and melt my lips together. I can't find one bad thing about this RDA. I know some people have said they had spitback but I put my coils close to the posts and haven't had any spitback yet.

Anyway, if you're like me and have been on the fence about getting this RDA, I'd say get it. I thought it was probably over hyped but for me this is a perfect RDA. If you've been using tanks and want to get an RDA, get this one.

nd,"I've posted here a few times before but always deleted it a few minutes later because I get scared, mainly because I don't want this to be a dead bedroom, but I'm scared that's where it's going. I'm a HLF (27) and he's a LL M (39)

I'm thinking that one of the big problems atm is that I'm not very good at just straight up asking for sex. I've tried a few times in the past but got shot down, and honestly, it hurt my self-esteem so much I've stopped initiating and just wait for him to want me. Problem is, when he wants me it's just not enough. Maybe I'm hypersexual, but once every 1.5 weeks for me is like giving a shot glass of water to someone dying of thirst. It just makes it worse, so I've been trying to kill my libido (yes, yes, I know. Stupid move) and that's been an absolute fucking disaster. It works for a few days where I just numb myself to everything, then it hits me like a tsunami and I'm back in a world of pain. 

To be honest, my husband is not the type to pick up on hints, and I'm not very good at making them either, so I'm just going to be blunt. If we're going to end up in a DB I don't want it to be because I didn't communicate my needs. 

Here's hoping I don't chicken out :/"

First of many modifications too come.

I wanted to start with some budget products, I can't afford to spend much at the moment. I found a post in which somebody recommended these three products from Cerave and they're quite cheap. There's an [AM Moisturizer](https://www.docmorris.de/cerave-feuchtigkeitsspendende-tagescreme/14017665?bvUserToken=&amp;refKey=INVALID&amp;optimizelyScript=%2F%2Fcdn.optimizely.com%2Fjs%2F2935510093.js&amp;userlikeScript=%2F%2Fuserlike-cdn-widgets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2F94eb2c1d581eef989e6f0297df96e66daf033dd30504be99ca749e54126238e3.js&amp;recom=true&amp;wishlistCount=0&amp;customer_enable_change_data=true&amp;gtmNoScript=&amp;gtmScript=&amp;hid=35037c40c2380775f9db24a4db94ceb1&amp;jsenv=prod), a [PM Moisturizer](https://www.docmorris.de/cerave-feuchtigkeitsspendende-nachtcreme/14017671?bvUserToken=&amp;refKey=INVALID&amp;optimizelyScript=%2F%2Fcdn.optimizely.com%2Fjs%2F2935510093.js&amp;userlikeScript=%2F%2Fuserlike-cdn-widgets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2F94eb2c1d581eef989e6f0297df96e66daf033dd30504be99ca749e54126238e3.js&amp;recom=true&amp;wishlistCount=0&amp;customer_enable_change_data=true&amp;gtmNoScript=&amp;gtmScript=&amp;hid=35037c40c2380775f9db24a4db94ceb1&amp;jsenv=prod) and a [Cleanser](https://www.docmorris.de/cerave-schaeumendes-reinigungsgel/14017524?bvUserToken=&amp;refKey=INVALID&amp;optimizelyScript=%2F%2Fcdn.optimizely.com%2Fjs%2F2935510093.js&amp;userlikeScript=%2F%2Fuserlike-cdn-widgets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2F94eb2c1d581eef989e6f0297df96e66daf033dd30504be99ca749e54126238e3.js&amp;recom=true&amp;wishlistCount=0&amp;customer_enable_change_data=true&amp;gtmNoScript=&amp;gtmScript=&amp;hid=35037c40c2380775f9db24a4db94ceb1&amp;jsenv=prod). My skin is a bit oily, so I chose the foaming cleanser. The AM Moisturizer has sunscreen, so I'm not going to buy one.

What do you think about these products? Are there any essential products I missed? I can only buy products from Europe, so most of the recommended products I found in this sub are inaccessible to me.

Ps. I'm a guy, if that makes any difference"
nd,"So, I’ve been following and playing dota for pretty much 5 years, until June last year when I sadly had to stop playing due to 3rd year uni ):  But now I’m free and so much has changed! Wondering if any kind souls can point me towards some good games to watch from the last year so I can catch up"
nd,"So a few months ago I fell out of my first relationship. For context, I’m 20, while she was 24 and had been with a few other people before me. I figured that was a good sign since I had no idea what I was doing. I thought that might help. When I look back at the relationship, it becomes more and more clear what wasn’t working. I thought that if I kept trying hard, then maybe I could fix things, make it up to her as if I had been in the wrong.
	
I’m not perfect. Not anywhere close. But during the first while everything went great. There weren’t any kind of disagreements until about three months in. I had some feelings in the back of my head that things weren’t quite right, like the fact that I was being kept a secret, but my head always gives me reason and I thought that for once I would just ignore it. I did that for as long as I could.

Reading all these stories, I realize now that there may have been far more going on than I saw at the time. When she was down, I always managed to cheer her up. She’d been in a bad crash a few years before I met her, and I know it cause her to act out. I didn’t want to say anything about because she always told me that people left her because they couldn’t deal with the fact that she’d been in a crash. Now I know that that isn’t the reason.

There were inconsistencies in her stories. Holes. She wouldn’t tell me things. I tried not to mind them. Put them in the back of my head, but eventually it wore on me. She had told me that she wanted me to tell me what was on my mind, and I did. How I was worried that she only considered me an option. How she would often show up late and tell me that I shouldn’t care about it. That she would drop plans at the last second to see her friend, who she talked about all the time and I wonder now if maybe she had feelings for. Reading through all of these posts, I realise a lot of them apply to my situation and the way I was treated. Sometimes I still wonder if I was the bad guy. I apologized often, even when I was sure I hadn’t done anything wrong. Even when I thought I was the one owed an apology. It wasn’t me who was 20 minutes late to the park. It was her that just… decided to show up twenty minutes late. Somehow, I ended up apologizing about the fact that I was disappointed that she was late.

Eventually, it wore on me. I was always wrong. There was always something, someone, or somewhere else to be. It got to me. My mood worsened. I let her know about it. We had a discussion. I let her know what was bothering me. She let me know what was bothering her. I did my best to change. She didn’t do a thing. Things kept going that way for a while until she got fed up with my mood.
	
She always told me that I wouldn’t be able to break up with her. In the end, she was right. I wish I could have, though. I feel like it might have been the only thing that could have helped her. I feel like maybe it would have made her understand that something was wrong. But I was afraid of being alone again, and I couldn’t do it. Now I’m worried that this might happen to someone else. Looking back, this didn’t only happen to me. I feel like if I broke up with her, it might have given her a reason to stop and think, but as it is, I’m afraid she’ll keep doing it. I do honestly hope that things get better for her, but I’m not sure they will. She doesn’t think she has a problem. The whole world is out to get her.

I’m not really sure what I’m trying to say. I feel like I was dragged along as a fallback in case other things didn’t work out, yet for some reason I still care for her, in the sense that I hope she can get better. I started out feeling like she thought I was perfect, but by the end I was just another of the people that she had been telling me about. I realise that I did the best I could, at least, I think I did. But I wonder if there was more I could have done.

I'm sorry, I didn't intend for this to be so long and awkwardly worded. I just wanted to get this out."

After doing this, Rose calls a meeting where everyone gathers and they make new plans where everyone doesn't end up dead.

1. **Do not ask for diagnostic or analytic impressions.** It is unethical to give diagnoses or analyses over the internet. These types of questions are better asked of a therapist in\-person. 
2. **Questions must be asked clearly in the post title.** Violations of this rule will be removed immediately. You may give additional or clarifying information in the body of your post.
3. **Answers must be evidence\-based.** Answers given must reflect the scientific consensus and ideally should cite sources. Anecdotal evidence or pop\-psychology will be removed.
4. **No leading questions.**  Examples of these questions are: ""Why is Group X so stupid?"" or ""What is wrong with Group X?"" 
5. **No jokes, memes, insults, or slurs.**  This is an academic subreddit, and while discussion is encouraged, any  off\-topic or non\-academic comments will be removed. This includes the  use of slang terms or slurs to describe any phenomenon or group of  people. 

Removal of posts and comments is at the sole discretion of the moderation team.

what can I possibly hope to gain from this? I don't know.  There's really no point.  I don't have it in me to contact you directly.  I'm pretty sure you will think I am crazy.  I'm not.

But I do enjoy when little things remind me of you.  At first, it was seeing the kind of car you drove back then.  Oh, but by a few years after we left school everyone had one.  Ahead of your time, you were.  For a long time then, being desensitized to the appearance of Outbacks, I don't think I thought about you very often.  I didn't think about you at all.  But now, I'll see or hear something, and it will bring a smile to my face.  I indulge in a few moments of thinking about the good times.  There are a few specific songs that sometimes play on the radio.  By now, they're considered throwback thursday material.  Damn.

So, again: what can I possibly hope to gain from this?  And, again, I do not know.  I think it would never be enough.  But I wish we could talk."

Im going to try to be as detailed as possible.Even after getting advice from everyone here i know in the end i have to control my spending impulses to stop myself from getting into debt again and this has been a fight for many many years.

Assuming i can kick my own ass and maintain financial discipline should i use the savings of over 7000 from GI Bill stipend and wipe out the two credit cards and be left with some from that?What about the money from the other savings?I created those accounts so i would save towards something instead of using my checking account or credit card.I had 10k at one point but i effed up with credit card spending AGAIN and paying them off and using them AGAIN.Thank you everyone for your help."
nd,"Hi folks, I could use your advice.

I have to move out of my rental this week. Moving fills me with crippling anxiety for three reasons that I've identified before:

1. Sorting through my old things and deciding what to keep takes me back to unhappy memories.

2. I never know if the place I'm moving to will trigger me once I get there. it usually does.

3. I am autistic and changes to my environment upset me.

The way I usually solve this problem is to get drunk - I'm an alcoholic. I've been sober for a couple weeks but I can hear the liquor calling me into its warm embrace. So, advice:

Should I go with absinthe or white russians?

nd,"The latest wave of EX raid pass invitations came out yesterday (5/6/2018) and my local raid community noticed that the only people who were excluded were the most active raiders. We had 4 locations in Brooklyn that we triggered and every raider that raided those locations got an invitation to one of the 4,... all except for the power raiders. They spend real money for raid passes and hit around 20 raids all over brooklyn nearly daily. 

I honestly think it's a little messed up that Niantic excluded them. It's because of them that these 4 locations were triggered. Without them, a lot of raids (ex eligible or otherwise) might not happen. Plus, they actually spent actual money in this game.

I'm not sure if anyone else noticed this occurring in their local pogo community. And for everyone's reference, in case you believe it is because they have too many mewtwo, one of these active raiders only just started being active in the last 1.5 to 2 month. I know other people who have 10 mewtwo and still got the invite. The only common denominator seems to be the massive number of raids they have completed recently."

nd,Hi I need help finding a song that I've had the hardest time finding! It was a song I used to listen to all the time on the Ello YouTube channel. They deleted it so I need help finding it elsewhere. The song basically took place in a dried up ship yard. A desert with rusty equipment all around and many of the people were singing on the rusty boat. There were at least 2 gorgeous women singing and different guys rapping. I need some help here! This song was deleted years ago so this is why I need help. The place they shot it in looks a lot like the dried up shipyards in Uzbekistan. I understand this would be kind of difficult to find. The genre would be in between rap and pop and it's a modern song. Any help would be appreciated.
nd,"So I attended my young cousins graduation Thursday. Due to serious health issues that caused her to miss many days of school, she decided to go into an accelerated program and graduated two years earlier than she would have if she stayed at her old school. I'm very happy for her, but when I asked her if she was all set for going to college, since I knew that was what she wanted to do, she said she hasn't done anything since the counselors at the accelerated school told her and her mother she could not apply for FASFA or a college until she received her diploma. Because of this misinformation, she missed the FASFA deadline for state aid and a scholarship opportunity. I don't even think she took the SAT or ACT because of them. I plan to help her apply to everything tomorrow. From FASFA, even though she is applying late she may get some federal aid, but probably not anything grand.

Has anybody had a similar experience or any advice that could help her with her situation?"

nd,"Hi just need to rant to people that can relate...I'm finally moving out on my own. Unfortunately, with the timing of when we found the apartment and work schedules, we're moving on Mother's day this Sunday. This didn't seem to bother my nmom, but her true colors are starting to peak through.
 
Moving out was always the goal since I graduated college in May 2013 and moved back home. Now it's finally happening and I want to be excited. I feel so much dread though. I feel like i'm pulling myself out of a pit of quick sand. 

Everything I do, say or want to do is met with her glaring opinion. Her way is the best way and you're a fucking idiot if you think otherwise. When I was growing up, i learned to cope by keeping my life an absolute secret from her. She resents this. She hates that I don't really talk to her and I just stick to neutral topics. 

Some background: My nmom depends heavily on alcohol, too lazy to cook/clean for herself, type 2 diabetic and eats fast food multiple times a week. She has no friends. Her one friend got 'written off' because she didn't come to my HS grad party. My nmom got herself in a heap of credit card debt and it finally bit her in the ass a few years ago. A sheriff came to the house and served papers. I was the only one home. She had a lawyer settle it and she had to pay almost a grand each month to pay off the debt. During that period, I was pressured into taking out 2 personal loans so my parents could pay her property taxes. My dad gives me the money to make the payment each month. She just recently finished her payments and it seems like she hasn't learned her lesson whatsoever. There's boxes from QVC showing up to our house few times a week. I don't think she has a new credit card, but she's just mindlessly spending the money she used to have to pay every month. At our house, a pipe broke almost a year ago that stopped us from being able to use our kitchen sink, bathroom sink and dishwasher. Therefore, all dishes have to be washed in the bathtub. To run the dishwasher, you have to run buckets outside of the dirty water. She is mindlessly spending the money she should be saving to fix this plumbing issue. This past year, I was doing the dishes 95% of the time.  I was a 'lazy bitch' if I didn't and I didn't want to live in a filthy house because no one cleaned up after themselves. I did most of the cleaning around the house. She acts like she's helpless. She'll come home and say 'help me' in a baby voice over and over again. It rattles a rage deep down inside. It was walking on eggshells growing up with her and even worse being a young adult sharing a home with her. If I fought back, she stopped talking to me which triggers my anxiety and puts me in a terrible state of mind. 

The situation at hand isn't the most terrible as blowouts in the past. I've been taking carloads of stuff over to the apartment after work this week. The furniture isn't getting moved till the weekend. There's been tension between my nmom and my future MIL. My Future MIL has been very generous giving us all sorts of stuff for our apartment. My nmom is seeing this as a competition of who can help the most. She was also upset that my fiancé didn't want to use her truck to move stuff. He wanted to spend $40 to rent a Uhaul van instead. My fiancé doesn't like my nmom for obvious reasons. But he just wanted the van because it makes everything easy to transport.

Last night my mom offered to help me unload my car full of stuff. I said that my fiance would be over so he could help take the stuff inside. There was no hidden meaning behind my answer. my thought in that split second before I spoke was that it was a lot of stairs and many of the boxes were heavy. i didn't want her to have to help if my fiancé was already going to be there. ANYWAYS, I guess she took that as I didn't want her at the apartment and now she's not speaking to me. She puts these ideas in her own head. She probably thinks i'm going to totally blow her off on Mother's day. I told her I was going to be busy but i'd pop in for a while. I knew when i'd move out that there would be tension separating myself from her. I did a lot of things to make her happy so I could try to save myself from living in a warzone. No one understand why I couldn't just tell her to fuck off. I just have to get through this process and hopefully there will be peace on the other side."
nd,"When Lady Olenna is talking to Jaime before she dies they discuss Tywin. She says something along the lines of

*""If he \[Tywin\] was so clever, why didn't he take High Garden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.""*

To my mind, this implies that she believes that there is some sort of afterlife in which she'll be meeting up with Tywin. Although I suppose this reference to an afterlife could be sarcastic.

Assuming however that she is talking about some sort of afterlife, somehow I can't imagine that she envisions Tywin going to heaven as she has a low opinion of him and the things he did in life. If anything I would imagine she might see Tywin going to Hell, if Westeros religions allow for anything of that nature. If that's the case and she is going to be able to meet up with him . . . does she believe she is going to go to 'Hell' too?"

I find it amusing that the groups who proclaim their right to believe in whatever they want and people who are willing/forced to go against what is considered natural want people to apologise to them, for expressing themselves. Aren't all these feminists, social/human rights activists who demand equality and mutual respect  ignoring the fact that the people they are fighting against have lived lives and have thought processes tailored to their own specifications.

nd,"First of all Im not a Kayn Main, tho I really enjoy the Champion while being a Toplane Main. 
With the recent changes of faster Soul Stacking early game, I think Toplane Kayn might be a valid pick, that could potentially be sleeper OL, especially as a counter pick to a tank which lets him farm early game and gives him the opportunity to get his form rather early while not being uncontested too much before getting it. Since I am to lazy (while I also dont have the time to invest this many games into trying things out) and you guys probably know more about this then I do :

In the following I am basically only talking about Rhaast, since Toplane SA will be a rare thing and I don't plan on picking it up at all whatsoever. 

Does Comet/Aery and Scorch count towards your passive? If yes, is it even worth running them (particularly against tanks) just to stack your passive faster in the early game (later on they dont do a whole lot for you compared to Grasp and especially to Conqueror)?

Is Maxing W first the way to go for laning, so that you can keep putting it on your enemy for orbs and poke (with Comet/Scorch) or is it better to take Aery/Grasp and max q and keep engaging trades? Or are both viable options and it depends on the match up/personal preference?

I think its fairly obvious, that you will want to get a Black Cleaver early on (for cdr, movment-speed and dmg/hp) aswell as a spirit visage for most games (cdr, hp and increased healing), but I am unsure about which armor item is the way to go, since everything ranging from GA, over to Randuins/Thornmail and Deadmans Plate seem reasonable. I can also imagine getting Frozen Heart 2nd in certain situations to rush 40% cdr (esp if you dont run the 10% cdr rune in Sorcery), while its also fine to have a lower HP pool and higher defensive stats since you already get hp from your spells and this way you can get more value out of the extra hp gained. Would something like Warmogs be worth anyway to get the out of Combat HP Regen? 
Is it even the correct decision to build more towards a full tank build after black cleaver and maybe a 2nd bruiser/ad item or should one stick to brusier items for the dmg and have a  build including items like Black Cleaver, Steraks/Maw, Titanic, GA, (Frozen Mallet, Blade of the Ruined King, Last Whisper or its upgrades) to get more Dmg in generell to also receive more healing? This more ad oriented build also sounds way stronger when using Conqueror as your keystone going up against a tank so you can deal tons of dmg to them, while increasing your healing even further (post-migation dmg is important here). 

I would love to get some opinions on this from more experienced Kayn Players who might have already tried this out.
Thanks to all of you in Advance!"

nd,"With the upcoming match between mousesports and Team Liquid later today, a dive into each of their paths up to this point at ESL Pro League Season 7 Finals and their recent history seems like a good use of our time. Each of their paths have been characterised by them running over opponents who are worse than them and losing to the better squads. The last two times they met, which was at StarSeries Season 4, they traded maps and series and mouz came out on top in the semi-final and went on to win the event against Natus Vincere. This time, the teams will duke it out in the quarterfinal to see who will face Na’Vi in the semi-final. Who do you think will make it out on top? I give my thoughts here. 

**mousesports**

In this tournament, mouz first encountered Sharks and handed Sharks their first defeat on the international stage on Inferno, albeit not as smoothly as could have been expected of mouz. A missing ropz played a part in this, but oskar played to his level and pulled home the win. Their next opponent in NRG, a team on fire online in recent times, proved to be a more potent adversary, yet mouz would once more pull out two map wins on Cache and Nuke. This time, ropz would topfrag across the series and played a huge part in the beatdown they gave NRG on Nuke. Across the series, oskar, suNny and ropz would all perform as the trio should.

In their next series, mouz met FaZe, recent champions of IEM Sydney, and proceeded to lose in disparaging fashion. While they would have a great performance, yet lose, on the first map of the series, Overpass, they would get their teeth kicked in on the next map, Mirage. FaZe are strong on Mirage, that we know. However, Mirage has been mouz’s strongest map and losing 16-4 with STYKO topping the scoreboard would make anyone’s hope plummet for mouz. Suffering defeat at FaZe’s hands would send mouz to the lower bracket of Group A.  

Here, they would face off against Heroic, in a newly formed Nordic version, and suNny would make up for his abysmal performance in his series against FaZe, this time topfragging on both Cache and Mirage. His performance would prove especially critical on Mirage, their home map, where they would win in close fashion, 16-14, thus granting them a spot in the quarterfinals. 

**Team Liquid**

Team Liquid, in the other group, clashed against the Australian squad in Grayhound in their first match of the tournament. Where mouz were a bit dicey in their first matchup, Team Liquid could best be described as clinical. EliGe would bring the hammer down and crush Grayhound on Cache, leading Liquid a dominant win.

In their next matchup, Liquid met a team in Space Soldiers who had been looking on great form, up until their collapse at Dreamhack Marseille. Missing out on IEM Sydney due to visas only seemed to put a fire in the belly of the Turkish team, yet Liquid would douse the flames and quench their hopes of a strong finish at this event. Surprisingly, TACO of all players would topfrag along with NAF across the series, leading analysts to speculate if TACO had been ‘unleashed’ from his coldzera-hand-holding days. Liquid would find a solid win on Mirage, albeit one where a come-back from Space Soldiers was mounting in the second half, and cruise through the second map, Inferno. With the team looking in high spirits, they would move on to their next matchup, this time against the favourites, Astralis. 

With the amount of firepower and prowess on Inferno Liquid has, one would hope, maybe even assume, that this matchup would at least go to three maps. This would not be the case against the form Astralis is currently in. On Nuke, Astralis would comfortably grind out the T-side and be in a comfortable lead going into the second half. The second half would follow suit, with Team Liquid’s T-side being dismantled efficiently by Astralis. Going into Inferno, a 10-16 scoreline on Nuke against Astralis might let Liquid fans get their hopes up. For any Liquid fan where this was the case, I feel sorry. On Inferno, Twistzz would find the ace on the first pistol round, but that would all be for nothing as they lost the following round and went on to lose 7-16, despite winning both pistol rounds. As has been known to happen when playing against Astralis, looking at you Virtus.Pro, dreams get shattered. However, this loss did not end their tournament, in simply sent them into a quarterfinal matchup against mouz.

**Recent History between mousesports and Team Liquid**


A little less than three months ago, StarSeries i-League Season 4 was going on and during that event, Liquid and mousesports played against each other in two best of three series. In the first, Liquid managed to pull out the win 2-1, losing Train in overtime and subsequently winning Mirage and Inferno in close fashion. In the second series, mouz managed to win comfortable on Mirage, only to get their shit pushed in on Cobblestone and then return to win without to much trouble on Train. 

**The Map Pool**

Looking at how their map pools have evolved and worked out since then, it is interesting to see how they have incorporated Dust2 and adapted to Cobblestone not being in the pool anymore. Now that Dust2 is in the map pool and Liquid has lost their beloved Cobblestone, their map pool has experienced changes. Despite not having played Dust2, they appear to not be afraid of the map, as they against Astralis chose to ban Cache over Dust2. Against Space Soldiers, they would have ended up on a Dust2 as a final map had the series gone to all three maps. Similarly, mouz has foregone banning it as opposed to leaving in Train versus Heroic or it has been banned against them, as in the case of the series against FaZe and NRG. As a result, it might be the third map of the series, should it go that far. 

The first two bans should play out as they have done in the past, with Liquid banning Nuke, as it is arguably mouz’s second best map, and mouz banning Overpass because they do not play it. With those out of the way, a Mirage pick from mouz is the obvious choice as they might be the best team on the map in the world. This leaves Liquid with a couple of choices. They could go for their best map, Inferno, or try to leave it for the third map, hoping mouz will not ban it. In the second series at StarSeries mouz banned it, so it should Liquid will probably pick it. 

This leaves Train, Cache and Dust2 as the remaining maps in the pool. Depending on who bans first, we will likely see one of two outcomes. If Liquid bans first, they will most likely ban Cache as they did at StarSeries, and this leaves mouz with the option to pick Train or Dust2. While Dust2 is something that has been left up by them every time so far this tournament, Train is a map they won in both series again Liquid at StarSeries. Train will likely be the choice, as there are stylistic and team compositional advantages for mouz on Train as opposed to Dust2. If mouz bans first, we will likely still see the Dust2 ban or perhaps even Cache, making sure they play either Dust2, which they may have prepared well, or Train which they won the previous times the teams met. Neither team has played Train or Dust2 during this tournament, so as a viewer, fingers are crossed to see either of those two.

**The Matchup**

Stylistically, both teams are looking quite similar. They have IGLs in chrisJ and nitr0 who both previously have been in other roles and have ended with the role more out of necessity, than the desire for the role. On the surface, both teams play loose and individualistic, yet this characteristic is a bit tricky to apply. 

On one hand, mouz have a tendency to play more aggressively than most teams, especially on T-side, and often they catch the CTs off-guard when playing their T-side. Their T-side can seem erratic, yet there is a good amount of teamplay and firepower behind their aggressive plays. 

On the other hand, Liquid play a slower pace of Counter-Strike and are more structured on their T-side, often going for defaults and working from there. Similarly to mouz, they play well off of each other and in the end, they are both more skill-focused teams, as opposed to very tactical teams.

In terms of individuals on the team, there is a large discrepancy between the quality of the AWPers on each team. Liquid has several hybrid players, but nitr0 is using it primarily. On one hand, nitr0 has looked average so far at this tournament. On the other, oskar has been arguably the best performing player on mouz and been hitting his shots on the AWP. Taking this into account, as well as the fact that mouz has a stronger double-AWP setup than Liquid, mouz definitely holds an advantage over Liquid in that aspect. 

Despite all of this, looking at how Liquid has been performing with their all of their players on rifles, they definitely looks dangerous on maps like Inferno and Dust2, both maps characterised by the amount of mid-range duels that each fight takes place at. In terms of firepower, the teams are similar in that they have three strong players in NAF, Twistzz and EliGe on one side and oskar, ropz and suNny on the other. Both teams have a supportive player in TACO and STYKO and an IGL who at times, yet not very often, can frag. 

**Prediction**

With how the pick/ban will likely play out, we will see Inferno, Mirage and Train/Dust2 as the three maps. Interesting to note is that mouz won against Astralis in OT on Inferno at IEM Sydney and Liquid won against Astralis on Mirage at Dreamhack Marseille. So either team’s map pick is something that the other can not just play, but play very well. 

This series could be a quick 2-0 to either side with how the teams have been looking. At the side time, it could be a close 2-1 series with both teams winning each other’s map and the third map playing out on a map that neither team has played so far this tournament. That is probably why this is a great match to tune into. There is no clear favourite, we have two similar but at the same time different teams and the maps are something in the middle of the pool which both teams are very good on. My guess for a winner would be mouz, yet I sincerely hope for NA CS that Team Liquid pulls themselves together and manages to make it work."

nd,Just wondering :) I've been feeling bummed about having few trans friends IRL.
nd,"Hi! Let's start from there that I have a really good girl friend from the other class. We know each other from the kindergarten. Before a month or two I started writing with her (flirting). I liked her but just wanted some private relationship.. After some days of chat she had already started with the hearts and kisses (just some sign that she also wanted to be more than friends). But suddenly I stopped writing because realized there is no chance everything to be hidden from the public (she is not the girl I want as a real girlfriend).

Her best (girl) friend is also her classmate. She is so pretty and natural! From some months (before start flirting with my friend), everywhere where we see each other (they go everywhere together) in school, they always smile and say ""Hi! Hey,"", etc. but nothing more. 2 weeks ago, a common friend of us (me and my best friend) invited us with our families to go to their country house. Of course we went! When we arrived they said that her best friend is also near us and we can meet. I agreed with no hesitation. We were sitting 5 people around the table - me and our common friend and 3 girls - my best friend, her friend and her cousin. Her cousin was talking all the time and I had only 2 or 3 chances to say something funny and interesting related to the current topic. I was pleased as she laughed. Also asked me and our common friend some questions that were related to school so can't say she have asked me something personal in order to understand something more about me. Some times she was about to say something and looking right at me but I was trying not to look at her at that time (I am really shy) because I wasn't sure what she wanted to say. I suppose it was something about my best friend because always before trying to say it she informed here - ""Lisa?!"". Something like I will do it. And her reaction was do whatever you want.

Since then I can't stop thinking about her! Haven't seen her much in school since then because I haven't been there. But when we met it was just the normal Hi. Really want to talk with her more but we don't attend the same classes and can't think of a way to ask or tell her something. I will feel really awkward if I just go and start asking her some strange questions.. Also, don't think to start a relationship in chat is a good way. Please for you advice!

nd,"We live in a suburban neighborhood where everyone has a fenced in yard. I share fence lines with three neighbors. We've replaced the whole fence about 5 years ago if I recall correctly (maybe 6). We split it with our neighbors (we paid half, the neighbors each paid ~1/6th).

My one neighbor has been tossing yard waste, debris, and other stuff next to his shed, which sits about a foot from our fence. The waste ended up filling the area behind his shed and it's pushing the fence into our yard. Everywhere else the fence is still standing upright.

The debris has also attracted rodents. They dug a hole in the section between the shed and the fence and it's driving my dog crazy. He is about 7 and now started *digging* for the first time, trying to get at them. I normally leave my dog with access to the yard via doggy door while I'm at work but now I can't do that because I worry that he'll manage to get under the fence. That's more of a peeve though, I guess.

I've hinted to my neighbor that his debris pile is causing issues for my dog, my yard, and the fence and I offered to help him clean up. He didn't get the hint. I tried to be more explicit and he basically said it wasn't his problem.

We spread rodent repellants around the perimeter of our yard and reinforced the fence as best we could but the debris pile is reaching well above the halfway line of the fence, so it's still tipping and I can't seem to stop the digging.

I don't want to pay for a new fence so soon (if things continue to pile up, there's only probably one more winter season in that fence). Can I at the very least let him know if the fence needs to be replaced he'll have to pay for it since it's falling due to him?

  And this one has definitely taken me the longest to complete, however I must say that this one is so underrated, it's unbelievable. I honestly think VIII is almost as good as VII! NEVER has a game let me get THIS customizable with the stats, constantly impressing me more and more throughout the entire game; Yes, yes, and yes. 

  Man, the story this time around got really dark in some places.. but it's SO AWESOME for that. FF8 was their follow up to their big breakout aka FF7, and I believe they really felt like they were on top of the world with VII, and so for VIII, they could try anything they wanted to now. It's beautiful in a way. It reminds me of how Zelda followed up on Ocarina with Majora's Mask, or how Stanley Kubrick followed up on 2001 with A Clockwork Orange. 

  Ultemecia was DEFINITELY the hardest boss in the series for me so far, and I must say, her final form is one of my favorite boss designs of any game of all time!! Absolutely terrifyingly grand..

I'm running Windows 7 (a clean reinstall, just did a reformat last month) and Discord just ran a new update this morning. All of today, I'm getting very regular freezes in discord when the window is open--it just becomes unresponsive, and whatever I had been in the middle of typing just stops showing up...for about ten to fifteen seconds, then it unfreezes and everything I had typed appears, and messages people had sent suddenly appear. It'll be fine for about 20 seconds, then do this again. Repeatedly. I was watching my processes and every time it did this, my CPU usage was jumping from around 15~20% to 60~70% for the duration. During these spikes, other programs get weird--my music in Spotify started skipping as well, for example. But when I completely close out Discord, everything is peachy keen and no problems.

I've tried completely uninstalling and reinstalling the program, but no dice. Someone suggested restoring my computer to a previous version of windows, but since I reformatted so recently there's nothing to restore to and doing a complete wipe seems a bit drastic at this point in time.

nd,"So, Saturday I visit the doctor again and decide between two doses.

I live in Japan, and med options are only Concerta or Strattera.

Concerta:

27mg:
Sorta focused but not quiiiiite there. Still get distracted, but can sorta get back on task. More productive than without the medicine.

I tidied up my apartment a few times

Helps me stay awake during the day 

Bad:
 makes me super fidgety. I bounce walk around the room, if I'm standing I bounce, rock back and forth, overall constant movement. More fidgety than when I'm on nothing 

Still daydream a lot, but with 27mg I think I talk out loud more often. Like my inhibition is slightly ..less

A few times I found myself pacing back and forth, daydreaming out loud, when I was supposed to be getting up to do something. I mutter to myself in public 

Weirdly, I also casually cuss more, but I rarely cuss in general. Like: ah this fuckin paper is wrinkled. Not good for school (work).

Had some anxiety the first day and mild anxiety a couple other random days

Still semi restless/impatient/bored when people socialize with me, but not as bad as without meds

36mg:
No excessive fidgeting or talking out loud more than normal. No cussing more than normal. Not as many anxiety days (except when I was sick and started panicking I might have the flu. I didnt)

Medicine lasts longer, so I have to take it earlier (but it's big)

Can socialize without being as restless and space cadet-y 

Bad:
Seem to hyperfocus more, and mostly on things I shouldn't. Spent like 5 hours,  3 days in a row, looking up clothes. Lots of Redditing, online window shopping, etc. At work I'm good, but at home I can't do anything useful 

Harder to switch tasks, takes me forever to pull away from a task

Worse short term memory. Like I'm so focused on X that I forget I need to shower or print something or whatever

I even forget to write reminders for myself (27mg memory not great, but I would regularly write memos to myself) 

Apartment is super messy again  because A) I forget I wanted to clean it 
B) can't stop what I'm currently doing 

Laundry is piling up for the same reason 

Staying up later than I'd like, cuz I'm focused on something useless

So, i got a new soundbar from work as a gift for the holidays.
Not really a fan of those things but when you get it for free, you'll take it ... 
So i thought i might as well use it with my mi box, but when i go to Remote &amp; Accessories and trying to add it, it just keep searching for it.
When i search it on my phone (HTC U11) it shows up immediately and connecting with no problems.

I don't recall seeing any announcement about this, or any listing in the update notes \- but this is a surprisingly pleasant change that many would appreciate. Assuming my memories aren't lying to me.

I just noticed today that **units that are in an expedition are no longer flagged as such in either arena teams nor 10 man trials**. Previously, I feel certain that arena team members that were in expeditions could be swapped out but you couldn't change their equipment. I also believe the same was true for 10 man trials. I used to keep two team configurations as spares so that I could fill out my roster for the 10\-man trials and make sure those units didn't go wandering off on expeditions accidentally. Now I don't have to do that, and it's awesome. I can make arena and 10 man trial teams with whatever units I want and gear them however I want. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

This is the difference between sitting down to do a trial and actually doing it, versus sitting down to do a trial and realizing you just sent one of the key units off on a 24\-hour NRG gathering quest because you mashed the ""auto\-fill"" button in expeditions.

I know that the current Patriarchs are allowed to live uninterrupted in modern day Istanbul, but was he semi\-revered as holy like the Pope was when Rome fell and spared?

I primarily play Talon in the Top Lane with Flash + Ignite and secondary Mid lane with the same setup. Many people have been asking me how to play Talon in the Top lane against the heavy bruiser meta as they are great counters against assassins. So, I’ve decided to start this AMA to provide strategies and tips on how to climb with Talon in any ELO. In this Meta heavily centered around the ADC and team fighting, there aren’t many individual champions that can punish this kind of playstyle. I believe Talon is one of those champions that can negate the pressure from a fed ADC due to his ability to instantly assassinate a single target.      
Talon is extremely strong in solo queue and can enable anyone to climb to Diamond Elo very easily if you spend some time to learn him. I also stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/fwiizone) and have a guide that can help anyone who is interested in playing Talon; I've heard good results from many of my viewers thus far.

But that's just minor thing since you can leave some quests for later/just wander around to hear banters/play it again, it's short (compared to Origins).
My bigger problem is that they are lost and/or forgotten in next games.

Anders: damn, I hate this guy in DA2. In Awakening he was witty and smart. He had no love for Chantry or Circle, but he didn't try to save the world, more like he wanted to be left alone. In DA2 he is sooo bitchy. If you want to be left alone, maybe next time go some place NOT known for harsh mages treating. And if you want to save the world, maybe use your Gray Warden status and friendship with Hero of Ferelden.

I've got the feeling that Velanna became Fenris. I've heard that she was planned to be GW in DA2, but they went with Anders. But this broody but can-be-funny Elf with hate to particular group of people based on extreme cases. They both are looking for their sisters. That's got to be something. Fenris was smoother, we didn't meet him just after killing bunch of mostly innocent people just to offer him place in our group, but I think it's just learning on ones mistakes. And if my theory is true, forgetting about Velanna makes some sense, but it's still sad that she is gone without any info.

Oghren isn't that much the case since Awakening developed him instead of introduce and I liked it. But some mentions about him in DA2 and DA:I would be nice.

Justice is... well, Justice, we know what happened, Howe got some time, not much but more than I've could wish - I mean, it's better than just codex note. And Sigrun is completely forgotten, just like Velanna, but without hypothetical reincarnation.

What I am trying to say is that I've really liked these guys and felt connected with them (as much as you can be connected with few models, textures and some lines of dialogues) but all we got in next games was Anders and he've changed a lot. Whole Awakening feels 
 kinda forgotten by developers."

NDad has been obsessed with my brother’s gf whom he has never met. Granted I believe my mom and I wanted to do something nice for her and her family since they stepped in to help my brother when he got a concussion (he’s abroad for school right now so we wouldn’t be there for him.)

But since yesterday my dad has been trying to force a meeting. “Would she like to do this? Would she like to join us for that?”

He shot down a plan for the afternoon because “we have plans with your brother’s gf”. We had no such plans. Bro texted her asking if she wanted to meet up with us, but she had yet to reply. 

Finally she did. We set dinner plans for a burger joint in my brother’s neighborhood. My dad later cornered my brother and said he didn’t think it was a good idea and wanted to go for some Fine Dining. 

That clicked for me. NDad is fucking obsessed with showing off his “wealth” and how “classy and sophisticated” he is. (No one else on my family gives a shit. He’s forced us to go to these obscenely fancy restaurants to be waited on and all it does is make us intensely uncomfortable.) 

It finally hit me that what he wants is to be worshipped by this young girl he’s never met, not trusting my brother’s insistence that she would not like this kind of treatment at all.

do,"I was diagnosed with ADHD this past May. I am nearly 28 and I am a female. Before my diagnosis I began struggling with serious depression and then I developed anxiety issues as well. I had been so depressed for so long, I began to wonder, what is wrong with me?

Finally, after going in to see my doctor, for another doctors note for school, he said, ""have you ever been tested for ADHD?"" And that clicked with me. At that point, even though I was registered at University, I wasn't going and I was failing classes.

When I got my diagnosis, I was given Concerta, and I began doing all sorts of research into ADHD and how to help with symptoms etc. But for a long time, and even still today, I wonder what my life could have been like if I had gotten diagnosed sooner. Maybe I would have gotten good grades, maybe I'd be able to read sheet music and play an instrument properly. And maybe I wouldn't have spent a good three years of my life sleeping, and not seeing the point in getting out of my bed.

I was also very angry with my mother, as my younger brother had been diagnosed with ADHD when he was 6 and then a little while later, diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. I recall my mother reading all sorts of books on ADHD. I even remember asking my mother if she thought I had ADHD, because I noticed I was different than others. But my mother told me, ""no, you're not like your brother."" According to my psychologist, often times if there is a child with mental health issues, parents hyper-focus on them, and things often get missed when it comes to the sibling, all because I was doing comparatively better than my brother.

So for a good few months, I was so angry with my mother. I felt like with her not noticing, that I missed a lot, because I wasn't paying attention. All she would say was, ""it wasn't obvious."" Even though I look back and think it was fairly clear.

do,"My average day is spent 9 - 10 hours using my laptop. I don't go outside, or if I do it's for fast-food, alcohol, or something awful. I have developed a nervous tic, because I know how I'm wasting my life away and it causes me so much stress that I uncontrollably just tap my foot as I browse the internet looking to fill the void (I actually busted a blood vessel in my eye from the stress / straining the other night). This is a huge issue, and I think it's a mix of procrastination, depression, and addiction. My posture is fucked up because I sit down all day long (slouched over). My body is sending me signals that it's in pain and that I need to move. I've resorted to laying down now because my body adapts to that much better. Regardless, I've become my own worst enemy and I have set up all these mental barriers in regards to changing my life for the better.

I'm so harsh on the self-criticism that I've lost desire to do normal things. I have mentally abused myself to not do anything if I can't 'do it correctly'. Therefore, nothing gets done. This has also made me overly sensitive so whenever someone gives me solid criticism I immediately take it as an assault against my existence and retreat.

In order to escape myself, I play video games. A lot. Part of me just really loves to play, the other part is just looking for an escape (either way its not improving my life). I have very little friends and do not socialize besides with my therapist. I don't have a job, either. I'm terrified of being successful, because I've never been successful and such an idea seems unnatural to me.

I have been diagnosed with depression and ADHD, but that is still no excuse as I can move my arms and legs and therefore can exercise at the very least. But no matter what, I'd rather stay behind my laptop. I'm missing out on my years of being in my 20's.

I just want to live a normal life, not anything complex. I want my own apartment. I want to be a minimalist, and to go exploring occasionally. I'd like to work somewhere quiet like a library because that fits my personality.

But no, I don't go and change, because I don't believe I deserve it for whatever reason. I've become enslaved to this mentality that I can't do anything but escape. It's killing me, I'm killing me.

Most of the SSRIs also made me feel sluggish, tired, and unfocused. I know lack of motivation, sleep problems, fatigue, etc. are symptoms of depression, but the SSRIs only made these worse, while numbing me emotionally. Nowadays, I feel like these physical symptoms are what hurt me the most.

I was a decent student through most of grade school, with parents I didn't dare disobey or disappoint (mostly scared of my dad's wrath). So maybe that's why I wasn't considered to have ADD/ADHD. But now the signs and symptoms seem very apparent to me:

I can't focus. At all. It's like my mind is running too fast for what I'm doing. I start reading some text, and before I know it, I'm skimming. I start watching a movie or TV program, and next thing you know, I'm on my cell phone or in the kitchen wondering what there is to eat. This is what's killing me in school.

I'm always tense/wound up/restless. This is one thing I've never noticed myself, but people always comment on. I'm always tapping my foot or clicking my pen or drumming my fingers on the table. If someone tries to get my attention, the response will be less like, ""oh, hi, what's up?"" and more ""YEAHWHAT?""

I cannot be organized. I cannot finish a task after I've started it. I have problems getting started on anything that I know will require more than 30 sec. of work or attention.

These are just a few examples of the 'symptoms' that lead me to believe I may suffer from a tad of the ol' ADHD.
I get frustrated with my inability to focus or accomplish things I am otherwise perfectly capable of. I get down on myself, and then I go, ""oh, geez, I'm worthless/depressed/a failure, etc."" And that's where the 'depression' comes from. I can't keep friendships, because it's hard for me to plan outings, be motivated to do anything in the first place that would require more than 5 min. of driving, or calm myself down enough to make myself easy to be around (no one likes to be around a shaky, volatile, tense, fidgety person). This also depresses me.

TL;DR - I think my depression symptoms may actually be more an effect caused by ADHD, and not the other way around.

Thanks for reading, your thoughts and insight would be greatly appreciated.

do,"I've tried so hard for so long to forget you. I did what I was supposed to and cut you out of my life. I realized just a few weeks later the mistake I had made, but I followed some shitty advice and didn't try to talk to you about it it. It was all my fault. I wasn't mature enough to handle the kind of adult relationship we had, and you are so much older than me, and I felt pressured to commit for the long haul. I didn't know what I was letting go of. I didn't know what I had until it was gone. I have only myself to blame, and I have accpeted that. Hell, when I first sent that letter, asking you to give me a second chance, I made a rule: if at any point you asked me not to talk to you any more, I would stop. Not once in the last year have you asked me not to talk to you, but I have given you space when I understood you needed it and done my best not to intrude on your life.

So why is it okay that you continue to intrude on me? You reject me again, just to start talking to me almost 6 months later? And by email, no less? But I was so desperate to talk to you that I didn't care. And I still don't, even though, after being so excited that we might be able to be friends, you just stop talking to me again. I guess I got too personal again, or something like that. But you were pouring your heart out to me, about things I know you can't talk about with almost anyone else, because you're just like me- you don't have many people you can confide in. So I was good enough to complain to, but not enough to talk to on the fucking phone? Jesus H. Christ, e-mail? For fuck's sake. At least I tried to make it more personal by hand-writing my letters, our conversation is so lifeless already.

But that's the real gem in all this- I know talking to you messes with me, and what's worse is that I never know if you're going to want to talk to me at all. Who the fuck takes 2 weeks to respond to an email? Did it take you that long to decide if you can handle talking to me this time? You're a grown fucking woman, make up your goddamn mind. I may have a laundry list of problems, but at least I do my damndest not to make them your problems. But I'll keep coming back for more, I always will. I do my best to hide this by trying to seem detached, because in reality do I have a lot going on in my life. Things aren't really that bad. The truth, however, is that I'm so fucking lonely and I miss you so much that I will keep up this friendly ""conversation"" as long as I can, just because it's the closest I can get to you. I know that's why you blew me off after I drove an hour and a half just to get coffee with you. You really wanted to see me when you called, but you lost your courage while I was en route, and didn't even have the decency to call me to cancel. You never answered your phone, so I just drove on, and it was another hour later that you bothered to text me your change of heart.

And yet I still miss you. I just wanted to see you in person. I didn't believe any more at the time that you'd give me a second chance just because I showed up, but neither of us can hide anything in person, not like we can over the phone, even, much less in text. Even if I couldn't get you to say yes, I could at least figure out why you kept saying no and maybe get some closure. But to this day, you have yet to give me one solid reason why, and I don't think that's a lot to fucking ask after you've spent so much time jerking me around.

But it's ok. I know you're conflicted, and I can't blame you for that. I broke your heart when I left. But in the last two years, I've realized what I really want out of life, and I am ready to spend the rest of it making it up to you by doing everything in my power to make you happy. Nothing would make me happier. If you don't want that, fine. Even if you don't want to tell me why, fine. But I know the reason you talk to me every once in a while is because you haven't had any more luck forgetting me than I have forgetting you. You haven't dated anyone, and straight-up lied about being interested in someone else when you first wrote me back. You still don't know what you want with your life, because even after breaking free of the chains of a career-centric life, hammered into your brain so fucking hard by your parents for so many years, you still seem to think that doing one specific thing all the time is what will make you happy. I understand the appeal, for sure. You're an amazing musician, and music will always make you happy, but it's not any less harsh than any of the other shit you've tried to do with your life, and I know that being with me made things so much better, because of how many time you told me so. You hate every new job you try, but you always loved an afternoon of MarioKart with me. Why is that so hard to see?

At least I'm willing to admit that my life feels incomplete without you. I know everyone always preaches about being happy with yourself first before trying to be in a relationship. I agree, self-esteem is essential. I didn't have it before, and that was a huge problem. I feel like I've spent a lot of time working out what it is I want from my life, and I have immense confidence in my convictions now. But being happy with myself as a person doesn't seem to ease the horrible, draining misery of spending so much time by myself, sleeping alone every night. I bought a futon just so I wouldn't notice all the empty space in my full-size bed where you should have been lying. But it didn't help. Like I said, I have plenty of stuff going on. I've got a lot to look forward to- I said it last night to one of my only true friends, and I meant it. I will carry on, even if you never talk to me again, and for a while, until I find something else to keep me going, it will be, in part, to prove to you that I am capable of making my life work, and that I am ready to be what you needed me to be. But lurking in the back of my mind will always be that knowledge, that I don't want to live my life for a career, or even a specific ideal. I want to live my life with you, raise a family, and enjoy the love we could share. No amount of hitting the motherfucking gym is going to beat that desire out of me. Hitting the bars never takes away the feeling that I'm missing a piece. I know I'm not supposed to need you or anyone else to complete me, but I fucking do. I may want a lot of things in life, but that's one of the most important things on the list. I am usually miserable by myself, but when around people I care about, I feel a million times better. Good friends have always been a better cure for my depression than the medicine. Speaking of that, I kicked it mostly because I knew it had made me numb to the emotions that should have encouraged me to keep fighting for us. I knew that it had taken away my empathy, and now I'll not have anything to do with it. Hell, when I started taking it again at the beginning of the semester last year, I stopped missing you for that long, and I stopped caring about anything, I just slept all day. Fuck that shit, never again.

So what's the use in denying it? I can't find a better cure for my unhappiness than love, and loving you was the best thing I've ever felt. If it wasn't for being with you, I don't know if I would have ever figured out why life is worth living. You gave me a reason to live. I know, if I just persevere, there will be another love, right? I just have to keep working on myself and do my best to forget about you.

It's so hard. I guess, since you won't talk to me again, I'll get back to trying. I've got miniature models to paint, beer to drink, and homework to do, anyway."
do,"Hi --

I just started a summer graduate program. It's one of the top programs in the country, and so understandably many of us have anxiety as a requisite because we want to do well. But I have particularly bad anxiety and depression, because I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in college, and had an eating disorder, and had a sexual trauma, and so I spent a lot of time either isolated or in treatment settings where social situations were easy to navigate because everyone understood one another. It is day 3 in this program, and it lasts just for the summer, and it is supposed to be a magical experience and it is highly regarded by many for its opportunities occupationally and socially/emotionally. But I'm miserable. I have been in the middle of a depressive bout for the last 3 months, and it is piss poor timing because I need to have the energy and self-worth to socialize, but I dread it and I hate it. People initiate conversation with me because they see that I'm quiet and I think they feel bad for me (because everyone else is very close already and they've made friends) ... One woman actually asked me, ""are you making some friends?"" And people talk in a babying voice to me because I look younger than most women my age, because my eating disorder led to some growth problems, and my facial features are a bit younger-looking. It is fucking humiliating, because people are feeling bad for me and my social awkwardness, while they have no clue what is going on for me emotionally/mentally, and while I have a good intellect but it can't be seen by anyone because I can't fucking get my words out or express myself.

And the worst part of it all is that I had no problem with this before I was diagnosed with a mental illness. My social skills have gotten worse over time since high school - not better. I used to be charismatic and outgoing. Now I am writing a reddit post in my dorm room while others are out on the front porches socializing with one another.

I'm fucking miserable, and I need to keep my enthusiasm up to stay in this program that is an opportunity of a lifetime... I feel desperate 80% of the day, and I don't want to talk to anyone, because every time I do, a cascade of negative, mean, harsh beliefs and thoughts come in and attack me, lower my self-worth bit by bit... And now I have very little self-worth. Grad school in this setting and in this discipline, in which I've worked very hard and have accomplished a lot, was supposed to help my already-low self-worth, but it seems to be making it worse.

Anyone else have a similar experience? Or am I developmentally flawed and immature to be dealing with this in GRADUATE school?"

I don't know much about this subject...I've always been curious on radical feminist perspectives on this.

On one hand I think I can understand how pushing for diverse default norms of beauty makes sense, because having white women be the  default for attractiveness makes things harder for women in so many different ways and results in harmful practices such as skin bleaching. 

On the other hand though, should we be pushing for the dismantling of such industries?

How can i get her out of my life?
The marriage was performed in 05495- Williston, VT. I had the paperwork all notarized and ready for submission and was talking it over with her over IM, when she reversed her intentions. can i submit the paperwork anyway and get out without her consent? or do i have to get a lawyer and wait to hear from hers?

do,"Hello,

So, I'm a cat person and have had two cats for 13 years. However, for the past year and a half or so, my family and I have been discussing the idea of getting a dog, and we decided that if we get one, it will be a Golden Retriever.

I struggle with severe BPD, depression, anxiety, OCD, ADHD, mild PTSD, eating issues, paranoia, and (unfortunately) more. Because of this, I am also interested in possibly making the dog a service dog, but I'm not sure of that yet.

We did a lot of thorough research on how to care for a Golden and we took the two cats we already have into consideration as well, and did a lot of research on how to slowly introduce them to a brand new puppy in the household. We also planned out a designated puppy area.

However, my family and I want a pure bred golden retriever. But I read that they unfortunately come with high risks of health issues, most alarmingly cancer, because they are purebred. 

My question is, if you've ever had a Golden Retriever before or have one now, how well did they do overall? How long did they live? What health complications did they face, and at what point in their lives? Do you think they'd make good service dogs?

And finally, would you suggest I just go for it and get a purebred or should I consider getting a cross or mix breed?

Any answers will be appreciated,  thanks!"

Got a question for you folks. Can someone tell me or point me to a place where I can read about the correlation of dreams and subconscious. 

I've read somewhere that in dreams you can somehow ""talk"" to your subconscious and I wanted to know how much of truth is there. 

Some context:

Recently had a lucid dream. (also it took me quite some time to get lucid, there was a tram accident in my city and I didn't realize my city doesn't have trams Irl). Either way when I was lucid right before I was about to wake up I said to myself ""the person who I care about the most stands right behind me"", and when I turned around I saw my ex, which was pretty weird considering I started forgetting about her really, and I'm wondering if subconsciously I still have feelings for her or something, I mean I really cared for her back in time but these times are long gone.

I do want to warn everyone about this scam, though: people asking you to mark your gift as received even when you haven't received your gift.

This happened to me in my second exchange. Several days after the deadline for shipping I got a message from my Santa telling me that he had sent my gift but that he had lost his tracking information. He asked me if I would mark my gift as received b/c he was worried he might get banned or whatever if I didn't do so right away. I trusted him so I marked the gift as received. Guess what? I never received a gift.

Flash forward to today. My Santa for this exchange sent me a long sob-story about how his car broke down so he had to spend a bunch of money to get it fixed. He has my gift, he swears, but he can't afford to ship it until next Friday. In the meantime he'd like me to mark the gift as received. This time around I responded with a polite message stating that I will gladly mark it as received but only when I receive it.

Currently our spending habits are that almost everything goes on credit (for simple cash back or the occasional banking of miles for a trip) and all credit cards get paid off in full each month.

She and I want me to visit her this June for a month. I'm trying my hardest to save money, seriously, saving every last penny so I can make it happen.

I really don't care about money much, but when it is something like this -money being the difference between us seeing each other again in June or having to wait longer- it is really important to me.

She won't contribute financially, and I try to understand, not outright telling her she has to help pay, but when she goes out with her friends drinking and having a good time while I'm sitting at home alone, saving every last cent I can, it's really hard for me. I want to go have fun like she does, but I am saving to visit her.

I took an IQ test as well with the same lady and I scored 130-140 for non-verbal IQ and 147 for verbal IQ. She said I'm ""gifted"", and that that's often correlated with autism, though she still wasn't sure.

As a little backstory, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 15. My mom was forced by the pediatrician to take me on that visit, but guilt tripped me into saying I didn't want to go back because she does not believe in mental health issues. So, I know what my sister is saying is true. She says that when she approached my mom, my mom told her that she just needed to ""choose to be happy."" And would not get her help. My sister said that she feels increasingly worse every day, and that she has some days where she feels like she just can't handle it anymore.

I have just started back in therapy and my therapist agrees that my issues would not be as bad as they were now if my mom had allowed me to seek treatment earlier. I do not want to see my sister go on this downward spiral that I went on, but I don't know what I can do to help. If I tell my mom what my sister said, my sister will get in trouble because I was treated very badly when my mom had to take me to get help.

Honesty, I have so much anxiety about the situation that I know that, inevitably, this will get turned around on me. My mom has even told me not to project my own issues onto my sister before. If I knew how, I would get my sister out of that house today. Unfortunately, we've already spoken with someone who said that, because she is above the age of 14 (legal age to make your own medical decisions in our state), and she has a car, she has the means to take herself and we can't take her from me mom for refusing medical treatment.

do,"First of all we've been dating nearly 2 years, and I have to say I have never met a more incredible man. He's got me out of my shell a whole deal, and has supported me through my depression and eating disorder (in his own way).

We have silly fights every now and then, as most couples do, but the main problem that keeps coming back is how with any problem at all, he refuses to talk it through. Not just changing the subject or anything, but completely ignores me for at least a day. If I text him talking about something else, he usually replies, but if I bring the problem up, Im ignored again.

This wouldnt be so much of a problem except some of the issues feel really serious to me, and if I dont talk about it, it builds up so when I get to see him in person, I usually get furious with him really quickly. He seems to STILL think after ignoring the issue for a couple of days, I'll be calm and have gotten over it, but its impossible for me to do this on a serious issue.

I have spoken calmly to him about this so many times, about how if he talked to me when we had a problem, we could sort it out, and I didnt want to talk to him just to argue and hurt him and prove Im right, but it was to actually help us (and my brain) through the problem.

He has called me immature several times about this, saying I make too much of a fuss over nothing. Being 18, I can definitely say yes, some times I can be immature, but those are about stupid things which annoy me, but I will always apologize to him quickly and mean it. It feels as if he thinks hes completely matured and knows how to run a relationship, when he completely disregards my feelings, despite what the fight is about.

ALSO, I have talked to him so many times about this its getting ridiculous. How am I supposed to get him to open up and just discuss what happened, how I feel about it, and how HE feels about it, so we can move on? Why does he feel that its okay to do whatever he wants, but whenever I do it, its a big deal and hes allowed to be annoyed and ignore me for days?

TL;DR My boyfriend cannot discuss our problems, meaning they never get solved, I end up taking in the consequences. Please help me find a way to get him to stop ignoring me?"

The main thing we're not sure about is cage size; I know that you can get them at Petsmart or wherever, but I've also read that the selection at pet stores is not the best when it comes to the welfare of the animal. I know they need multi-level cages, but what about dimensions?

Also, we've done some research about boys versus girls, but I wanted to ask a community: which would be better for first time chinchilla parents? We're planning on getting an older one (at least a few years), if that makes a difference.

do,"Hello all! I am a mother of three little ones and I've been having worries about my oldest.

Aurora is a beige hooded rat and I've had her since February of 2016. I adopted her from Pet Smart when she was already around a year old, I'm assuming around 8 months. She had been kept in the back by herself because she developed an illness early in her stay and they removed her from the other rats. In fact, the day *after* I brought her home, I woke up to a bloody cage because she had a nose bleed from an undiagnosed respiratory infection (which she was promptly taken to the vet and treated for). 

Then, back in December of 2016, Aurora had a mammary tumor removed and recovered from that, but has been keeping congestion ever since, with no antibiotics seeming to help at all despite multiple visits to the vet since, but it's not holding her back or rendering her from doing anything. She's still functioning normally.

Recently, Aurora - (she has been in a separate cage from my other two rats, as she was my first and content on her own from the start and when I got my other two and tried to introduce them recently, she was *not* about it. They were too much for her and she would hide in a corner) - has started to become a little more lethargic and doesn't seem to be eating as much. She was always a little hoarder and normally, where I would place her food would be empty, but it has been more full each day. She also has little bits of porphyrin around her eyes whenever she wakes up. I also noticed last night that she wasn't able to climb her cage as easily as she used to be able to. She's also not nearly as adventurous as she used to be. Whenever she was out roaming before, she would be non-stop everywhere, but nowadays whenever she's out, she just wants to cuddle.

Aurora is my first rat and she will be the first one I lose, whenever she goes. I was just curious on if these were general signs of old age or if she is ill. I simply want to do what's right for her.

Thanks in advance!

TL;DR: My 2 year old rat who has had a mammary tumor removed previously and has a history with respiratory issues has been acting differently; are the signs she's showing old age or signs of illness?"

do,"Hello!

My uncle recently met someone, converted to the LDS church (from the Catholic Church) and is getting married in December. My family is made up of atheists and catholics (and I'm atheist myself), so we really have no idea about LDS practices, but from what we've gathered, since we aren't mormon, we won't be allowed to see them ""get married.""

On the invite, it says that there is a reception following the vow ceremony, all of which is taking place at an LDS church. 

So I guess I'm just wondering if a vow ceremony is different from the temple ceremony? Will we get to see anything? What's the deal? This is my uncle's third wedding, and her second, does that change any of the practices?

do,"So, before I begin, I just wanted to ask you not to judge me. I feel really bad already.

There is this guy [43 M] I'm really in love with for over a year. We met on professional ground, to make it simple, but we only actually worked together once (and it wasn't for long, or, well, it wasn't a big deal at all). I have to say, I found him extremely attractive physically from the first time I saw him, even before we actually knew each other. I never thought a guy this good looking would even pay any attention to me, but then we were introduced to each other and he turned out to be incredibly sweet and kind and sympathetic towards me.

This was literally the first time in my life someone I liked this much didn't reject me, and I'm not exactly very young. Which might be the reason why I lost it completely. When he was flirting with me, I couldn't resist, and one night we ended up drinking till morning (we share a very rare passion, but even apart from that we connected instantly), and in the end we almost had sex. Almost, because, just in case, in the last possible moment, I asked him: 'you don't have a girlfriend or a wife, do you?' And he admitted he does, so... I left.

Anyway, later I found out he is actually married for many years.

The thing is, it would be logical for the story to end here, but it didn't. He wrote me an e-mail thanking me for a great evening and apologizing for his behaviour, and I replied, and we just keep on writing to each other. We don't meet that often, just once in a while, but each time this happens and I feel the way he is looking at me... I'm losing it again. I'm losing it with every e-mail I get. We are not even openly flirting, for an outsider most of our correspondence might seem like a friendly sharing of experiences and emotions. Probably the most... romantic thing that happens is when he sends me pictures (mostly artistic nudes) of girls who look very much like me. He never ever mentions his wife.

I know I should just put a stop to it, OK? And I tried. I didn't write to him once for almost a month, but I got super depressed and empty and it only got better when he started writing to me asking if I'm all right.

Then I thought maybe I should just go on and meet someone new, and precisely at that time I met someone really special [30 M]. I mean, I can rationally say that he is special; I thought, if we date for a while, maybe I will forget about my crush. What other way is there? But sadly, this doesn't seem to work. I don't feel thrilled about going out on dates, sex is good, we can discuss every topic and find it fun and inspiring, but I just keep thinking about the other guy. I really don't know what to do. I suppose I should be just honest and break up with my boyfriend, but he seems to be so engaged in it already, talking about marriage and what not (yuck!). Or maybe I should just ignore the fact that I don't feel anything for the time being, hoping that one day this will change?

Please, any advice?

The build quality of the XPS is ideal and after weighing it up against a few ASUS laptops and the Thinkpad x260, I'm definitely going with this... but which one :O?

I'm in the UK, so I'd be paying about £899 with the £50 offer thrown in.

I've been dealing depression for quite some time now, and after going through some very self-destructive times, I'm finally at the point where I live a stable life. I've been seeing a couple different therapists for a while who helped give me the motivation to go back to school, finish my degree, land a very nice job, and now I'm living the most stable life I've ever had. I've eliminated all of my sources of anxiety -- my bills are paid, I have a decent savings account, and I function just fine in my job (engineer) and in the rest of society. Everything that I had thought was triggering my depression is now gone. For a while, I was busy enough saving myself that I was able to bury it, and had probably tricked myself into thinking I had figured out how to manage it.

A while back, I was diagnosed with Schizoid Personality Disorder, which explains why I've never been able to have close relationships with anybody else and very well could've stemmed this whole thing. But as my therapist points out, simply putting a label on it doesn't do anything and there's not much to do to help it other than learning how to avoid self-destructive patterns of behavior. Being alone doesn't bother me, in fact I prefer it.

The problem is that after conquering all my demons, I feel just as cold and empty as I always have, and I'm becoming frustrated because I don't feel like there's anything else I can do about it. While therapy helped save me from destroying my life, sessions have now feel pointless. Without having goals to work towards, depression has become the forefront of my mind; it's there 24/7. I'm stuck with what feels like nowhere to go. I know that I don't want to live the rest of my life like this and was wondering if any of you had or have been experiencing anything similar and what has helped. Thank you."
do,"Something that I don't seem to understand is how everybody is already infected. This just doesn't make sense to me. It's rather obvious that the US is overrun. Dr. Jenner said that France was the last country to the stick it the longest before they lost power, meaning that Europe is overrun as well. I think at that point, it's pretty safe to say that other areas of the world (Asia, Australia, Central America, etc.) are facing the same problems due to just how interconnected we are as a world

So how does everybody already have this infection inside of them? I've heard some people say that it could have been a mutation that was always in our DNA that just randomly decide to show it's effects? That doesn't make sense... at all. Perhaps it was some type of bioterrorism? That could explain how it's world wide and affecting so many people... but that doesn't explain how it's already inside of everybody. 

This just leads me to wonder if literally EVERY person has it... ranging from an infant in Georgia, to a teenager in Japan, to an elderly person in Brazil. Also makes me wonder if it's inheritable from mother to child (I don't that Judith will be our answer to that). Will this always be a threat that society will have to deal with? Could a world like that ever go back to the way it ""was"" or do future generations always have to live in fear?

What do you all think? Is this whole idea that everybody is already infected something that could ""legitimately"" happen or is it just to make your typical zombie story a little more theatrical?"

So I had surgery in November 2016, had a temporary ileostomy and was put back together in February 2017. My doctor immediately put me on Entyvio.

Long story short I've been on it for about a year now and I feel like it's done absolutely nothing for me. I've changed my diet, which helps somewhat with symptoms, but I still get gut pain, nausea, frequent mouth sores and I'm exhausted all the time.

I'm going back to the doctor at the end of the month and I'm hoping to be put on a new medicine. What are my options at this point? I've been on Pentasa, Humira and Imuran (both of which stopped working).

do,"I was watching one of the more recent episodes of Dexter. Deb was chasing down a bad guy dressed as a minotaur. The scene was nothing but strobe lights and screaming heavy metal music, claustrophobic spaces and terror. Terror terror terror. It triggered in me an incredibly painful memory, one I was forced to relive there on the couch with my girlfriend staring on helplessly, as I rocked on the ground. 

The problem is I'm not even sure it's a real memory. But then I doubt that, like my brain is simply trying to bury it again under a veil of doubt, like it's trying to protect me from going through with it again.

Even now I'm having trouble even talking about it. If I focus on the memory of the resurface, it becomes painfully horribly real, but when I try to write it down or explain it to someone, I get lost in my own head, like there's a maze between my language center and my mouth and the idea can't escape, and all I can do is dance *around* it, talk about the scaffolding, just like this fucking paragraph. I can't talk about *it*, but I can talk about it's effects.

*If* it did, in fact, happen, it is very likely the cause of the C-PTSD I was diagnosed with at the beginning of the year, and the anxiety and depression that has wreaked havoc on my life since... elementary school, I guess. I don't know when it started. I'm riddled with issues; ADHD, depression, anxiety, and C-PTSD (although the C-PTSD may be the 'x-factor' causing all the others), and have taken medication for it all, but I can't afford my prescriptions and so I've been self-medicating with Adderall I buy from a co-worker and lots of caffeine and hobbies. So many god damn hobbies.

But my mind nags with doubt. The existence of this memory in my head is simply not enough to convince me it happened. I live with the constant fear of losing my sanity, and I am afraid that this memory might just be a symptom of the crazy I've always felt I've been veering towards.

Ever since this relapse, my life has fallen apart. I can't sleep at night, I don't eat, I don't do anything. It's a struggle to convince myself to get out of bed, and the apartment has fallen into disarray. My performance at work is sliding backwards fast, and I can't focus. Everything is muscle memory. In my body, I am no longer present. I smile, I laugh, I carry on polite conversation, but I feel like I'm only here in proxy. I'm still stuck in that labyrinth, with the strobe lights and the heavy metal music. 

I am faced with a horrific, terrible dichotomy. Either I *was* violated as a child, or I have lost my mind so far that my brain is crafting memories so vivid and real, despite being entirely fiction. What is fucking real?

I need to see a doctor. I had to stop going because I simply cannot afford it. Even with insurance, the co-pay is insurmountable (I do not make very much money). Every paycheck, after bills and rent, goes to necessities. Groceries. Car maintenance. Paying down my credit card debt. The immediate threats to my well-being.

I have no resources left over to fight this, and I'm quickly losing my mental energy. I'm afraid of nose-diving further. I'm trying to pull up, but it's like one of my engines has blown. I'm afraid I'll use this as an excuse to escape into the mental prison I built for myself in high school, and that if I backslide further I will be completely beyond saving.

I can't do this on my own anymore. I've been trying for so long to take care of my own problems, but I can't. I can't. I can't do this alone. 

I know I need to tell my girlfriend. If anyone has earned the right to know what's going on with my life, it's her. Especially since we live together, and I will be dragging her through hell while I try to solve this. But I don't want to. I can't. How could I tell her? I don't want her to know. I don't want anyone to know. There's someone I need to *look* like and I cannot compromise that. I cannot give the appearance of being something that I have not carefully constructed."
do,"So asking for a good friend of mine, since she doesn't use reddit. Does anyone know of a ROM hack that allows you to do so?

I like to sing but my voice makes people shout to me ""shut up!"" I can only learn basic phrases of a foreign language. I'm also not that social as I have a few true friends that you can count on two hands.

I tried to open up to one of my sorority sisters about how fucking depressed the holidays make me feel. Everyone around me is just mindlessly consuming and spewing bullshit about their ~favorite time of year~ and all I can think about is what a failure we are as a species. I'm part of the problem too- I work in retail and hate myself for being another cog in this disgusting capitalist machine. 

So I'm telling my girlfriend about this, trying to be honest about how afraid and angry and hurt I am, and this bitch interrupts me and tells me that I don't have anything to complain about, because I'm ""pretty."" Like, that is the sum total of my worth. Not my ideas, or feelings or pain or anything. Just being ""pretty."" That alone is enough to make me want to end it. 

Bet if I jump off an overpass and my guts spill out all over IH35 I won't be so pretty anymore."
do,"Hi, I am getting my first proper PC gaming set up going, I'm sick of using my crappy laptop so I have decided to get a proper set up. Choosing the monitor is more troublesome than looking for a PC, I don't know weather to get a 24 inch or 27 inch. I like to sit quite close to my screen, even on console I always move my chair as close as I can to my TV. I have read all over the internet that it is personal preference but I am so stuck in deciding. Can any of you give me some advice, and maybe point me towards some good modals, I am looking to spend roughly £150 on a monitor."
do,"I have been diagnosed with ADD and Depression.

While I generally feel emotionless/down, my main concern is that I think depression has slowed my cognitive abilities over the last few years. My brain just isn't turning as fast as it used to, or what it is capable of.

The main issue is that I am never able to find the words I want to use to describe what I want to say. I'm always stuck looking for a word or a way to express myself. This severely impacts my writing abilities. My processing speed and everything else is just so slow.

I initially thought these were just ADD symptoms, however the medication I take for that only has the ability of helping me focus and stay on task - It doesn't lift my brain fog much at all.

Now, I would assume that perhaps my brain is just a bit slow, however I am able to tap into a certain state of mind where words and expressions flow from my brain like I am Hemingway. My brain fog alleviates soo much and everything becomes clear.

This state of mind comes when I am super sleep deprived.

If I stay up quite late, or if I only have 3 hours sleep, I am 1000x more switched on and responsive and alert and lucid. It's all very strange. My ability to process information becomes infinitely better when I am sleep deprived.

I have since read that sleep-deprivation is a quick method to alleviate the symptoms of depression.

So is my inability to find words and think properly to do with depression, or has ADD medication fixed this problem for anyone?

Anyone who has experienced the 'euphoria' associated with sleep-deprivation allowing them to think fast and more clearly, please share your experience with how you lifted your brain fog.

I hope I will be able to replicate the state of mind in which I can speak properly and think faster because currently it really depressing to not be able to talk properly in public (unless I'm sleep deprived) because I can't think fast enough to keep up and express myself."

do,"Something that really bugs me is the wingnuts preoccupation of branding atheism a religion. I understand what they're trying to say, ""you don't believe in religion, but atheism is a religion, check-mate"". But I don't know a single atheist that doesn't believe in religion.

Religion is painfully real, we see your churches, TV programs, god bothering pamphlet junkies, your religious texts, your after school programs, we hear your doctrines, watch religious politicians on CNN... I think I can safely say, we all believe religion exists. What we don't believe in is what you worship.

""You have your religious icons such as Dawkins and Dennett, they publish your religious texts"". Surely these are real people, and yes, their books are popular amongst atheists. Twilight is outrageously popular amongst teenagers, so they're following a religion? Are dilbert readers in a dilbert religion? Does liking ice cream mean you worship it?

do,"Hi there.

I recently went back to the game after it was released, so I do not have very much knowledge about the current state of the game, nor do I have any significant wealth to buy items for.

I was looking around on the internet for fun builds to play, and I came across two that I thought looked fun:

1) Flicker Strike + Multistrike + Melee Splash

and

2) Cyclone (or any AoE attack) + Cast on Critical Strike + Discharge

Here are some examples of the builds.

1) Flicker strike: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqby9sXkIH8&amp;feature=c4-overview&amp;list=UUDer52bJZreSu0130LKOsDw

2) Discharge: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKcnuVSUU3c
or http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nNe44XUo_M
___________________________________________________________________________________________

Now I'm curious about wether or not it is possible to merge the two builds into a Flicker Striking Discharger?
The idea - as I imagine it - would be for Discharge to be the main source of damage, just like in the second video, and for Flicker Strike crits to be the trigger/mobility. 

I imagine something like this:

6L: (green) Flicker Strike - (red) Multistrike - (blue) Cast on Critical Strike - (blue) Discharge - (blue) Power Charge on Critical - (red) Melee Splash

Items: Voll's Protector (chest), Voll's Devotion (amulet), The Blood Dance (boots)

Maybe the build would start off like this as the Scion:

Now what I ask you is:

1) Can a spec like this be made?
2) How would it be made?
a) Class
b) Talent tree
c) Skills and gems
d) Items needed
e) Auras, Bandit rewards, Resistances, Defences, Flasks
3) What would the playstyle be like?
4) Is group play possible?
5) Can it play hardcore? (not that I want to)
6) Is it engame viable, can it do maps?

do,"So, I'm a 22 y/o guy and over the last couple of days I'd had about 4 hours sleep between both days and was feeling pretty crap. I get home and look in the mirror and I see the most ugly human being in the world looking back at me. I hate the way my eyes look and blah blah blah. I tell myself I'm worthless and I'll never have another woman in my life. Anyway, I got so depressed about it I just lay on my bed out of self pity and ended up falling asleep until almost midnight. I wake up, go to the bathroom and look in the mirror, and now I see an attractive young man looking back. Now I feel silly, because just a few hours ago I was the ugliest person ever. I'm guessing I either A) looked shit because I was so tired or B) thought that I looked shit because my brain was so tired.  Either way I'm glad that's over with, anybody else experience similar things when they aren't sleeping much?"
do,"I'll try and make this make Some sense, but quite honestly I'm not in a state where I'm sure anything I say makes any sense right now. I'm sorry.

Some background. I am 25 years old, and at age 13, after a traumatic event that I don't care to put into words, I was diagnosed with depression, ocd and severe anxiety. Growing up was hell for me. I don't feel like I had a life. I feel like I was robbed of my ""golden years."" my dad is a psychologist, and it was an absolute blessing to grow up with such a supportive family, but I am still an absolute mess.

I've been through multiple different types of therapy. Some of them helped in the short term, but never stuck. I had a psychiatrist who constantly played with my dosage on my medication. I am on zoloft and have been for a long time because it seemed to help the best. Currently I am on zoloft, lamotrigine and klonopin. 

I struggle very badly from derealization and depersonalization. I am in a borderline abusive relationship. My girlfriend does not take my problems seriously, and shows all signs of being a manipulative and abusive person. 

I don't remember anything. The drugs I'm on absolutely destroy my memory. I don't remember my life. I don't remember what happened when it with who. My life seems like a big blob of experiences that I can't place at a point in time.

I self medicated with pornography and found myself in a very dark place because of that for years and I've never been able to talk about it in therapy. I did some things that I can't forgive myself for. I hate myself for it. 

My girlfriend and I just signed a year long lease together. I haven't even been able to begin packing and we have to be out of our current house in ten days. 

I don't have a life anymore. I am dependant on my girlfriend. I don't have friends. My girlfriend has convinced me that my family is no good for me. I fell for it and I believed her.

I feel nothing but a deep pain and hopelessness. A couple nights ago my girlfriend and I broke up during a fight. I took an extra klonopin, chugged some beers and went for a walk. I ended up standing in front of the ER contemplating commiting myself for suicidal thoughts. Next thing I remember is sobbing in bed with my girlfriend holding me and telling me everything would be okay. I guess she came and got me when I told her where I was. 

She accuses me of purposely ignoring the things she needs me to do but my memory is so destroyed and my connection to reality so damaged that I literally cannot remember the things I want to. I can't write my music anymore. I can't enjoy anything. I'm struggling at work. I'm having horrible dreams. For some reason that I can't explain it feels like the end is right around the corner. I don't know how else to describe it. 

She degrades me and calls me horrible names when I do something wrong. If I do a chore wrong I become an infant in her eyes and she babies me while insulting the fuck out of me. 

This may be entirely incoherent and I'm sorry if it is. I'm just not sure what to say or how to word it. I'm not thinking straightanymore"
do,"I had my first period at 9 years old. I'm 20 years old now and my cycle has never been regular. Because I'm still a freshman in college (kasi patapon ako), I still live with my parents who are devout Catholics - and I'm sure you know how devout Catholics can be. They don't want me to see an OB because it's *immoral*, they literally want me to pray away the irregularity of my periods. I had my boyfriend arrange an appointment with an OB anyway without their knowledge and learned that I have PCOS. The OB wouldn't give me a prescription unless I got an ultrasound which is out of the question since I can't pay for one (and alam ko naman na bullshit lang yon at gusto lang nilang makakuha ng extra money).

do,"Hi there,

First off I'd like to apologise if this has been covered or is in the wrong subreddit, I wasn't able to find much from searches (reddit and google).

I've only recently heard about Bitcoins and they seem like pretty good investment, but I have literally no idea how to start out, what to do, etc... I have a reasonable knowledge of PC's (hardware and software) and I have a pretty high end gaming rig and laptop - I read that you need good equipment. (Can provide specs if needed)

So, the question I have is pretty simple, and probably makes me look like a fool, but how do I start up in the Bitcoin Business/Bitcoin Mining small scale and then (hopefully) build up?

Thanks! And again sorry if this is somewhere else.

**EDIT**: Well I feel a bit stupid, there is a link in the sidebar. But anyway, while I'm reading that could I possibly still get a few tips?"
do,"I was diagnosed a year ago with ADHD and anxiety and I never would have considered my self depressed (with the exception of the teenage angst shenanigans I experienced almost a decade ago) until just recently. Eight months ago I began experiencing pain in my shoulder that was because of a pinched nerve in my neck due to a few herniated discs. I was told by a doctor that I have degenerative disc disease (which isn't actually a disease but just more or less says that I'm 20 with the neck of a 85 year old woman). 

My psych doctor took me off of Zoloft and put me on Cymbalta; I wasn't looking for a change but she believed that the Cymbalta would help more with managing my pain so I trusted her. After a month and a half spent on the medication I told my psych doctor that I wanted to changed for a series of reasons including mainly nausea and always being tired. Even with a red bull and a dosage of ADHD medicine (Focalin) I still felt groggy and couldn't focus enough to do my job or school work. With my insurance Cymbalta cost me $50/month and I had to pay for doctors visits and Rx nausea medication. My doctor cut me from 60 mg/daily to 30 mg/daily three days later while working I felt like I had been struck by a freight train. With drawl side effects included nausea, tingling and pins and needles all over my body, depression accompanied by fleeting suicidal thoughts, a migraine with photo sensitivity, and the next day vomiting (even while at therapy). Also I became a grade a bitch because I felt like ass and couldn't handle it. My therapist told my psych doctor that I was sick in her office due to the withdrawals from Cymbalta; to which my psych doctor replied that I only didn't like the medicine being so expensive. Due to my psych doctors complete lack of apathy and absolute refusal to work with me I decided it was time to consider a new psych doctor that may even feign giving a fuck about me. The issue is to remain at the same practice and to have a psych doctor that may, hopefully, work with my therapist I needed to wait a month to see a new psych doctor (which will be Wednesday). During my past month of living in medical limbo I had attempted to find a GP (general practice) doctor who told me that I should lose weight and go on a diet as well as give up on living on my own. I am 5'4"" and weigh just under 140 lbs; I've gained almost 20 lbs due to the opiates (including Percoset and Vicodin) that were written for my pain as well as multiple courses of steroids to help with my neck, along with the change in lifestyle where I've got  no energy to be out and active like I used to be. Also I come from a broken home and moving back into a abusive household would likely undo everything I've done thus far in therapy.

My boyfriend has been the only thing really keeping me going and he's probably the only reason I've gotten out of bed most days. He has been breaking open the Cymbalta capsules and helping me work down very slowly I've only been able to reduce by 15 mg/day in the four weeks I've been working down. I'm wildly depressed and may be out of hope. If anyone has a similar story and wants to share theirs, any words of wisdom/encouragement or what they did I'd love to hear it.

TL;DR Shitty doctors, medication withdrawal, new found depression, need some hope please &amp; thank you"

I say 'cousin' as she is my actually cousin's wife. We have no blood relations whatsoever. A few days ago, we and our family were sitting outside in out padio (uncle and cousin's live right next to us and some few minutes away). The topic of education came amongst us. To make it short....i was unintentially called stupid to go to college/university. Thinking about, I probably.

I graduated high school about 2 years ago. Since then, I've been working at grocery store deli. I hate it. In elementary school and high school, I always had problems. Math and Reading (although I overcame reading and am WAY WAY better) was pretty difficult for me. I believe I was diagnosed with learning disabilitiy (in math). They sent me to what is basically classes for dumb people. It was only in grade 10 that I ask to switchover to ""regular"" people class. I graduated with the bare minimum.

Know I want to go to college for Computer Science. I have to upgrade my high school because I did such shit. I know couple programming languages (Java, Python) and learning another.

Everyone fucking compares me to my brother. He's has a science degree and is on his way to med school. Sometimes to my other cousin who is a year younger but on a similar path as my brother. I angers and saddens me that I'm compares to others.

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder when I was 16 and it hasn't been the easiest thing to live with...I felt like my parents didn't understand and my friends weren't there for me. Or at least that is what it felt like. I was lonely, scared, tired, and at times I questioned if life was even worth living.
   A few weeks ago my beautiful English teacher noticed that I wasn't doing well and spent her free time at the end of the day just talking to me. We talked for a little over an hour and it felt so amazing to finally have someone listen to me. This has been going on now since the middle of November. She has made me so happy and I feel so loved....I owe her my life. She has given me happiness and held me when I let my barriers fall. This woman is the kindest, most selfless person I have met and I am just so thankful to have her in my life.
   So how do I properly thank her? I always tell her thank you and write her notes but it just doesn't feel like it is enough. I want to show her how much I love her and how grateful I am for all the time she has spent with me but I really don't know how."
do,"This is going to be long. Im sorry but I will try to summarize as much as I can. I have no one to talk to. My boyfriend and I have been together since middle school, I am 23 now; so a very long time. As you can imagine there have been quite a few ups and downs. I dont really care about the stuff in middle school because we were so young, and things happen but when we started the later years of highschool and now college and moving in together is what hurts me the most. To start, in highschool he would be constantly talking to other girls some of which I think could constitute emotional affairs, when I would try to leave he said he would kill himself ( abusive) but I was young and in love and stayed. This went on for a period of time and it stopped when he moved in with me when we were 19. Since we moved in together I found a picture of a girl from his work on his phone ( that he took) and him looking at apps such as Tinder. As you can imagine I was heart broken, and my already low self confidence is even lower. In between starting college and now I developed severe anxiety and depression as has he; this causes an even more tumultous relationship. The things I listed are only some of what I have experienced but this post would go on for days if I listed everything; it has all been mostly emotional cheating. I am very very insecure now ( I didnt use to be) , I am very jealous, and controlling and I feel crazy. Everytime I bring up something that makes me uncomfortable my boyfriend freaks out on me and says I need to start trusting him already and I try to explain to him trust takes years to re-build and the last incident was only a couple of months ago but then he goes into suicidal rage. It is so fucking hard for me to deal with my depression, his depression, and my trust issues. I told him he needs to stop threatening me with his life because I dont do that to him even though I have depression. I am writing this right now for what seems a petty reason, but to me it is not. So I am going to divulge something that might give me away to people who know me but oh well. So we live in Las Vegas. My boyfriend is going to school to be an EMT and eventually a firefighter. The whole reason I am writing this post is because he has been doing his ride alongs and as you can imagine being at many clubs , hotels, etc. I dont know if you guys have been to Las Vegas but yeah a lot of partying going on women etc. I am on the verge of tears every time he is out doing this but I  know in my brain he is 'working' but he has broken my trust so many times I have none left. He makes me feel crazy when I try to bring it up. He said "" this is why I dont want to do anything with my life because you act like this"". I get that I can be frustrating but why cant he see how sick this makes me feel. I feel physically ill and disgusted because I feel like he is just playing me . Instead of being caring and understanding he just gets angry with me. I am just at such a loss. On one hand, I know this relationship is very unhealthy but please understand this is my life partner of 10+ years; it is not easy for me to just leave. I do not know what to do and I do not have anyone to talk to, please help me. 

tl;dr Been with SO for 10+ years, he is starting a career that , because of where we live, is making me really anxious due to his past infidelities."
do,"I have tried to break up with my boyfriend at least three times in the last two years, each time he convinces me that we are ""meant to be"" and that he's doing everything he can to better his situation, however even though he changes things for a while everything inevitably goes back to how it was before. 

One of the biggest reasons I can't stand him is his tendency of just ignoring me for days when I'm angry in the hope that when he talks to me again my feelings will have magically disappeared. He recently did this after I called him out (very angrily) on still living with his parents even though he has been saying for the last three years that he is ready to move out. He ignored me for five days, and then sent me a normal ""good morning"" message with a vague reference to our argument. I have intentionally not oppened this message and only know what it says from the notification on my phone.  

Since I've tried so hard to break up with him, should I just take this opportunity to just ignore him and let things end that way? Or should I respond and tell him that it's over? I know that facing him in person won't work and I absolutely 100% want to break up.

Full Story:


I was diagnosed with depression very young, about seven or eight. It was horrible. I was put on a medication that made me gain a ridiculous amount of weight, made my depression worse, gave me panic attacks and made me sleep over twelve hours a day. The lousy therapist I saw never listened to me when I said that they didn't work so he always upped the dosage until I was taking horse pills every day and got bad stomach aches. I tried to refuse taking the medication but my mom force fed me it in pudding so I started to fake getting better.


The doctor believed me and I was weaned off of them, I don't know why he thought I was suddenly healed by God after a year but he was off his rocker just as much as I was.


I had problems with school, I threw up in the mornings, cried under my desk and didn't do my work. I was put in the special ed. class. It was the second worst experience of my life. It was problem kids stuffed into a spare room and given a child tamer, there were severely autistic and violent kids, problem kids with mental problems like me,trouble makers and one or two pure sociopaths, I even sat next to a another girl who was put in for stabbing another kid in the jugular with a pen. I used to get into fist fights with a boy twice my size (partially my fault) but we had a love/hate relationship and had our moments.


The teachers were cruel and didn't understand about my panic attacks and depression, I had to speak to a school therapist who once told me during a panic attack that I had to 'dry my crocodile tears and get up' or they would send me to school filled with kids like the special ed. kids eight hours away from my mom and home. The only reason I stay was because of the special ed. teacher and the boy I fought with and I even got put in a regular fourth grade class.


The fourth grade teachers were horrible and shouldn't have been teachers, they had zero patience. My regular teacher frequently screamed at kids and my math teacher called me in once to clean the desk I sat at because a boy had drawn all over it. I had to clean it off in front of a class of thirty kids and a teacher, they all just stared at me and I still can't do anything in front of more than three people.


This was the straw that broke the camel's back and my mom pulled me out for home schooling, which I did until I tried to go back for sixth grade. I thought the fact that I would be switching classes would be enough to distract me but I only lasted two or three weeks until I had to be pulled out again. I now wish every day I had stuck it out, I was starting to make friends and my teachers were cool but I still got panic attacks and my depression crept up on me.


I sank deep into depression, every day past by in a haze. It felt like I was dead, I couldn't distinguish between day or night, time melted together, it was like I didn't exist. I barely showered and my hair grew extremely long but I didn't care.


Until a few months ago, I woke up one day and realized I was alive. I almost cried. I had left the world as a nine year old and woke up one day as a fourteen year old. I don't have social skills, I don't know how to do my make up, I don't know how to do my hair. I would have been learning to do these things when I was eleven or so but when I was eleven I was heavily medicated on pills and trying to figure out how to kill myself as painlessly as possible and hoarding box cutting blades in secret hiding places in my room, I still find them sometimes cleaning my room and it makes me cry every time.


I got my hair cut back to my shoulders, how I remember it, I'm learning to do my make up, it's a slow process but YouTube and r/makeupaddiction has helped a lot, and my lost social skills are slowly being regained, my number of facebook friends has skyrocketed and I try to talk to everything and everyone but I'm still scared and shy.


It was going beautifully, I reconnected with my old best friend and am starting to talk to an old friend that moved (my other old friend is high and mighty now, you know what it's like, some girls just become bitches over night). Unfortunately my depression returned with vengeance this past month and I'm terrified, I've never felt as happy and normal and confident as I have these past few months and I don't want to go back to how I was. My last friend has been getting a little annoyed and frustrated with me lately, I can't blame her much, we barely know each other any more and I'm shoving this down her throat suddenly.  I never realized how miserable I was until I was shown happiness, I never realized how content I was to have accepted suicide as an eventual inevitability.


My uncles have no friends, they self medicate and dropped out of high school and work bad jobs. I still have some hope, I have three years of high school and college left before I admit defeat.


I'm going to a therapist I've chosen for myself with my mom's help but the appointment is January 2 so it's a little far away and I'm scared of what I may do or may happen before it comes around, I can't handle losing the friends I have again. The high school I'm dead set on going to is the best in my city for special needs kids, they can even put all your classes in the same hallway if you need them and are very understanding, this and the fact I'm going to a therapist soon makes me a little more confident of being able to do it but if you've ever been to therapy you'd know that sometimes you some of the things they ask you to do sound good in theory but are impossible in real life. I need some advice and a little experience form people who've actually done it.


So I've come to you for advice. Do you have any coping tips for high school? Any ways I can keep up on my appearance and hygiene when I can barely drag myself out of bed in the morning? Any tips to help me make and keep friends and talk to people?"
do,"Hi Everyone,
                    I'm working on my second degree in computer networking (first was music). I started it last August and I'll be graduating this December. I have an interview for an internship this coming Thursday at a firm that deals with taxes and accounting. They also have a technology consulting arm. They handle everything remotely with issues their clients might have. I'm just wondering what type of technical issues they might ask."
do,"I'm a senior at my high school and I'm in the process of starting a crochet club at my school.

I started with knitting about a year ago, then switched to crochet 6 months ago and haven't looked back! I've finished a couple shawls and scarves, amigurumi(my fav!), and I have 2 WIP blankets. I've also dabbled in halter tops but I dont think they turned out that good. 

So far 12 of my friends have signed up for my club, with only 2 of them knowing how to single crochet. I'm looking for tips on teaching the rest of them crochet! I've gave them a paper that describes what type of hook and yarn they should get, but I'm lost on how I would go about teaching a large group crochet. 

Also we're allowed to advertise by hanging posters around the school and I was wondering if anyone has crocheted around a piece of paper. Would you just hole punch the paper and crochet into it? What stitch is used? 

Thank you!"
do,"Was talking to a friend earlier today and we realized that we (Hufflepuffs) have only dated Gryffindors so far. Which is really... odd?

It clearly doesn't matter what house the person belongs to if you love them, but still. Fun little thing."
do,"So one of my best friends and I always tell each other we want to hook up with a girl to see what it's like and just experiment. We want to skinny dip together, we've masturbated in the same bath hot tub side by side , and lately I've been wanting to kiss her, but don't know if I should? I feel like we always imply these things towards each other, I know I do, but I don't know if she feels that way? I don't have feelings for her, so I don't want her to feel like that right away. Although I'm sure she knows that already. 

I guess I would just love to hear some stories or pointers from when you first had girl to girl interaction. Is it really freakin awkward or does it come natural and you just go with the flow?

Thanks for any input you have to offer xo"
do,"So I [21F] recently entered into a relationship with this really great guy [28M]. He's totally sweet and supportive and understanding. A breath of fresh air after some of the relationships I've been in. He makes me laugh and he cares about me and my life. But he's been through the ringer as well; been lied to, cheated on and used for drugs and concert tickets. We've tried to talk about it and he said he doesn't see any of that in me, that I make him feel different than anyone else. 
Anyway, hes still fearful I'm going to hurt him. I've tried to tell him I'm not like those other girls, that I'm me and I would never do anything to hurt him, but he still doesn't understand I guess. Here are some of the things he does:

 1.) If I've been on my phone he always asks me what I'm doing. Usually with a smug tone.
2.) Hes accused me of going over to other guys houses and texting other guys.
3.) Always asks me if I'm okay or if I'm mad at him. I assure him that everything's fine everytime.
4.) Thinks that I'm not into him anymore if I'm little too quiet one day (I'm an introvert and I've told him that).
5.) Doesn't like the idea of us spending time apart, he gets moody and thinks I hate him. 
6.) Right after entering the relationship, financials were immediately handled by him, my money and his money became our money.
7.) Can be very forceful, talks to me like he's my dad.
8.) If I want to go out with my friends, he gets pissy since I don't want to go with him.

I'm sitting in bed right now after I stayed up a little later than he did, just browsing Facebook on my phone. Last night 
""...what are you doing?"" 
Me: ""Facebook, like I said"" 
""oh okay""
20 minutes later: ""Late night friends huh?""
Me: ""what?"" 
""Who are you talking to?""
Me: ""..I'm not talking to anyone, I'm on Facebook."" 
Doesn't say anything and turns back over.
He also got mad at me for sleeping under a different blanket after I explained to him that he had taken all the blanket so I just grabbed the other one. And and he had been farting all night and he said earlier yesterday that I give off a lot of heat when I sleep so we couldn't even cuddle for that long anyway. I thought he was asleep, I didn't see any problem with what I was doing. 
Help please. I'm not sure how to convince him I'm into him and that I'm not lying."

Anyway,
I did a lot of research and I got a lot of information but I don't seem to know...

All three of these are supposed to help with depression and anxiety, some help balance the seretonin levels, some produce more, some need to be taken with a multivitamin because of the B vitamins and Folic acid...

I'm confused on which I should try first, or If I can mix any of these...Also if anyone has any experience with taking these supplements, could you elaborate on your own experience with them?? Also if you know of a better supplement that has helped you, please share."

I've had a lot of jobs over the past 3 years because adulthood sucks and I've been doing whatever I can to survive and pay bills. Each job has obviously taught me a great deal. However, listing 10+ jobs from the last 3 years doesn't look so good. So I thought I'd focus on the big skills I have because that's more flexible (and helpful if I'm changing career gears). I've found a lot of tips, but I'm having trouble with it.

do,"So, from my understanding, MAOIs/SSRI combos are dangerous because the MAOI potentiate the effects of the SSRI and may end up in setonin syndrome.


Now, taking two SSRIs or a large dose of one may also cause serotonin syndrome because of the added effects.


Now, IRL, I sometimes see psychiatrists combining two serotoninergic ADs (like two SSRIs, or SSRI/SNRI), but the use of SSRI with MAOI seems to be a much bigger deal.


The risk for serotonin syndrome is really higher in the MAIO/SSRI combo than the SSRI/SNRI combo, or a SSRI overdose? If so, why?


Bonus question: is ther risk the same for SNRI/MAOI? I'm guessing year because the SNRI is still inhibts the reuptake of serotonin, which seems to be the problem in the first place."
do,"So I'm gonna try to summarize my story the best I can.  I have autism, and was diagnosed with depression in 2009.  I attribute this to me being brought out into the adult world after I graduated high school.  In high school I lived in a bubble.  When I graduated my friend tried to hook me up with a girl, whom I started to like but she ended up hooking up with another guy.  Me, being new to all these different emotions, had a mental breakdown and tried to cut my throat. I was hospitalized for 72 hours and my psychiatrist and I talked and I was diagnosed with severe depression. My great grandparents both passed away in 2009, and I attempted suicide again on New Year's Eve, 2010, feeling alone and unworthy of love, despite my parents and family being wonderful support system.  5150d again and I begin outpatient treatment afterward for 2 months.  In 2011, I tried to get back into dating, and for two weeks it went fine till the girl I was seeing hooked up with my friend.  I lost it.  I put my fist through the wall and feeling guilty about my parents having my 9 month old brother taken to my aunts house(I love my brother dearly, wouldn't lay a hand on him, I decided to punish myself and cut my wrist, and was 5150d again.  2011-2015, I got so frustrated at my virginity and my failure with women, I joined the incel community.  Terrible idea but it's where I was at the time.  2014, I was 5150d AGAIN for posting suicidal ideation.  I did leave the incel community after I thought to myself, ""my great grandma and my family see my true nature as a caring individual as I often put others before me. ""So I am using that to develop myself to become a healthy man.  My problem is my loneliness and feelings of unworthiness.  I am in stable meds and I do like my meds.   I always dream about getting married and having a family but my path until 2014 was very rough.  I am a work in progress. Long post I apologize but this is the first time I put my full story out there."

do,"We've known each other for a little over month and a half, and have realised that we've a lot in common. We've also fallen madly in love with one another (yea, maybe it's a little quick). The relationship has it's challenges, but we're overcoming them. 

We've talked about it, but I've never seen the age gap as a real issue.Today when I told my Parents about her my mum was shocked by the age gap. She was saying things like how she will want to get married and have kids before I'm ready for it, but what she doesn't know is that I think I'm mature enough now...

do,"Hi everyone!
I'm an Android newbie and I was considering buying the Asus Zenfone 2. I actually wanted the 6P but after a few monetary considerations (broke college student, lol), I decided on the Zenfone 2.

Then I saw a deal on Amazon for a new Nexus 6 (Motorola Nexus 6 XT1103, if it helps) for the same price. I've been on the Windows Phone platform for way too long and so I'm not that well versed with how the phones stack up performance-wise on Android in real time usage, especially since the Asus has an Intel Quad Core Atom processor while the Nexus has a Snapdragon 805. I know that the Intel chip is 64-bit but how that translates into better real time usage is something that I don't know as well.

So if someone can tell me which phone would be a better buy or if I can get a couple of reasons to help me choose one phone over the other, Mr. Android Newbie would really appreciate it!

Thanks!"
do,"I feel like there are a bunch of people out there who have been affected by depression/thoughts of suicide who aren't able to share their stories. Please share your story not only for your sake but for the sake of those people out there who are wondering what they have to lie for anymore. 

My grandfather took his life when I was around ten years old, back then I didn't think much of it. I still don't know much about the situation, but I assume he was suffering from depression, something that I struggle with. Recently I have begun to wonder what life would look like were my grandfather still alive and I also want to help those who are struggling with thoughts of suicide. Hang in there."
do,"I interviewed for a Library Associate (Adult Services/Programming) position in the library system I work in. I interviewed for the position last week and was offered the position yesterday. I had said I was still interested in the position during the phone call and was told they wanted to offer it to me. 

Now, that I've had time to think about it, I don't want the position anymore. It helped me realize what I really want to do in the library system and now I may go and get my MLIS for Youth Services since that's what I've mainly been doing for the past two years although I have dabbled in Adult Services/Programming a bit.

Is it bad that I have now changed my mind? In one hand, this helped me realize what I now want to do and I haven't received or signed the acceptance letter yet. Part of me feels bad because I took the time to apply to the position and interview for it and knew what would go into the job and that if I declined that I could have wasted their time, but on the other hand it made things a lot clearer for me job/future wise. Plus, even though I interviewed for it I still plan on applying to other jobs that pop up in the system to become a Youth Associate, especially at the new library branch that will be opening by the end of the year.

Or maybe, I'm overthinking all of this because I'm a people please and have never really turned down a job offer because I could use the money but I may also have a slight problem to saying No. This ended up with me hating two of the jobs I used to have due to being taken advantage of and other reasoning (not in the library system)."

do,"Hey everyone I just joined reddit, sorry for the long windedness of this. I need to say every word. I know this might sound goofy to some people but it's been dehumanizing to live with.Not many people know about this and no one in my family does. I'm going to try to help you understand what I mean by this.

Imagine Growing up and when people find out you're always being humiliated and shamed regularly, told your worthless by girls and guys and you're just a pathetic joke, will never be felt and no would would ever want you. I knew something wan't right with my by around 10 or 11 but soon I began feeling like a freak and very ashamed. Sucks a bit I must say but thats manageable. I was also very, very small in middle school and high school in general too. With these two not so awesome things I was abused a fair deal physically and verbally because it was great fun for bullies and a lot of somewhat shallow girls. I could fight hands but the words and hate did way more damage. 

I got used to always being picked last for anything, talked down to and more and more alone but again it was do able. I remember starting to feel super self conscious of myself due to this abnormality, becoming withdrawn I even felt ashamed because I still liked girls a lot even though maybe I shouldn't. It also was hard not receiving any real affection from anyone but my mom for the most part during those years but again manageable for sure. When I was younger even around my mom and sister and they will talk about how pathetic and hilarious a small penis is on a male and he's not even a man sometimes. It made since to me actually at a certain point.  Since I was too humiliated to ask for help I never received any. It's not too bad, many people experience worse than this stuff though like some friends I have when they were that age. (rape, addiction parental death etc..)

Heres were things get more complicated. Because of these things always happening along With other stuff I simply just started valuing myself less. Not having much respect for myself, any self esteem or thinking I deserved what other people deserve even though deep down I fucking yearned for it. I didn't even know it but I had developed diagnosable and treatable depression by I was around 13 or 14 and wasn't acting like other kids and not talking much.

Fast forward I found things I enjoyed and had some nice friends through high school. These things were ingrained and haunted me though and grew. I guess tormented me here and there. I still struggled with what I didn't even know was depression and I was spending way too much time always alone feeling really tired. 

After enough stuff happening I would try to repress any attraction to girls and any need for love for obvious reasons as well as not feeling worthy of it. I didn't know it either but by 17 my depression was much worse. I was using drugs (mainly just weed at the time) to make myself feel normal regularly. I would not have any text book major depression symptoms when high. Also I would get as high as I could and then go off to a fantasy land where I would pretend more than anything there was a girl that loved me unconditionally and she would put her arms around me, I felt safe and warm next her and she valued my life, I wanted someone to love me so but knew  it was more of a fantasy. 

It's a bit frustrated that if you even try talk about this openly you're immediately looked at as really funny and almost a freak. It's not like it's something I asked for or could fix at the gym.

It's hard for me when you're messed up and traumatized and all you want is someone to love you but you think your just too damn worthless and you know no one ever will. I guess I had sorta been taught and experienced since day one no women in the right mind would want you. I would think no matter how much I loved a girl to the point where I would die for her I will always be thrown away. With some other stuff that happened like a sudden family death, having my best friend accidentally OD in front of us, and living alone far away from my family I was kinda numb. I had no ability to cry for some reason for a long time. Also I knew I had some depression but since I had it for so long I didn't realize it was at a clinical level.

The desire for sex was only about 5% as strong as the desire to be loved after all this shit has happened. I just wanted to be loved more than anything. I found a girl (not many girls at my school) and I though it might be someone where we could love each other for the first time as we grew closer. After not too long It turned out she wanted a real man that was at least average and wasn't the same height as her 5'6 so that kinda messed me up more and couldn't feel any more emasculated. She felt like she's with a boy. All that did is was real confirm everything I'd already knew but tried to push away. I don't hold a damn thing against her in the end and fully respect her preference and choices as another person. It's Darwins theory of Sexual Selection at work. It's not like women are being dicks on purpose, just got a bad genetics.

After a year of college I had to leave because my depression became crippling to where I could not function much and I was diagnosed with moderate to severe major depression and began getting help. It felt like having the flu 24/7. sometimes stuff is in slow motion, you can't eat and everything is just black etc. I could take adderall and still be exhausted. In other aspects of my life I was a badass at what I devoted most of my life too but that was all gone so a lot of my identity was too.

Even when I was back home I had so much hate for myself, felt so empty and numb. Plus I guess someone I loved so much was really, really hurting me and making me think I'm even more of a worthless piece of shit then I already thought I was. I would cut and burn my self a lot because I thought I deserved it, it made me feel better, and it would help be stop crying or being catatonic. Also struggled briefly with drugs for the first time in 3 years and the depression was so serve basic function became really, really hard. I ended up attempting suicide because I didn't feel human anymore and wanted the pain to stop.

Fast forward to now which is about another year later here I am around a year later. Even now I still hear so much hurtful stuff about my body from people online and media but it doesn't bother me as much which is cool. That bad part is my depression has been treatment resistant but I'm still getting help. I guess from so much depression, trauma and trying to repress love (maybe when it's needed most too) and being isolated I almost shot myself in January, I was put in a lockdown treatment place for depression and meet someone cool.

I meet a girl who's been through the same kind of stuff just like me and we really clicked. She even had the same exact scars as me and we got close. At a point when she would stare into my eyes for too long the feelings of compassion and love were so overwhelming and she was so beautiful I couldn't repress them and I would end up crying for the first time in a while and really hard because it was overwhelming while starring into each others eyes. With the beautify is was also painful as hell because what I was gazing into felt like something I could never have and I'd begin crying even harder. Like so hard I almost threw up once but thats another story hahaha.

I also meet people who had been through the same stuff and one time tell told me all this stuff (depression, trauma) isn't my fault and I'm a good person and they care about me (more stuff has happened to me then the stuff in this post but thats not for now). I really, really didn't want to hear it and about 10 people went around and said stuff like that and at the end I was crying the hardest I've ever cried.

Heres my last thing I want to say. I've learned from reddit my problem isn't as bad as I thought a little. But I hear so much stuff on reddit (and other places especially) about people on talking about people with small dicks like were are worthless objects and not people and should stop breeding. I hear people say some nasty cruel things I want them to know you're talking about a fucking human being thats has emotions too. Most of us will never have families and stuff and are use to being thrown away, treated like shit and humiliated to the point of almost vomiting and suicide already. Please stop at least for a little at least. I know all this already. 


You don't have to love me or even like me at all, I just ask I get treated as another person just like you. I completely understand women's preferences and I totally respect them as I said. I'm not one of those annoying insecure dudes out to convince reddit size does not matter and women who need big dicks are just shallow and all that generic stupid shit you hear on hear sometimes. I'm just want people to know what this can be really like. There is nothing fucking funny about this and how emasculating it can be.

We are all people and should treat each other with love and respect at the end of the day even though thats a little far fetched. I know this whole thing may not make sense to some and stupid to others but I just wanted to get this out. I'm getting stomach pains thinking about this and will likely commit suicide in the future but it is what it is. Makes no difference. I just want this brutal depression to stop and feel love.

do,"I met this guy named Daniel on OK Cupid, the dating app. We had been talking for awhile, and eventually I agreed to go on a date with him after a week or so. Originally I was hoping to meet somewhere in between (he lives an hour away), but he insisted that he wanted to show me this house he and his boss had been working on renovating (I love houses), so I agreed to meet in his hometown.

So the day comes up that we're supposed to meet up, but this snow storm hits. I'm not comfortable driving in winter weather, I got into a very bad accident last year around this time due to winter weather and have very bad anxiety about it. I contacted him to talk about rescheduling, and he was adamant about not rescheduling. I told him that I wasn't comfortable driving in the snow, and he said ""I'd really rather not reschedule."" Which was weird, but I just responded with ""Well, better safe than sorry!"" 

About an hour later, he texted me and said ""It looks like it has stopped snowing in your area, so you can come now."" I was pretty pissed off that he completely disregarded my feelings about it, but I was so annoyed that I decided to go meet him so that we could at least meet up. So I took my phone and gps'd to the Chipotle where we were supposed to meet. 

Apparently, I went to the wrong Chipotle. There are two in the city he lives in, and I went to the one on the South side. My phone was at 10% by that time, it doesn't hold a charge very well. Well, after some conversation with Daniel, I realized I was at the wrong Chipotle. So I told him to give me some time and I would be at the right one! I spent 10 minutes looking for my car charger, when my phone died and I couldn't find it. I didn't want to drive around aimlessly, and I didn't want to be rude and not show up, so I went to the Verizon store and bought a $30 rapid car charger. That took about 15 minutes.

When I get in the car and charge up my phone, I have 3 unread messages, all from him saying things like ""Where are you?"", ""It shouldn't take this long"" and ""Are you almost here?"". I ignore them so I can navigate. Eventually I get to the Chipotle and I just get a drink, because I'm way too nervous to eat anyway. I sit down at a table with him, and he's already finished his food, which is fine because I know I took awhile to get there. I sit down, and promptly apologize for being late, explaining that my phone died and I had to buy a car charger. He just stares at me for a second before saying ""yup."" So I just was like, okay. And then he stared at me for another 5 minutes. 

I decided to say something to break the awkwardness and said ""So, how was your day?"" and he goes ""It was okay. I spent a lot of time waiting."" I was immediately uncomfortable, because I hate being guilt tripped, and I had already apologized. I can't turn back time, so there wasn't really anything else to be done. I just sat there for another few minutes, having absolutely nothing to say after that. So he says ""We can go to the house now."" and gets up. So I follow him out, and follow him to the house in my car. 

When we get to the house, he shows me around, gives me a tour of this really amazing house. It's in a huge wealthy neighborhood, and has a lot of amazing features. After the tour is over though, he sits down at his computer and just started playing Fifa. For almost an hour. 

I watched him play Fifa for almost an hour before I got a call from my roommate, asking me to pick her up. She doesn't have a reliable car and sometimes gets stranded places. We are really close friends and I don't mind picking her up. So I explained to him what was happening, and he says ""You're leaving? You haven't even been here that long."" I was just mind boggled. So I go ""Well, she's stranded..."" and he says ""I'm sure she'll be fine. Doesn't she have someone else to pick her up?"" Like I'm actually going to leave my roommate stranded in below freezing weather?? 

So I said ""No, I really have to pick her up."" Then he walked me to my car, and I got in and started up my phone so I could figure out the navigation, which wasn't working so I was freaking out a little and was in the driveway for about 7 minutes. As I turn around to back out of the driveway, I see him watching me leave, which made me severely uncomfortable.

Overall, I didn't have a good time, and he made me very uncomfortable and was kind of rude. He's been texting me random tid bits like ""Hey"" or ""Haven't heard from you in awhile.""

do,"I'll offload my thoughts and feelings that have currently arisen. There seems to be a lot that I would like to share, however I'm not sure where or who to turn to. 

I'll begin with work and the psychological effects that have been playing out over the past few months. I don't particularly enjoy my job for several reasons. 1. I'm not exactly the happiest person at work (outside of work I'm a totally different person) so it makes work hard. 2. I don't like the clientele 3. I don't like many people that I work with. 3. Work long hours and have to drop everything for the business which ends up leading onto my more personal issues. 

Before I go onto this I'll explain my opinions and thoughts while at work. With The people i work with I sometimes feel jealous of the social skills they behold. The confidence that they have. However the people I admire or feel jealous of for these abilities is that they tend to be stuck up their own arses and tend to be passive aggressive in either direct or indirect conversations with me. This in turn makes me feel inadequate, become less confident. However I'd say I am a confident person, not to the extent that I want to be but I'm sure that'll come with more experience in life. This makes work a little unbearable especially seeming that I work in a bar and restaurant.

The reasons for the other issues at work I feel are down to the poor management and the idiotic approach colleagues seem to have to work, then again it could be me? Anyway I feel demotivated to work, I feel demotivated to achieve the goals and objectives of my personal projects. I sometimes feel that I don't remember things properly and that gets me down. Also I usually pride myself on listening skills but recently I find that my mind is awash with thoughts which take me away from the moment. I've tried meditation, it works only sometimes.

Furthermore I feel physically and mentally tired  everyday. My eating cycle is all over the place due to work and sometimes don't eat as much as i should. Furthermore This tired thing happens even if I've eaten pretty healthily (which is most days) and gotten enough sleep. Oh and one last thing my water retention seems to be terrible but that could be a side effect of anxiety that seems to be apart of my subconscious.

So my seeking advice is on how to improve my social skills and confidence. While also finding the motivation to actually achieve things in my life. 

Despite how depressing the tone of this message may be, I'm actually pretty happy. I have a lot of great friends and family. There's just something that I need to unlock this year and I don't really know how to. I feel that this year is going to be a great year, it's started really well but I'm getting fed up of some of the shit that seems to be prevailing within it at present.

If any extra information is needed then let me know and I shall reply. I will warn that I'm pretty slow at being online due to my long hours at work. Currently I'm on a split shift today. Started work at 9am then my second shift ends at 11pm. So it's a long day..."

do,"By no standard is it necessary that all of these games' multiplayers need to be the same, it's a matter of whether it would further the quality of the games themselves.  

One side debates that it would add options to the games themselves, another argued that it would require too many servers and would be an unnecessary addition to perfectly fine single player games.  
The latter also argued that multiplayer simply wouldn't function properly with many games due to the single player gaming mechanisms clashing with fluidity.

This is a debate that sparked amongst roommates and the arguing had gone on for way too long, hence my curiosity for opinion.

do,Is it possible to see the Orion Nebula with the Naked eye? I was out last night and I looked up at the Orion Constellation and i saw what appeared to be a dim haze in the lower part of the Constellation.
do,"First, a little background:

I come from a family which is absolutely plagued with depression. Both of my parents, my uncle and cousins have suffered and been medicated for depression at some point. I've had my own issues and never knew what was wrong with me until about a year ago when I started getting psychiatric help. To my surprise I was diagnosed with Dysthymia, a mild form of depression. I have over the last few months resolved the most severe aspects of my depression (all without medication) and now am in the position of coping with the terminal feelings of emotional segregation and apathy.

Now, to my experience last night which **changed everything**:

My ring of friends tends to be filled with eccentrics, artists and rookie philosophers since these are the types I most identify with. With this lot inevitably comes a variety of recreational substances being used. I smoke, drink and smoke pot every once in a while, but haven't done anything too out of the ordinary. I have one friend in particular who is a huge advocates of psychedelics. He's always saying I should try eating mushrooms, but the thought of hours of disassociation with reality scares the living hell out of me.

This post isn't about shrooms though. Last night I decided to show my friend [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV7trJiWVhc). To my surprise he said he had some salvia handy and asked if I'd like to try it. Again, I was scared of the disassociation from reality that would result. After a little arm-twisting and the fact that my wife thought it would be funny to see the results of it, I took the plunge. The 15 minutes the salvia had its effect were the happiest, most peaceful I have had in years. After the effects wore off, all last night and still today I'm still feeling a general sense of empathy for others and love for myself I didn't think could be possible.

After researching this morning I found these residual effects last around 72 hours. It also looks like some [studies have shown potential of psychedelics in the treatment of depression and other mental disorders](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=psychedelics-may-help-treat-depression). It is cheaper than prescription medications for depression and is legal to buy and sell federally (not sure about specific states, but I live in Utah so..yeah).
I'm  curious to see if others have had a similar experience.

**TL;DR** Smoked salvia. I've been much happier since."
do,"I've decided to try online dating again and I've downloaded Tinder. I know it's got a reputation as being a hook up app, but I wanted to ask you ladies what your opinions are - do you think there are relationship worthy men on there? Have you had any good experiences? 

I'm vetting men by swiping left on guys who talk about sex in their profiles or whose pictures of them are all out partying or with their shirts off in the hopes that will filter out those who are only looking to hook up. I'm on other dating sites too but I've found there are more men of my looks type on Tinder."

My issue is the hair line on top showing with darker hairs than the baby-fine, blonde ones on my large bald spot.  Any suggestions?

My wife's middle name is the same name as my former best friend. My wife's mother has the same name as my ex-husband's new wife. My wife's father has the same name as my former stepdad. My wife's stepdad has the same name as my former stepdad's father.

Both my mother-in-law and ex's sister have the same middle name, which is the same as my former aunt's first name.

My mother has the same name as her ex-husband's sister. My ex-husband has the same middle name as my former stepdad's mother. The former stepdad remarried a woman with the same first name as my mother's new mother-in-law.

My best friend and I have the same middle name (we met at 11). My wife has the same first name as a family friend I've known since I was 5 (same spelling of the name).

My grandpa and my wife's uncle have the same name. And there are also at least 3 women called Ida in each of our families. 

My dog (that I got when she was already named) has the same name as my grandma's middle name.

I'm 22 currently and have recently been freaking out about the future. I think reality has just hit me and I'm realizing everything. I got my first job and car a few months ago so that really made things real and it's so weird. I guess you could call it an existential crisis.


Either way I've been thinking about this and I'm scared of it. Scared of what will happen in the future. Currently my life is terrible. Dead end job, still in my parents house because I can't afford my own place because of my dead end job, only one real friend. No money for college, you name it.


I honestly do believe I'm trans, I've thought about it so many times and talked about it multiple times with my friend. Ever since I was young I've wanted to be a girl I even once told my sister when we were younger. I just can't admit it.

Move from a partial hospitalization program, to seeing a therapist three times a week, and a psychiatrist every six weeks. Six months later and I'm still seeing my therapist three times a week. I feel like I've made a lot of progress though. 

Three weeks since my last suicidal thought. Four weeks since I've had an intrusive flash back to the night I found my dad. I need to work on the eating thing. There are days I just don't give a shit enough to eat. More because it's too much effort than it is a desire for self harm. I think? Either way I have bipolar II and the last few days I've felt alright. Not great, but not terrible. So maybe I've finally started to stabilize. Bit early to tell. Need to figure out if I'm just in a hypomanic bout or not. 

My problem is this: My siblings are pressuring me to try and find a job. A thing I'm uncomfortable with, but not something I consider to be an unreasonable request. I know I'll eventually have to take the jump. But when do you make that leap? What does that feel like? If I'm still chewing the shit out of my cheek till the inside get's swollen and sore is that too much anxiety?  How depressed is too depressed?  

My second question is: Is it unreasonable to let my siblings talk with my therapist? (Neither for family therapy, nor to provide my therapist with insight about how the perceive my illness) I've said no and I'm standing by that boundary. I'm just curious what others say."
do,"I was good friends with a girl when I was about 12-13 (I'm 18 now). I think she liked me, but I'm not totally sure. She moved out of town, and only came back last August. We haven't been hanging out much since then because of how terribly busy we have both been. I still like her, so I asked her if she wanted to go to dinner on Friday. My initial intent was for it to be a date, but I wussed out and used vague wording. Now I'm going into Friday unsure of whether or not I'm on a date. I really don't want to screw this up by asking if she thinks this is a date because the way u see it, it ends poorly for me either way. Either she thought it was a date and is concerned that I didn't or she didn't think it was a date and is freaked out that I might have. What should I do?"

do,"I'm a freshman at a top computer science school. Last semester things were great. My grades were good, I had a lot of friends, and I felt happy. I felt like I belonged at my school.

Everything changed when I came back to school. The day after I came back, I asked out my best friend, whose long time boyfriend broke up with her a month prior. She told me no, but the next day said that she had a thing for me after her boyfriend broke up with her but because I didn't make a move during winter break she assumed I never liked her as more than friends and moved on.

I think the whole situation with my best friend really caused me to drown. I became depressed and a lot more angry. A lot of my friends began to distance themselves from me. Even though some of them still call me ""bestie"" when they see me for the first time in weeks, I know it's not true because they never reached out to me. My best friend and I barely hang out anymore, and I feel like we're on completely different pages and misunderstanding each other too. What's even worse is that I've begun to realize I still have feelings for her, even though she's moved on to other guys. I know for a fact one of the guys who might end up being her boyfriend is really going to hurt her in the long run. And I don't know why I care or why I even should care, but I do. I still want her, and it makes me so fucking sick that I feel this way. 

It's also taken a toll in my classes. I thought my classes would be easy this semester, but they're really hard. I think part of it was being depressed and super stressed with the social situations around me and losing my best friend that gave me a really rocky start to the semester. I haven't recovered. My grades are worse than they were. I dropped two of my classes (one non-required one credit class, the other one being a required course for my major). I just learned the online course I replaced it with today won't even count for a general requirement, which was not the impression my roommate gave me and one of our friends when we signed up for it. I can't replace it with anything else. In addition, I got in some trouble in one of my computer science courses when I collaborated with a friend on one of my assignments, which is not allowed in course policy, and I'm going to lose a letter grade in the course. 

I also have minor ADHD (I was diagnosed during my freshman year of high school), and I feel that it is affecting me now more than ever in school as well. I feel like I can't do simple assignments when I know I should be able to. Lately I also feel like I'm a lot more upset and angry. All I want to do is just sleep and not wake up for a long time.

I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like everything is crashing around me. I feel like I have to fake being happy. I'm just done."
do,"So I moved to a new apartment 3 weeks ago and got Time Warner Cable internet. I'm paying for the ""extreme"" internet, which is 50mbps download &amp; 5mbps upload. My internet speeds are fine when I use speedtest.net (see [here](http://i.imgur.com/EvL5Kil.png)), and I can use streams such as Twitch.tv on the highest quality with little to no buffering.

For example, the yahoo.com homepage has about 600KB of data according to http://smallseotools.com/website-page-size-checker/. At 50mbps it should take less than 0.1 seconds to load. But when I try to load the page it takes 5-10 seconds to fully load. The same issue occurs for all other webpages.

and

I was still having the issue so I contacted them again, the second rep had me reset my router and modem as well as clear Chrome's cookies and site data, still no change. After that he said 
&gt;""There is no issue with TWC. I am monitoring the signals remotely from my side and they are pretty good. I also ran a ping test remotely from my side and I see that your modem is receiving perfect signals now without any signal loss.

After that he said that he couldn't do anything else, and I would have to pay if I wanted a technician to come out.

I can play the part easily during the day. People have a tendency to see what they want to see. You can lead them to draw their own conclusions. Outwardly I'm friendly and sweet. I take my studies seriously and always have perfect attendance. I keep up relationships and make important connections.

When I'm alone it hurts to think how no one sees. I thought those closest to me might but I've been hiding this so long I shouldn't be surprised. Sometimes I let my boyfriend catch a glimpse of what a mess I really am before pulling it all back together with a joke and sweet smile.  

At night I don't sleep anymore. I lay awake and let tears fall if they come. I think about tearing apart my life and letting how I feel inside show in my life because it would be so easy. Night feels like a safe time because I'm alone with my thoughts and plans. I can keep hiding everything as long as it comes out at the end of each day.

And I have nothing to show for it, besides champions, skins, and my rank, which is meaningless for my future goals. My grades suffered all throughout college for it. Now let's see if I can wait until the 16th...

I plan on returning to video games one day, but that's only when I have my life together, and I've gotten to where I want to be in life, or I'm retired.

Once my account gets deleted, my connection to gaming will be gone. I got rid of my ps4, all my games, got rid of my gaming keyboard and mouse, deleted all games off my iPhone.

Here's to a new semester in college, one where I won't be hindered by gaming, and one that will hopefully be like my freshman year in 2012 (where I socialized, went out, and stepped out of my comfort zone more times than I did my whole life, until I transferred schools)."

do,"Hey r/virgin, I just want to rant for a bit and get some things off my chest. 

I'm 23 now, had a few girlfriends in high school but never went all the way. So going back then I was a pretty nerdy guy, not socially inept but not exactly the most charismatic kid. I made friends but never any lasting friendships, and like I said had a couple girlfriends(longest relationship being just over a year) but never went all the way. 

College was fun, made some friends that were as nerdy as I am, mostly all in an engineering major like me. For the first two years I was just focusing on having fun, parties and drinking and late night dnd games. The problem was these social gatherings were all full of guys, nerdy engineering guys, even the engineering frats' party were 90% male. That's who I surrounded myself with, I maybe had contact with 5-6 girls for those two years, but it was fun and I figured relationships would come later. 

After the first two years though my funds started to run dry, I lost a scholarship and started to realize how expensive my fun out of state engineering school was. So I transferred, I made the decision and don't regret it, I enrolled in a smaller school in my home state, not the best but still a respected program for my major. I got my first 'real' job too. Washing dishes for minimum wage. Hated it but gave it my all, made friends with the kitchen staff, and a month and a half later one of the cooks got arrested(they were all cons going in and out of jail) and the other cooks asked the boss if I could move to the kitchen instead of finding someone new. He agreed, I got a nice pay bump, and spent the next 8 months in that kitchen. All was good except that became my social life. I was a full time student(23hrs) working 40 hours a week in a sketchy kitchen. All my off time was spent there or studying. I made friends in school but rarely saw them outside class. One liked me enough though, he was in my major and had a job with a small company in our industry, wasn't the best paying but it was real world experience. When he graduated he put up for his old position and I got it, quit the resteraunt and started there. I worked less hours and tried to get my social life back on track but by this point I was entering my final year and a half and classes were getting more intense, so my social life never progressed more than a few drinks after classes. 

This continued until graduation and because of my experience in the field and high GPA I had a good job secured months before I graduated with a massive corperation, that was paying just above average starting for my field. Moved across the state, away from all my friends, and started there. With it being my first out of college job I wanted to get a good start on my career and really busted my ass. 11 hour days(for no ot) and being the first person everyone comes to when they need help with their work. I made friends there two but we rarely went out and I let my social life die completly. 

This was six months ago. Now I'm leaving that job for another in late August.(with a 68.75% pay bump whoot!) And moving back to the city I went to high school in for this new job. I will reconnect with my old hs friends when I finally move and plan to try and get my social life back up to par. I would also like to start dating again and finally get my v-card punched. I have no problem being social but I've never been able to flirt or really be romantic with women. I have also been seeing a dominatrix for the past 6 months(once or twice a month) to satisfy my fetishy needs and while this does take care of me sexualy I still want to be with someone and actually have sex.

So that's where I'm at in life, thank you for reading. I feel like  doing good in my career but at the cost of my social life and the loneliness is really starting to set in. I'm 5'11 250lbs(I wear it well) and pretty good socially but ro real romantic experience and too sure what to do about it. Sometimes I feel like I wasted my opportunity to get into the dating game. I just needed to say all that, I don't get too talk about personal things too often and it helps."

do,"I'm currently a senior software engineer (self taught) and have been enjoying this work for the last 10 years. I feel like I should be further along in my career than I am, but I also find that any motivation to further my career to be severely lacking. The last time I felt like this, I changed employers and that seemed to help a little bit, but now I think it's more than just a change of scenery.

I've enjoyed the work, but in classic INTP fashion, I feel like I'm quite proficient but don't have the motivation to focus and become an expert in a single area. I had a discussion with a few other software engineers a couple years ago and a question came up: ""What motivates you in software development?"" My answer: ""I like learning new things"". I understand enough and now the work feels boring or like busy-work.

I'm thinking of a complete career change, but 1) it completely scares me, and 2) I have no idea what to do next. I'm happiest when I'm learning something new. Once I understand it, I move on and look for the next thing I can learn. My latest interests (based on the books I just bought and websites I tend to read) are philosophy, astronomy, math and logic problems, volunteering with local animal shelter, and learning more about depression. I've been dealing with depression for the last several years and have found a way to successfully manage it (there are always bad days of course) with lots of hard work.

To give an example of my interests, I was just at Powell's bookstore in Portland, OR (it is an amazing bookstore, highly recommend visiting). I bought *The Zen Path through Depression* by Philip Martin, *Death by Black Hole* by Neil deGrasse Tyson, *Quiet* by Susan Cain, *Chaos* by James Gleick, and *Things To Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension* by Matt Parker.

TL;DR I'm thinking of making a career change from software engineer to something else, but I don't know what to pick? I guess I'm looking for ideas for a possible career change. Anyone else ever made this leap, and what career did you change to?

I have Schizotypal personality disorder. Which sucks, and for the longest time not something I could, or wanted, to talk about. But I decided to open up recently and start talking about my problems, and my walk through them. I figured the best way to really do that would be through a blog.

The blog can be found at:

it's still a work in progress, but all the important stuff is there. I post every Monday and Friday. The Monday posts I try to keep on lighter subjects, and focus more on the heavy things on Friday.

You can also follow me on twitter, www.twitter.com/austifox (@austifox) I don't post a ton, mainly just when I update my blog, and a few things here and there. Most of my posts on twitter revolve around gaming or tech."
do,"Just been one of those nights in bed on the internet looking up symptoms of mental illnesses and trying to diagnose myself in hopes of finding better coping methods. And here I come to find that fear of talking on the phone is not just me! I'm not crazy, and there's a whole Reddit thread that feels the same way! My mind is being blown right now.

I don't even know what it is specifically about phone calls. Just the awkwardness, I suppose. The pauses, the lack of body language and facial expression, the stuttering, the repeating of words until the other person can hear you. It makes me so terribly uncomfortable. I dread ever having to make a phone call. I'm okay with talking on the phone with about 2 people in this world- my mother and my boyfriend. And getting to that point with my boyfriend took a little while for me. 

When I had a job for about a year (recently quit because of moving to college), my boss would sometimes call the store and ask what was happening, what I was doing, if it was busy. She was absolutely insane and very very disorganized. Talking to her made me anxious. Especially on the phone because she would talk so softly and her having an accent didn't help!!! I absolutely dreaded seeing my phone ring when I was at work and it being a coworker or my boss. Most of the time I couldn't bring myself to pick up and I'd let it go to voicemail and text them back later. It's so unprofessional of me and immature too. An almost 19 year old woman afraid of phone conversations? Pathetic. But I can't help it. It terrifies me."
do,"Hi reddit.  This is my first time posting here, as I was recommended to this sub after posting on /r/relationships.  This is going to be a long one (I'm so sorry), but I had to talk to someone about this, and I thought it was the best way to figure out any options I may have.  I'm at my wit's end.  Throwaway because it's pretty serious and while I don't know anyone who reddits, I can't be too careful.

Background:  I've always been pretty purposed - by this I mean, I strive to be successful.  It's not that I'm particularly motivated to do anything for myself, but I feel as though success itself means I must be doing well.  The problem with that is even through all of that, I still felt sad at the end of the day, sometimes having incredibly dark thoughts.

I have always had pretty severe clinical depression.  I was diagnosed when I was 17 and it started to make sense why I was sad all the time.  However, when I was diagnosed, I was also trying to get into a job field where I could NOT be on any antidepressants or any other prescriptions for mental illness whatsoever.  Long story short, I refused to get the prescription and never disclosed to anyone how bad my depression really is.

My freshman year of college, I was particularly sad.  Changing routines seems to mess with my mood, as I've noticed.  I quickly moved in with a girlfriend who ended up being emotionally and sexually abusive towards me.  It really did some damage to my self esteem and I felt stuck.  I felt as though I still loved her dearly and wanted to make things work no matter what.  She ended up cheating on me, several times.  Eventually I put an end to it, but we continued to live together due to our lease ending soon after the break up.  Closer to the lease ending, she started becoming apologetic towards me and told me she wanted to make things work.  More manipulation, and I fell for it.  Four days before the lease ended, my parents showed up to my doorstep saying that my gf called saying I'm suicidal and need to be taken to the hospital immediately.  Them knowing my mental health history, they did just that.  My ex, being the manipulator she was, convinced me it wasn't her so that I wouldn't disclose that she was also gay (her family is extremely Catholic).

After finding out more about me, that I am gay, my parents immediately cut me off.  They stopped giving me money for living expenses (I was on scholarship for academics) and since I was in student apartments, I had no where to go.  I ended up being homeless/sleeping on friends' couches for the majority of the summer.

I finally managed to find a decent paying job, but no benefits, and also landed a couple more scholarships/loans to cover books and day-to-day expenses, like food.  I was able to stay enrolled.

Long story short, I managed to finish college, get my degree, and I'm fairly successful in my job field.  I have a wonderful, patient girlfriend (long distance) and my friends &amp; family, minus my parents, have been incredibly supportive.

The only thing that has never changed was my depression.  These past holidays only made it worse, but I digress.

Now I moved many states away alone (2 years alone!) and have a fantastic job.  I am completely independent.  I also managed to (partly) mend the relationship with my parents and they are now completely supportive of the fact I am gay.  They decided to move closer to me as well.  My father, however, is a very ignorant person (for lack of a better term) and he commonly is very rude and blunt.  He also gets extremely angry. He told me that he realizes it's an issue, but wants to work on it.  I wanted to give him a chance.  Everything with them was on a good track until recently.  Both parents started making me feel equally guilty for not spending time with them and very unwelcome when I do see them.

On New Years, I spent the evening with my father and uncle.  My uncle is rather young, 18, due to my grandmother adopting a child at an older age.  He spends most of his time with us (story for another time).  Anyways, we decided we wanted to go out for dinner and drinks in the closest metro city (about three hours away).  I have the most reliable vehicle, so we drove my car with the premise that my uncle would drive home.  No problem - I wasn't planning on having much to drink but I never risk drinking and driving.  As the night continued, I was having a lovely time, and I drank a little more than I previously planned.  I also noticed that my father was incredibly intoxicated quickly and started asking rude, invasive questions but I would ignore it (not a huge issue, it's New Years so I tried acting like it didn't bug me too much).  Suddenly I received a call that someone broke into my apartment, but was caught and didn't take anything minus my Playstation 4.  I was on my phone for a good 45 minutes tops, and halfway through I let my father &amp; uncle know what was going on.  I stepped back out to finish the call and give my insurance company a heads up.  On returning to the bar, my father and uncle were gone.  I searched everywhere for them, and my phone was on 5% at that point after calling them both several times (unsuccessfully).  Nowhere to be found.

I finally decided I should try to track down my vehicle to see if maybe they were there.  The walk to my vehicle was about 20 minutes (and being somewhat drunk didn't help).  Again, nowhere to be found.  I finally received a drunken call from my father saying they're on their way home already, and they're not coming back.  He hung up and then soon after my phone died.  Here I am stuck in a city alone and I have no way of calling anyone.  At this point I'm annoyed and tired and my apartment was broken into.  It was well past midnight and I had no idea where the time went.  So I tried walking to a few hotels near me and they were all booked.  Finally, I found one and stayed the night.  I used the hotel phone to call myself a cab to take me home the next day (not cheap).

When I was back home, I found my car parked at my apartment with my keys in it.  I was pissed - so I called my uncle and asked what the hell happened.  He told me my father was irate and angry, so they just up and left (my uncle doesn't have much of a spine, he is supported mostly by my parents; also sort of close minded like my father).  My mother was on vacation, so she had no clue what had happened.  I blame my father 100% for what happened.  I never received an apology.  I told my mother the whole story when she returned from vacation, but supposedly my father had lied to her about the situation and she took his side.

I spent a little over a week trying to calm down about it all.  Eventually I decided that I needed to set limitations on my interaction with them.  I let them know that the situation and a culmination of rude and toxic comments/actions from my father caused me to want to restrict seeing them.  I sent them this in a text.  My father quickly replied and tried calling, saying I am overreacting and that I'm being a child about it all.

I never replied to him, and heard nothing from my mother for awhile.  My cousin, who I have not seen in quite some time, is visiting my parents.  I was best friends with my cousin growing up, and he really wants to see me.  Unfortunately, he doesn't have a car here and he has no clue about the situation with my parents minus the fact that I told him I'm not really on speaking terms with them at the moment.  We've talked, and he's planning on staying over a couple days during his visit.

Here's where the problem lies: my depression is getting incredibly worse.  It's starting to degrade some of the relationships with friends because I'm so sad I don't even want to leave home sometimes.  I also feel like it's causing me to act rudely or disrespectfully towards my girlfriend (she's been so patient with me, it's unbelievable).  I love her and my friends/family to death, but even that isn't keeping me happy.  I feel as though my presence in people's lives causes more issues than good.  My cousin has to tiptoe around my parents because of me, not to mention my parents basically act as though I'm a parasite.  My friends all usually have to travel long distance to see me (even when I get a break from work) so I feel like I take advantage of their friendships.  I know these feelings are probably just through my perspective, but they're all part of me feeling worthless and hopeless.  Even moving up in my job field doesn't interest me anymore.

I'm trying to focus on things that I enjoy, but I can't seem to get enjoyment out of any of it.  I can't eat much anymore, and I get anxiety attacks from simply going to the grocery or gas station.  The only things I look forward to are small plans I make here and there, but then they turn out to disappoint me anyways.

I'm to the point now where I don't even see a point of continuing on like I am.  If I were to be put on antidepressants, I would lose my job and dig an even bigger hole.  I can't talk to my parents, and my closest friends are too far away to do anything anyways.  My girlfriend is planning on changing jobs, so she's stressed out as it is.  I would hate for her to worry about me like that.  I'm stuck mentally and I have no clue where to go from here.  I have more and more frequent dark thoughts.  I'm not even sure seeing a mental health professional would do me much good - if I am hospitalized for those reasons, I lose my job.  This is strange to say, but I don't even feel suicidal in the common sense.  I don't want to put in the work and emotional fortitude for that.  I would rather just slip away in my sleep.  I know it won't come down to that or suicide, but I thought it was important to mention.

What do I do?  I feel emotionally exhausted.  I just want to be happy because of myself, regardless of the relationships I have in my life.  I want the depression to stop.  I don't even know what advice someone could have to help me."
do,"So, I was diagnosed over summer with mild autism spectrum (under new DSM V, told its what would be diagnosed as aspergers in the past), and I'm wondering if this particular pattern of mine shows up at all with people, as it's something that basically everyone has thought I'm crazy for.

I've never gotten anything out of dealing with pets, and to an extent, I've just accepted it as a thing people do. A similar thing applies for infants/children anywhere below the point that I can't talk to them. I've known plenty of people with the issue with children, but like no one that gets my not getting anything out of dealing with pets. I also know that pets are frequently mentioned as a thing that those with Aspergers like, but I'm wondering if there's anyone else that just.... doesn't get that, or what about that interaction is supposed to be enjoyable."

do,"I need some advice

Me and my girlfriend have been together for two years. I live in the USA she lives in Colombia. We talk every single day and have had about 9 months together irl over those two years.

Recently we have been having some friction. I love her very much and I feel she is one of the few people out there who really understands me. But she is from a completely different culture than me. And her personality is completely different.

I'm a american-colombian who grew up in both Colombia and America, and while I have things I like about Colombian culture there are things I much, much, prefer from American culture. My girlfriend is flat out 100% Colombian.

Colombians are very laid back, and not punctual. Something I hate (being a sperglord) and it drives me crazy to no end. When someone tells me they are going to be somewhere at a certain time and get there 15- 30 minutes to sometimes hours later it irks me to no end. While that is naturally part of their culture. Similarly I hate this whole siesta thing, taking a nap right after lunch seems completely stupid to me, and goes against my work ethic. A lot of these things I would want to say are flat out laziness, but I know they are cultural differences that have developed due to different climates/beliefs/and religions.

To get to the core of the issue lately she says I criticize her too much and won't leave her alone, that she's sick and bored of me correcting her when doing certain things that I don't think she does correctly. And at the same time I really have to work hard to not blurt out and talk when I see her doing something improperly, or inefficiently.

We are wildly in love and I want to marry this girl. I took me over a year to convince her to officially become my girlfriend (Rituals concerning relationships in Colombia remain stuck in Elizabethan era, and I had to ask her parents permission and sign my name in blood etc). But I'm worried that I'm turning her off by my own actions and I can't seem to change them.

I am somewhat self limited by the short temper I have from being a utter perfectionist, something that she can't seem to comprehend, and despite understanding my bouts of anger, she despises them and uses them as a reason she believes a marriage would fail between us.

There's also some sexual hangups but I'm not going to expand on those unless someone feels they are absolutely necessary.

tl;dr: My girlfriend and I are facing issues reconciling our cultural differences."

do,"Okay so I have a 2 year old shih tzu jack russell terrier cross, who we've had since she was about 2 and half months old. She's 3 at the end of the month.

I'm not sure if this behaviour is because I've been at university for the last three months and she's just expressing that she's happy I'm back or because she's in season. But she has never acted like this before.

She tried to hump my arm every now and again, however this time it's almost obsessive humping. She scratches at my arm (which is now entirely red...), whines, growls and barks at me when I tell her no. I kick her out of my room and she scratches at the door. She does this with my brother too, but not nearly as much. Before it was just ""no"" and she'd stop. This time she won't stop.

She is not spayed and my mum is 200% sure that she will never get her fixed, even if I suggest it I will get a response like ""yeah? and who's going to pay for that? Not me, I'll tell you that much"". She doesn't want to breed her, she just doesn't see that point because we have to keep her on a leash. I would offer to pay for it myself, but I'm unemployed and can barely afford to live.

We take her the same walk route every day and I've never seen dogs at it, so I don't understand where she could have learnt this behaviour.

What can I do? Sorry this is so long, I'm trying to answer as many possible questions as I can ;-;"
do,"So, I'm going to start off by saying I've known her for a few months now, since September. We're currently studying abroad in Dublin, but we fly home Saturday.

But, I started developing a huge crush on her. And I like to bake, so I invited her to help with making a few cakes, and she did join me. We weren't alone for it, as it was in our program sponsored building, and they had staff there and other students came in, etc. We talked, then caught the bus back and sat together and talked more (after the last one - she had to leave earlier than I did for the first one). I just don't know where I stand with her, as I didn't really view them as dates, but don't know how she feels.

It also doesn't help that she was pretty bad off from alcohol Saturday and I was really drunk and just doing anything possible to help her, even to the point of staring down others so I could do something for her. 

It also restarted my depression issues, because I just hate not knowing where I stand.

Anyway, we're flying home Saturday, and we're going to the same airport, where I have a layover and she lives. I just don't know if I should make a move before then (or make a move at all!), or just try to get her American phone number and talk to her over break or whatever.

I'm just so confused.

Every day that I have to go back to the daily grind after a short break I get incredibly depressed, anxious, lose any motivation I have to do pretty much anything aside from fuse with my couch, and I lash out at anything and everything that looks at me wrong. Every fiber of my being screams at me to keep the weekend going, so I end up staying up way too late, doing some mindless activity like watching hours of youtube, or sometimes staring at nothing and dreading the week to come. I obsess over the fact that the current global economy requires me to go into debt in order to  work to pay off my debt, rather than utilizing the barter system (rationally, I know this is stupid and not an entirely accurate description of the global economy, but after about 3-4 PM on Sundays rational thought starts to fade away as my sense of dread begins to take over).


In middle school, this would manifest itself in panic attacks that would happen on Sunday nights, but also Monday mornings, where my dad would literally have to drag me kicking and screaming to school because that was like the worst torture chamber imaginable at the time. My mother felt bad once I was diagnosed in 6th Grade with ADHD and General Anxiety Disorder including Social Anxiety, and would let me stay home, often for a week or two. She was trying to help, but honestly made things much worse for me down the road.


I've got a wife and a toddler now, and they're the only thing keeping me going when I feel this way. If I were single I would probably just stop showing up for work like I used to do with school and the first couple of minimum wage jobs I had. But I can't, and that contributes to a feeling of being trapped, which is ridiculous as well because I love my life and my family and what I've accomplished.


The craziest thing about this whole thing is that I *only* feel like this on Sunday nights. Sure, I've got a case of the Mondays the next morning, but I don't have the urge to just stay home all day like I do the night before. Once I'm at work everything is back to normal (though I still struggle with staying focused on work as I'm not able to get medication right now). I even tell myself I'm ridiculous and I'm not going to act that way again. Then, like a switch, once I realize it's close to 4 PM on Sunday and that the weekend is slipping away from me, I'm right back to where I was a week before. It's maddening. 


I posted this here (on an alt account) because even though it might be more than ADHD, I believe ADHD is the center of the issue. The fact that it's only related to something boring and mundane that I am forced into such as work rather than every aspect of my life makes me believe that it isn't straight up depression, and the fact that I still have the sense of dread that I felt underneath the panic makes me think it's more than just anxiety (which I've gotten under control for the most part. I have maybe 1 or 2 panic attacks at the most every year or so.) It's as if my ADHD symptoms become this hyper-concentrated form of Super ADHD every Sunday, like an ADHD Werewolf.


I've gotten to the point where I don't really do anything fun anymore so that time doesn't pass as quickly and it feels like there's more time in between Sunday nights. That's probably compounding the problem, though,  because that has made the week even more mundane, which is part of the reason I get so out of sorts on Sundays.


&amp;nbsp;

I just really need to know that I'm not the only person with ADHD who has gone through something like this and if any of you know how to deal with it.


&amp;nbsp;


**TL;DR** - Incapacitating sense of dread on Sunday nights because work starts back up on Monday. Turns me into an ADHD Werewolf who is completely miserable to be around. Everything is fine the next day. I feel like I'm the only one like this and I need to know if anyone has some anti-ADHD silver bullets I can throw at this thing.

do,"*Sorry for the length, i just started pouring my heart out...first, for background, here is my throwaway post, I suppose no longer anonymous. It's a long one, but hopefully it will help you to understand how low I've felt, understand the place I'm coming from. I was diagnosed as bipolar with depression and severe anxiety several years ago, and after years of feeling like I was fighting essentially alone, have finally come out of my fog of illness...only to 'wake up' to this.*
http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1k160n/you_said_with_a_sad_look_on_your_face_that_you/



It's amazing what a difference one week of deep introspection can make. Yesterday, I saw this quote...""Obstacles are put in your way to see if what you want is really worth fighting for."" 


And I was looking at a photo of us, smiling together...both the quote and the picture are meaningful to me, and yes, they're related. This year, I have learned that pain and stress can be so overwhelming that you feel like you've just got nothing left to give...it IS possible to forgive after being emotionally destroyed...and betrayal can come in many ways, shapes and forms--but so can hope and love. 

They say that ""The Powers That Be"" will not give you more than you can handle...but when you're pushed up to the end of that ledge, that precipice where you feel like you really CAN'T take any more, you need to just be able to let go, and be confident that someone (be it friends, family, a higher power, or hell, even yourself) will catch you when you plummet into the darkness. Into the abyss, the terrifying 'unknown'. 


There have been some intense hurricanes in our lives this past year. The 'house' we built was on a strong foundation, but it was damaged terribly, over and over again. We would try to rebuild, but  the storms kept coming. Finally, the mother of them all hit, and the house was virtually destroyed...Leaving nothing but the rafters, wistful memories, and the foundation...absolutely NOTHING else left but twisted wreckage of our past, our love. Pictures, soaked not in rainwater, but my tears. Relentlessly, the storm pounded, again and again.  Every time I started to get on my feet to try to shore up a wall, I was knocked over by another gust. I felt so alone, trying to fight, seeing memories of us swirling around me. Tossed around mercilessly like a rag doll, I felt that you were gone, and I fought alone.


Suddenly, it all went quiet. I was in a moment of uneasy peace, in the very eye of the storm. I looked up and saw you, as battered and bruised as I was...despite the losing battle to save our house, you hadn't abandoned me for good, as I thought you had. You had disappeared into the storm when the last ""Big One"" hit, and I thought you were gone forever, leaving me to fight this last battle alone...but just as my strength was giving out, just as I fell to my knees, you reappeared. You came back for me, right at the point when I was about to give up, when I had absolutely no fight left in me. At that moment, I had a realization, an epiphany...I was, and we are, stronger than the forces swirling around us. 


You reached through the mess, the debris and remnants of our life together, and took my hand. In my minds eye, I saw clear as day, the day we first built the house...the happiness, the pure intentions, and the hope for our long future together...and realized that the storms will eventually pass, you will look at that strong foundation that you initially built your home, your dreams on, the foundation that you found yourself clinging to during the height of the storm...the only thing that kept you from being completely blown away...and you will remember how beautiful it used to be, how happy you once were in it. And somehow, you will find the strength inside, the power that you never realized you had, and you will decide to try again. The strength to not give up, or give in. The strength to rebuild one more time, and move on past the memories of the pain the storms caused, past the emotional wreckage...because in your mind you've come to finally, truly realize how precious what's left is, and how valuable that foundation that wasn't pulverized really is. 


So in your mind, really that's the only choice that makes sense...you come back together, regroup and move on. Rebuilding takes work on both sides, if the parties involved are on the same page, and are following the same blueprints of rebuilding the love, the trust, and both have a commitment to persevere...with a healthy dose of dedication, it will all work itself out in the end.  The work, the reconstruction has begun...the house will be stronger, more beautiful than it ever was, and will be able to withstand all that the nature of the world has to throw at it. Clearing the wreckage will take time, but with some hard work, it can be done.


Sunday is our 11 year wedding anniversary. And guess what...despite ALL of the struggles, the pain, the heartache...I still love you. And I'm not giving up. I choose to rebuild. I will never lose myself again and will fight for myself, and what is mine.

I'm not posting this for pity, replies or upvotes. I posted it so others might see that even in the middle of life's worst storms, you can find a sliver of hope. And for me, a sliver is enough.

do,"I decided I needed something to do and I really enjoy and know a lot about otters, so I volunteered my local zoo. I went through four weeks of general volunteer training and then I had a couple classes on preparing an animal talk. I chose the sea otter for my first talk and it was an amazing experience! People listened to me, talking about one of my favorite animals, and they paid attention! I even got asked questions and I knew the answers. I was so proud of myself and it felt fantastic sharing what I know. So, whenever I want, I show up at the zoo and I log my hours and I go stand in front of otters and talk my little heart out.

do,"Hey everyone. I need a place to vent and place my feelings because I don't know what to do anymore.


This evening while playing a boardgame with my BF and some friends, I found out my BF lied big time.


Short: last year we decided that I would join him this year on his skiing trip with his friends (his idea). This wasn't possible in the end (or so he told me) because his friends didn't want to rent a cabin but go on a cheap student skiing trip. Which was fine for me. But tonight he told his friend that they rented a cabin. I was baffled. When I asked (very friendly) wait babe,... you told me completely different he just disregarded me.
When our friends left I told him (once again very friendly because he is really sensitive if I even show that I'm irritated with something in general) I felt hurt about his lie and I now feel that I can trust him. He responded that I made a fool out of him by acting like I did in front of his friends. I was just taking aback and asked a simple question. But apparently I shamed him. The fact that I feel very ashamed because I'm always the GF that knows nothing and has to hear everything from other sources than my boyfriend is an overreaction in his view.


Now he is acting like nothing is wrong. And I really don't know what to do. This isn't nearly the first time he lied and there have also been other things (like him being unemployed for 6 months and not looking for a job while his parents pay foe everything and he lives with me). But I get that life can be hard and it sometimes can get you down. But I just feel like my trust is broken over and over and over again. And I don't know what to do. Am I overreacting? I really don't know what to do/feel.


TL;DR: BF lied to me (again!). When I found out I told him that I feel hurt and I can't really trust him anymore. He acts as if he did nothing wrong and thus also behaves as if nothing is wrong. I'm really confused now if I am overreacting or not."

do,"I was diagnosed with OCD and depression when I was 16. Ever since I've had countless obsessions. Many things have led me to believe I am a psychopath. At the moment I can't feel anything for anyone. My uncle died last week and I don't feel anything. I've cried a few times but it doesn't come as a release, it's forced. I see everyone around me upset and I just cannot connect. I even think I laugh in my head, and I can't concentrate when people talk to me.

Does this sound like OCD, depression of a traits of a personality disorder?"
do,"I started seeking treatment for depression about a year and a half ago.  I felt I'd always suffered from depression, but it took hitting rock bottom to seek help.  

I've never been normal, and have always felt very different from other people from a social perspective.  I've often wondered if I was perhaps mildly autistic.  Largely because of the persistant feeling that there are things going on socially that I am simply unable to pick up on.  I've had two long term romantic relationships that didn't fare well.  Other than that, I've never had a close friend, and have never actively socialized with anyone.  In four years of university, I didn't meet anyone or have a single social conversation with anyone in my classes.  I lived for a while with my brother and then rented a room by myself.  In highschool I was nicknamed ""anti-social"" because I didn't hang out with anyone.  Although there are times when I become aware of a soul crushing lonliness and desire someone to talk to, I generally don't want to be around anyone.  The obstacles I feel towards making a friend always outweigh the potential benefits I see.

After four or five months of talk therapy for depression, my therapist told me she felt my treatment wasn't working because my psychicatrist didn't get a full or accurate diagnosis.  (I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Dsythmia.)  She took out her diagnostic manual and - (I don't remember her exact words) started reading the characteristics of a Schizoid Personality Constellation.  It felt like she was describing my life.  The next session was our last as she was leaving my area.  So I didn't get much of a chance to discuss what this meant going forward.

So now I'm here.  I've read the wiki link on Schizoid Personality Disorder and watched a powerpoint lecture that someone in this subreddit posted from YouTube.  Although there are some features that apply much more strongly than others, for the most part, the information I've come across feels like it's describing me personally.  I'd be very interested in hearing other people's stories as well as any information or sources that could be shared.  My biggest question right now is:  what next?  What does this diagnosis mean for me going forward?"
do,"Question is in the last paragraph if yah wanna skip the story.

I was prescribed hydrocodone for extreme pain I'd been having for months. After taking one pill I noticed that it had no affect on the pain; however, it did have a huge reaction on my mood and energy. 

I took it at night, as the doctor recommended , to help me sleep through the pain. It ended up boosting my energy, clearing my brain fog, and improving my focus without any negative side effects. I ended up blowing through my homework and cleaning my entire apartment, and slept like a baby the next night. 

I talked to my therapist and psychiatrist about this affect. They said that they had never heard of it before. I was on it when I visited both of them and they both said that they noticed my improved mood, ability to keep track of conversation, less dozing off, and less shaking. I asked my psychiatrist if it would be safe to take half a pill around every 3 days (that's how long the affects last) to help improve my mood. I was originally perceived to take it every 4-6 hours, so my psychiatrist said it'd be fine but to have my bf and others around me monitor it. 

I've been on at least one medication from every class of psychiatric drugs, plus some that had duel purposes (like blood pressure meds that help with ADHD) and none of them worked except for one (Lamictal) that I've been taking for a year. I have been diagnosed with both major depressive disorder and BPD, and a few others, which is why none of the meds ever worked like they should. The hydrocodone has been the ""miracle cure"" but none of my doctors seem to know why. 

Has anyone else with BPD experienced this kind of reaction to hydrocodone?"
do,"Hello,
I have been single for 2 years since I had my first boyfriend, we only lasted three months and it ended up terribly. Six months later I had a hookup and I lost my virginity with him... and I havent got any dates until now and it seems like very few men approach me. 
Truth is I want to start dating guys but I am a shy, chubby kinda-nerdy looking girl and I get anxious plus my college major leaves almost no time. I have tried creating profiles in Tinder and Happn but they don't seem to work and I have encountered a lot of sexual and rude comments. 
I appreciate any advice or suggestion. Have a nice day :)"
do,"Apparently it helps to write down what you are feeling, so here it goes.
I (m-22) started university at 18, and met what was my girlfriend in the first month, and we started dating. 

To cut all the details of our relationship, the only thing that is important is how that it ended (when telling this story). We dated for the whole time at university, spending all our time together, the only times we didn't, was during out of term time, when we went back to our respective homes. When the end of the three years at university came round, we agreed to make long distance work, and we spent a lot of time together over summer, and in November we hit 3 years together. Unfortunately, this is when things started going wrong.
Her mobile phone broke, and the only way I could contact her was by ringing her house phone, in the middle of December though, she stopped picking up the phone, I got through to her parents, who said that she was too busy to talk. A week went past without talking, and I was slightly concerned, but she had been extremely busy applying for post graduate work.

I was working night shifts, and was completely messed up, and at the end of the night shifts, on Christmas eve, I managed to get through to her, on facebook no less.
She said that after ignoring me, that she was was thinking that she wanted to move on. - I later found out that through the period of her ignoring me, she went out to a work dinner, and kissed or 'got kissed' as she said by possibly two people at the work party.
After I found this out a bit later, I insisted that we meet up, and sort out the relationship, and she agreed. I set off the following day to drive the 5 hours to her house, only to be called about 3 hours in, from her, telling me that I couldn't come. We argued for a bit, and then I argued with her father, and she hung up on me. I continued driving for a bit, unable to get through to her, and eventually turned back.

I got back home, and she spoke to me on facebook - she apologised, and said that she just needed space to think about what she wanted, and what was going to happen. At this point I was prepared to give her that.
I gave her space, and one night at one in the morning, I got a phone call from her in a pub / night club. She said something about she felt horrible about something. She then hung up on me, and when I rang her back, I got through to someone that wasn't her, and she was refusing to talk to me.

I now knew that her phone was working, without her telling me, and I eventually got through to her, and she said that she wanted more time to think over things.
She then spoke to me on facebook after a few days, saying that she wanted to see me, but she just wanted more time. So I thought that after dragging this all out, we would soon be able to see the end of this incident.
She then went back to hiding from me, and another week not talking passed. I rang her phone, and she immediately hung up on me. I managed to get convince her to talk to me, so we could sort this out. I admitted to her on the phone that since university, I had been struggling with depression, and in that week, I had started medication. She agreed that she would put whatever she was feeling in the back for a bit, and try and support me. - It lasted 3 days before she stopped talking again.
I texted her at the end of the week, and I got through to her, she said that throughout all the of this, she didn't want to be with me, or be with anyone for that matter, she just wanted to be by herself, so I agreed to give her some space, and we could hopefully just sort this out.
I found out on Sunday just gone, that she was seeing the same person that she got with at the Christmas party, throughout the whole time this was going on. It was none de script, but I am pretty sure that she was sleeping with him.
I spoke to her yesterday finally, in her lunch break. I was so upset and hurt. She said to me that she said in December that she wanted to move on, and I wasnt allowing her. I pointed out that she had changed her mind, and said that she did want to see me, and that she only wanted space. The conversation led to a lot of anger on both sides, and we ended it. She claimed that it had been ended for months, and I had been dragging the whole thing out. 

If I take a step back from it, I can understand that I did drag it out, but only because I was so upset about after the 3 most amazing and happiest years of my life, she would want to dump me through facebook, and not have the decency to do it face to face. 

I don't hate her, I just hate what she has done to me, and the way she acted. I want to move forward, but I never got closure from the relationship, all I learnt is that she wanted to move on.

I know it is early days after the break up, and I want to move on, I just feel trapped, after all she has done, I can admit that I still love her. I just need to get past her. I have read some of other peoples stories on here, and I know time will heal things. I may start the gym, and just do anything to take my mind off things."
do,"I made friends with a guy many years ago who was very kind and lovely, we were both going through hard teenage years with Narc and detached parents, he always had FLEAS, it would usually be things like ""Those pants make your butt look really bad"" just out of the blue criticism or even if it was something positive, it was only because it was better than something else ""Wow you look so much better when you shave"" (I have PCOS and had hair in unusual places like my lower back, it was my Nº1 insecurity) but as I reflect upon it now, it never hurt the relationship for me, I was so used to criticism I only thought he was right. As we grew up and I introduced him to people (he never had any friends) he started bonding with another RBN friend and they started getting cocky and really unpleasant, so I went NC for a couple of years, every time I reconnected with that group I would feel uncomfortable, they are all RBN for a couple of exceptions, so I also felt like I belonged. It wasn't until this summer I got close to them again, they are all in college right now and I felt they were really changed, nice people, so I started hanging out with them a lot. It spiraled quickly into conversations of purely criticizing others by shallow details. This one particular friend though, I realize now, has blown into a full Narcissist, and had been feeding on me this whole time while giving me more FLEAS I thought I got rid off in the past,I tried going NC again but yesterday he saw me and started talking to me and I am so angry I didn't got the fuck away from there, there's this strange comfort that I get from Narcs because that's what I'm used to, and making new friends is so hard because I don't know how to interact with healthy people, I'm always so afraid I will bore them or scare them by being awkward. Thank you if you read this and do you guys have the same issues? How do you cope with that? I'm determined to go NC for sure, even if he's clingy and persistent as always, but I'm afraid of running into this kind of situation in the future, I'm terrified of attracting more Npeople."
do,"This is going to be kind of long and I apologize, but i need help more than anything right now. is my first post on reddit, so forgive me for any formatting errors as I am typing this on my phone. Although i've been a longtime lurker of alot of different subreddits. I'm a 16 year old male from thw United States. I already posted it in a few other reddits, but I need as much help as I can get right now.

  I'm going to start from the beginning. Over the course of my whole life, i've never really had many health problems, mentally or physically. Around 2 years ago i was diagnosed with ADHD and mild OCD, but that's about it. I've pretty much been 100% happy over my past 16 years of living. Over the course of the past month, my life has been completely turned upside down.

  I don't want anyone to judge, but on New Years Eve, I smoked way too much weed with my friends. All my friends that I was with smoke weed basically everyday so they were fine, but I tried to keep up and ended up having way too much for my tolerance. What happened that night was that I got way too high, and had a huge panic attack. I am fully convinced that marijuana triggered all of these symptoms I am going to tell you guys about inside of me.

  The next day I woke up, and felt completely disconnected from the world. I was worried about everything and i had so much anxiety, and then i went home and fell asleep. I woke back up and i had this nonstop anxiety of just wondering if everything was real or not. I was having all these existental thoughts and my skin was crawling. Whenever i touched something, i got the feeling of pins and needles. I was literally freaking out so much and i had no clue what to do.

 After two days, I cracked and told my parents everything. I dealt with that for 2 days straight until I finally couldn't take it anymore and I told my mom and dad everything. They took me to the doctors and my pediatric physician (I know I could have gone to a therapist but I needed a referral from my physician for that anyways) told me it was a mix of anxiety and depersonalization. She told me that it was temporary and it was just from smoking and that it would go away really quickly. That day what she said put my mind at ease, and i felt completely better and 100% myself for a few weeks.

 Exactly one week ago, everything came back. Over Martin Luther King Day weekend I had a huge panic attack for no reason before going to sleep. Ever since then I've had recurring feelings of depersonalization and anxiety on and off throughout the days since then. Now, I'm going to move on to the hell I went through last night, which is what drove me to post here on this subreddit.

  Lately, I have been feeling like my thoughts have been leading me into depression. It has felt like I'm falling into a bottomless pit, and it's at its worst when I'm not really doing anything and it's just me and my thoughts.

 Last night I was at work, and all of a sudden I had a huge anxiety attack again. It happened after my mind was racing and nonstop thinking about what has been going on over this past month. I don't want any of you to think i'm fucking crazy or anything, but along with suicidal thoughts I got urges to hurt others. I would see someone and think ""kill them""... I know I would never act on this, but it occurs to me that I am capable of doing those things, as anyone is. That's what instills the most fear in me, the fact that I These thoughts came along with different voices in my head, which i've attributed to manic depression/psychotic depression after a little bit of research. My anxiety got worse and worse because I was worried that I was becoming a schizophrenic. These intrusive thoughts were nonstop. This scared me a lot because I'm not a lunatic. I'm a normal 16 year old boy. I'm easygoing, I have a loving family and a great group of friends, and I enjoy skateboarding all the time. I've never had thoughts like this before. 

  I kept getting myself more and more worked up because they wouldn't stop. It got so bad that I was shaking in fear. If I was talking to someone it would stop, but if it was just me thinking everything would start right back up again.

  I got out of work, and I told my mom that she needed to bring me to the hospital because I was feeling suicidal. She broke down crying, as any mother would, and her and my dad brought me to the ER. When I was there, these thoughts seemed to stop. The thoughts and ""voices"" only really come when I'm not occupied or not really doing much. The voices aren't my own, but they seem to convey my thoughts that I have if that makes any sense. It's very hard to explain unless you are going through it. Anyways, after explaining to the ER nurse that I was suicidal, the hospital changed me into paper scrubs and put me in a room with a security guard.

  There were two other kids in there, but once they left it was just me and the security guard. We got to talking, I didn't tell her everything, but I told her that I was anxious, depressed, and had some suicidal thoughts. She explained to me about how she was depressed when she was younger and they gave her medication to help it, and now she has a great life. What she said gave me hope.

  Finally, a nurse came and brought me into a room to see a psychiatrist and my parents. The psychiatrist had my parents leave the room to talk to me. I didn't tell her everything, although I'm wondering if I should have. They let me go home around 3AM, I went to bed, and now I woke up and I'm laying here typing this. I just need some reassurance here guys. I feel so alone and I feel like this is never going to get better, plus I needed to get all of this off my chest. Has this happened to anyone else before? And if so, what helped it? Anything at this point, I just want all of this to go away so I can be happy again. Depersonalization is a terrifying thing, but I'd rather have that than this."

I'm 19 and have a GED, and work at mainly retail places. Lately, my parents have been pushing me to either find a higher wage or better pay so I can try to spread my wings and get an apartment, and I want that too - but here's the thing - my current job, not so much. Let me explain.

Average rent in my area is 800 a month for a studio, and I get paid like this:

11.50 an hour for anywhere from 10-40 hours a week.

Problem one is that my bosses (I have two) refuse to give me a set schedule, so I end up with shifts like 1-10 pm one day and 7-10 am the next, making me exhausted beyond belief. The attendance policy is 4 call ins and you're fired in a six-month period, and they will give points for ANYTHING. Literally - one of the other girls in my department went into labor on the job and they fired her for it. LITERALLY. Needless to say, it's an insecure, stressful area with just that. Favoritism is super high as well - I've been there five months and yet the newest hire we have, right out of orientation, was promoted on his third day of work. Everyone kisses up to the managers and those who don't are often fired for some odd reason. They come up with reasons like 'low performance' or miraculously yell at people for non-existent attendance mistakes. Honestly, sometimes I'm scared to clock in for fear of losing my job like the others. On average, my department has a three-week turnover rate for new hires and our longest member on staff is only one year, and they want to leave. I gross well under 1000 a month and there really is no chance of me ever being promoted - also we are made to work crazy overtime, like ten hours plus a week, which according to company policy, is the 'norm.' Still, I find this all very frustrating and see no way to stably support myself off of this job. My other retail job that I left for declining health was never this bad in any way, excepting the physical intensity, but still, I feel unhappy and am in a bad situation. 

So, basically, I would like some advice as to what to do. Thank you. &lt;3

do,"I'm currently a senior in my undergrad at university studying software engineering. After receiving an internship this past summer in my field, I think it hit me I was in the wrong field. Prior to this summer, I have taught kids computer science every summer through a summer camp I directed. In my internship, I worked in a cubicle from 8-4 and felt like I had sold my soul to corporate America. Also, there is not a tech industry where I'm from, so no matter where I worked in tech I would be far from home. 
  
But, I'm a senior so it's too late to change my major to education. My school has an alternate route where I can get a Master of Arts in teaching, but CS is not a subject I can get my licensure in. I have to have 21 hours in a subject to get licensure, and I don't have 21 hours in any subject you can get licensure in. I have 12 hours of math credits, but business is closer to what I'd want to teach. Also, math is probably my weakest subject, so I'd be nervous about teaching it to young minds.
  
The biggest part came when I told my dad, who said that he felt like I would be wasting my degree if I came to school and got an engineering degree only to be a teacher, among the fact that I already have a job making a lot more money lined up with the corporate company. 
  
So, now upon being conflicted about math or business, I'm even more worried about disappointing my dad but I just *know* I won't be happy eight and a half hours from home slaving away in a cube even if the paychecks are nice.

do,"When I was about 13 my parents pulled me out of school to instead do ""homeschooling"". While they deny ever having said it, it was for religious reasons. My mother was supposed to do most of the teaching and my dad would step in ( after work ) and teach the more complicated subjects. 

That worked well for maybe a year or two. During that time my mother got cancer and any kind of schooling was dropped entirely. Being a kid I didn't care about not doing school work, just meant more free time for me. I didn't start to really grasp how bad things could get in regard to my education until I was about 17. I realized I was supposed to be graduating around this time, but I was nowhere near that. Any attempt at asking if I could return to a real school was met with disappointment. 

A few months after I turned 18 I was diagnosed with depression. Around that same time my parents told me I had somehow graduated, not knowing anything about how homeschooling officially worked, I believed them. 



I am 21 now, crippled by depression and anxieties. Little to no social skills and no work history. Today I randomly decided to look up the official website for my ""homeschooling"". I typed my mother's email and the password I assumed they used to log in and it worked. I checked various things and came to the realization that I never actually did graduate high school. All these years they have lied to my face.

A lot of people find this very amusing but when the conversation changes to something more sincere, any attempts I make to contribute are brushed off. 

I find myself often being ignored in group conversations even when the points I make contribute to the conversation. It's like people expect everything that comes out of my mouth to be irrelevant nonsense and I'm not treated as an equal. This even happens when I'm with friends, though when I'm 1:1 this obviously isn't an issue.

I have been diagnosed with dysthymia and PTSD and I recently talked my way out of seeing my psychologist any longer because I just don't feel comfortable talking about these things in person and I find it to be somehow easier to share it on the internet. I was adopted at birth and a vega test recently showed that I've had a birth trauma which caused my PTSD and depression. This was either due to a lack of oxygen or my mother never got to see me/didn't want to see me when I was born, but I don't have enough information about that.

I absolutely hate living like this and having to face everyone getting along and having fun everyday (I'm still in school) while not knowing what makes me different. I truly don't know what makes them not like me and it makes me *so* insecure. I genuinely don't know how to talk to people, or how to start a conversation, or how to make friends because I feel like I've never had any friends.

I also fucked up three of my years in school because I have no motivation at all and once I'm home from school I'm exhausted and sleep until dinner and then I sleep until the next morning. That's how every day of my life goes, except for the weekends when I just sleep all day long. I've kind of given up and been doing literally nothing with my life for the past four years.

I don't know where I'm going with this story or what the point was. I guess I'm just looking for someone to talk to. An internet friend. It felt good sharing my story for the first time though, even if no one reads this. If you read this all the way through, thank you for taking the time. I'm just really *really* lonely.

One of the major factors was not being able to open up about emotions.

But looking back, there has been red flags for a while. On the first date, he mentioned his ex's alot! They were apparently""crazy"" which is never true 99% of the time but I just ignored it. He fails to support me in anything. And to top it off, I gave him money to borrow and he gets annoyed when I ask for it back. 

Like looking at it, I shouldnt put up with it but I don't know why I do! If my friend was having this done to them I would tell them to go before there trapped in an unhappy relationship. It sounds stupid but when he's nice to me or makes time for me, I forget all the bad stuff. What should I do? Can I save the relationship?

First off, how would you protect against STDs while using a double sided dildo/vibrator?
Secondly, does the Dental Dam slip much during intercourse? What's it like?
Thirdly, is there anything else out there that you can tell me about?
Fourth, would it be too intrusive for me to ask about your sexual preferences, and how you prefer to have sex? If not, then that'd be really awesome.

do,"I'm a Masters student in EE in a prestigious program in my country. I took up the thesis option. I've been working with a decently famous prof (good prior research in reputed conferences and journals) and a very nice person. Recently, I've hit a block in my thesis work, ie I found out that the problem that I took up cannot be solved. This happened a couple of months ago too. Then my prof and I sat down and figured that a minor deviation from the direction we were taking then should actually help me in finishing it (do research, publish a paper and defend thesis). But I found that even that cannot be solved. 

My advisor is now saying that using these concepts in a similar area to solve problems might be the direction to take, though we have not finalized on it. But the problem I find with that is that in the newer direction, I built the current state-of-art system and I'm pretty sure that to increase the performance any more would only be engineering hacks and nothing of newer ideas. It is around time that I graduate. Most of my peers will be graduating in a few more months. 

What do I do? Can you please advice in this regard?

Edit: I'll probably add a few more details too. I'm a fairly decent student ( decent grades in courses). I joined this program, turning down various offers elsewhere because this was the program that funded me from day one. I cannot shift to another course in my university. I've been diagnosed with clinical depression recently and have been coping up with it. This new problem of mine, is depressing me even more. Not a lot of people knew about my prior depression but they have all been noticing and saying stuff, but I didn't want to share it with them, so I just brushed them off. I really didn't want to take up a job after my undergrad, and really wanted to study further. I had my plans focused on a good PhD school. I'll add any other details when someone asks for them."
do,"I'm sick of crying, feeling depressed, and ruining every relationship I have. 

My ex broke up with me about a month ago. Last week he said he wanted to work on us getting back together. He started calling and texting me a bunch, like nothing ever happened. I was so happy. We were sweet talking and having phone sex. He told me he loved me and missed me. He called and texted any minute he got. 

That lasted 2 days. As the week went on, I heard from him less and less. Now he says he doesn't want us to get back together and that he's been avoiding my calls and texts because I make him feel ""suffocated"".  I would call him once a day and he would say something like ""I'm swamped. Let's talk tomorrow!"" or ""We'll talk tomorrow"" but would never call me. Another time he said he ""forgets"" and asks that I be flexible with him. 

So I called him today because it had been 4 days of ""Let's talk tomorrow"" texts. And I tried and tried to resist the urge to call him, and wait for him to call me, but come 7:00pm every evening I would impulsively call him because I missed him. 

So today I called him in the afternoon (and it's not that I call him multiple times a day; I've been calling once a day). He answered and we said our hellos, and I asked if everything was okay because we were so talkative, communicative, affectionate this weekend but now I haven't heard from him and I mentioned that if he needed space, I'd rather him tell me than give me ""let's talk tomorrow"" texts. He said that he thought it was ""implied"" and that I would ""get the hint"" that he needed space. Yet I don't know how ""Let's talk tomorrow"" and ""We'll talk tomorrow"" gives me the hint that he needs space. It tells me you're busy and we'll talk tomorrow! I even told him that I called because he told me he ""forgets"" and I figured I'd call him.

I don't know what to think. I'm devastated. I want to change. I don't want to make him, or anyone, feel like they're ""choking"" with me. He said when we talk he feels anxious. I asked what I was doing, I don't want him to feel that way, but he says he doesn't know. He said he feels like we're back in the relationship again. He says it shouldn't be so hard and that we shouldn't even be having this conversation.. But was I really out of line? This weekend he said he wanted to be with me, after a month without each other. It's like I've been broken up with all over again.

My therapist says I need to be happy with myself. I need to give him space, let him come to me, and not always be available when he does call. But I don't know what she means when she says be happy with myself. Especially when I'm diagnosed MDD and GAD. 

TLDR; Please help me find ways to change, to not be so ""needy"" and ""controlling"", especially when it comes with relationships. I want to change, I just don't know how. I'm so depressed and I can't stop crying."

do,"**TL:DR Woke up to a harsh aching/burning pain in my rectum; also noticed that my locked room door was broken and that all my valuables were missing. Clearly I was robbed, but was I raped too? Details below**

**Thank you in advance for reading the wall of text.**

There's been something that's been plaguing my mind over the past few years and which has been a contributing factor to, if not a main cause, of never-ending severe clinical depression(literally bed-ridden). I just can't figure it out and was hoping to get input from this community.

I'm an African-American male in my early 30's. Incident happened over a decade ago in my late teens/ early 20's(keeping my age vague for privacy purposes).

I was was traveling in a different part of the States. I clearly stood out. Due to mixed race heritage, I had a exotic look and what some would deem a 'feminine' appearance.

I was staying in a rented room of a house whose owners my family vaguely knew. I woke up one morning to a dreadful feeling: my butt, rectum area, to be specific was burning/aching harshly. The pain was like nothing I've ever felt. While digesting this realisation, I also realized that the locked door to my room was broken. I immediately checked my stuff and found that my suitcase was broken into and all the valuables(money, gifts) and documents(ID, passport) were taken. Edit: I don't have much memory(or any at all) of the preceding night; just a vague sense of disquiet and maybe a nightmare; again very vague, like something bad happened but I don't know what. Then again, maybe this ""created memories"", ie, since I was clearly robbed, is my brain trying to come up with ""memories"". I don't know.

Aftermath of incident: after i got back home, i fell into a 2 year-long depression where i did little but eat, sleep(hours upon hours), watch porn(never used to, 1st time starting was after incident). I developed and still have a heightened vigilance and startle reflex/response(but to be honest, I always had that). I had not-frequent nightmares and night terrors. I started and flunked out of numerous colleges. I got fired from every job I had.

A few years ago, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder(depressive type) and the symptoms(lengthy periods of deep depression + brief periods of hypomania) traced back to the period after the incident.

Approximately 4 years after the incident, I was chatting online when I got a IM message from one of the ""homies"" I was hanging around with during my travels and who was the last person who was in the house with me the night before the incident. I had strong suspicions(but no proof) that he had something to do with the break-in, as only somebody close to me would know the layout of the room, where my suitcase was, and where all my valuables were. Only valuable stuff was taken; nothing else was touched.

Anyway, he IM'd me. We started a conversation after not talking for 4 years. Conversation went bad for no reason; we started insulting each other; then, he sent me a email. When I opened it, I was so shocked that I literally jumped out of my chair. The email contained a random graphic porn photo(probably from the internet) of two males, one on all fours being penetrated from the back.

The only logical conclusion is that he was insulting and taunting me with what is, in our community, the ultimate insult for a male. But what else was he implying? That that's what happened to me that night? That he was behind it(he did it)? Or that he just heard it from the grapevine?

Based on everything I wrote, please give me your honest opinions: Was I raped? If the evidence is pointing towards the affirmative, then how come I don't remember anything at all? Was I drugged? Then how come I don't remember feeling groggy or ""druggy""?

I haven't spoken about this to anyone. The stigma is too strong. I've seen therapists and doctors but only for other issue(bipolar, etc), haven't spoken about this. I can't help but feel that the twin traumas of the robbery plus whatever else happened that night has affected my life tremendously. But then again, am I looking for a scapegoat for my failures? Would appreciate your honest, blunt opinion."
do,"So I don't know if anyone has experience with this for anything but SA is one of the weekends where alcohol is banned. That includes both drinking and carrying. Bags can be searched, pretty sure a mixer/water bottle could be sniffed if that is done.

Anyway, I know it's not hard to sneak alcohol on, but has anyone had experience with this? Do they search bags? Or is it more along the lines of just not being a nuisance and obvious drunk?

Thanks!"
do,"**Background:** I currently own a Boundless CF but I am looking to upgrade somewhat soon but not immediately (420 sales?).  I have no experience with any other vape and I have no friends who have a vape (they all combust). 

I almost exclusively vape alone or occasionally with my wife.  I almost always vape at the end of the day, when I have plenty of time to relax (so speed/power is not a huge issue).  I want a portable vape because I usually use it outside but not necessarily out and about (so it doesn't need to fit in my pocket -- besides, I'll still have a CF to use for portability -- stealth is NOT a huge deal).  I want a battery-powered vape because I don't want to mess with butane.  I am looking for a solid vape that's relatively easy to clean (another of my complaints about the CF -- it doesn't clean that well/easy).  I don't particularly worry about efficiency because my tolerance isn't that high.  I also like my things to last a long time.  I'd like to get better vapor/performance, if possible.

Based on all of my wants, I was thinking of getting an Arizer Solo because it's known to really reliable/durable.  BUT, what's the difference between the Solo and the Solo 2 and the Air and the Air 2?  Is there some other vape that I should consider (not by Arizer)?  

As far as I can tell with the newer Arizer offerings, you get digital temperature control (not a big need for me) and quicker/more powerful heating (I am not in a hurry).  Based on that, I don't see a need to spend the extra money for a Solo 2 or an Air 2.

Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks!"

do,"Hello Everyone, this is my first reddit post and I'm seeking for some advice.

I was diagnosed with depression. Last year, my mum told me that she found out that my dad was cheating on her. My dad had several girlfriends before but none of them were that serious. However, this one is different. My mother and I moved to the city when I was really young. She gave up her job and friends in-order for me to receive a better education. She sacrificed everything for me and we are really really close. My grandpa (mum's dad) was diagnosed with cancer 7 years ago and my mum spent most of her time back then with my grandpa (he passed away three years ago). I guess this is the reason why my dad started a relationship with another woman three years ago. My mum had no one to talk to, so I started to be her only listener. She would tell me all of her problems with my dad and I would be staying by her side supporting her. This continued for about 3 months. 



I was doing fine back then. Going back to school, living my normal life. But then as things continued, I too, became burnt out. I couldn't sleep at night. I feel like I'm having a hard time breathing. So I decided to meet this professional psychiatrist. She's really nice and she spent hours and hours talking to me. I started to take prescribed medication and another three months have passed. But I didn't feel any better at all. I would still hear my parents argue at night and I've been trying really really hard protecting my six year old brother from this. I used to cry myself to sleep every night, seeing my grades deteriorating and my friends becoming more and more distant from me. I started to feel the nothingness. I couldn't feel anything. Nothing at all, not even the sadness. I used to cry and had breakdowns every time my parents started to argue during midnight. But now, I just feel nothing at all. I couldn't feel angry nor sad, but just nothing. I couldn't feel happy and enjoy the things I used to do. I couldn't focus and my grades went straight down. I started to isolate myself. Lock myself in my room, not going to school and not talking to anyone. It's not that I don't want to talk to my friends, I just don't know how to anymore. They would send my messages everyday asking whether I'm doing fine or not. But I just don't know how to reply them and tend to ignore them all the time. They would say ""it will get better"", ""just hang in there"" and ""take care"" but I don't know why, I feel even more distant to them every time they say something like this to me. It's not like I don't want to thank them, it's just that I don't know how to react anymore. They've been really really supportive but I've let them down every single time. I've become more and more distant even from my closest friends. I feel like I've lost the ability to love, to learn and to interact with others. The only thing that I enjoyed, is locking myself in my own room.



 I tried talking to my mum but every time we started to talk, it will end-up as an argument. I understand that she's going through a lot more right now but I just wanted to talk to her. I wanted her to understand me. But every single time, she'll blame me for using my dad as an excuse for not getting good grades (or going to school). I took a month break from school, spending every day with my brother. Trying to play games with him and help him with his homework, picking him up after school and trying to protect him from what's happening. 2 weeks ago, I had an conversation with my mum and I told her that I will go back to school and will try as hard as I can to study and get my grades up. I really don't want her to worry that much. But as I start going back to school regularly, people will start asking questions. I don't want them to know what's happening and that I've been diagnosed with depression so I was constantly putting on the fake smile. I couldn't focus, I couldn't study and I don't even know how to talk to my friends. Going to school is a total mess. Yesterday night, I approached my mother, trying to tell her that I'm really really tired. But she scolded me and told me I'm using this parent thing as an excuse again. I had a total breakdown but I didn't say anything, I'm afraid that if I can't control my feelings, I might hurt her unintentionally.



 Today, I continued to go to school as my mum and I will get into another argument if I don't. I tried talking to my friends but all they said was asking me to ""stay strong"" and ""take care"". I understand that it's their way of caring but I just couldn't feel anything. I just wanted to cry every time they said something like this to me. I've been trying hard. Really really hard. But the nothingness, school, my parents affected me a lot. I just really really tired and lost. I don't meant to hurt anymore. But seeing my parents, friends all becoming more and more distant, I really don't know what to do. It hurts me every single time when my friends or family tried their best to encourage me but I'm just locking myself inside my room and pretending that everything is okay. 

I'm really sorry for the long text but I just don't know what to do anymore.

TL;DR 17. Found at that dad's cheating. Been going through depression and having problems both at school and at home."

I'm tired because when I desperately needed a place to stay in a different town, my friend who lives there didn't respond to my texts until I bribed her with dinner at an expensive restaurant, after which she ignored me until I left in the morning.

It's always been this way for me. I don't know what's wrong with me. I try to be friendly and nice to everyone, but no one ever reciprocates.  I don't know why people will only spend time with me if I go way out of the way to make it happen. I've always put up with it because having shitty friends is better than having no friends at all, but I don't have the financial resources to be treated like shit anymore. Is everyone this shitty? I had to leave college and spend this semester at home because of my depression, and all these people know this. Having friends finally start coming home just to ignore me isn't helping."

All I've ever been able to find with my resume are dead end jobs or entry level stuff. I know my work history basically sucks, I've bounced around to different cities and worked a lot of different jobs.

The working on PCs as a self-employed individual isn't a lie, but it is a stretch, I've usually just helped friends set up networks, built custom gaming PCs for people, helped fix OS issues, and other things of that nature.

Ideally I'd like to get my foot in the door at a real tech company of some kind, my current job consists of using pre-written replies to answer users emails all day long, and there's no upward mobility unless you're chummy with and/or dating the management.

I really want to start making at least $35k a year, ideally more than that, but I'm at a total loss here.

truthfully, i feel like i've repressed memories of him making me do these things. i was 5, after all, and i'm now 15. he was around 10 at the time, now 20. it was not fully rape, i feel as though i should say that right now. nonetheless, it happened and went on for two years. sometimes i think that i've made this up to get attention. i honestly cannot say that it happened for sure, but i don't think that 'do not let men touch you in places they shouldn't' is a normal thing to say to your 9 year old daughter when she goes to her best friend's house for a sleepover. that's the only way i can validate the situation and know that it probably happened.

my case isn't as severe as most of the others on this subreddit, and for that i am thankful. i've only told three people outside of the situation about this, and they're people that i'd trust with my life. i have a therapist because of mental health issues, but i'm not sure if i should tell her. this situation probably has nothing to do with my depression and low self esteem. i just want an adult's opinion. i'm scared to talk to my parents about it. i don't want my brother to get in trouble legally. i care about him too much. the real question is why i care.

i have a lot of mixed up thought's about this, and i'd really appreciate any advice for how to approach my therapist about this (since she was introduced to me by my brother. they're good friends.). thank you."

You have depression like I do.

You would text me asking shyly to hang out, and you'd call me cutie.

You showed a sincerity I've never had a guy do before.

do,"Apologies for formatting, I seriously don't know how to make this not look like one giant wall of text. I am a 27 y/o female currently working in the culinary field. I've always been a great cook (now chef) but never had much passion for the actual work. I am fully aware that jobs and work will not always be fun, but as a ""young"" female in a small New England town I've spent the last seven years being doubted, demeaned, and paid too little because I'm a female. I've always gotten by somehow, and within the last two years I found myself in a position to accept a management job that paid a decent salary for someone my age ($45k, because this is the internet and who the f cares who knows what). In this industry, with the degree I have (Associates in Culinary Arts) I feel overwhelmingly limited. I spent 6 years in an unhealthy relationship putting my happiness and career on the back burner and I'm still coming out of those clouds two years later. The job I have currently is good, but I'm never truly happy. I never feel like I can be myself (this is a much deeper, unrelated to work issue - ain't nobody got time for that) and I'm always trying to be someone I know deep down I am not.


I've always had this need to be great, make something of myself and do things. Actually live my life and get out of this small town. Due to previously mentioned deeper issues I hardly ever voice my opinion or do what I want. I don't want to blame this entirely on Middle Child Syndrome but lets be real. Just kidding. 


I've been out of work for a few months (medical reasons) and won't return until May/June. I know. That *is* a ton of unpaid time off to contemplate life and happiness. My family thinks I am losing my mind (seriously) but I want to become a screenwriter. Which involves going back to school (anywhere from 20 months to 4 years).
I've always had a passion for creative writing and originally wanted to go to college to major in English or Creative Writing. I love writing. Creating characters and emotions and impossibly possible situations. I've always loved the art behind the scenes of television and movie making. All of that fun ""I want to inspire people and make them laugh and make a difference to someone"" baloney. That's me.


Am I crazy? Is this a terrible idea? Is there a better subreddit to post this in? I'm looking for advice from fellow ladies who have changed careers. What was your experience like? Reaction from your family/suppport system? 


TLDR; 27 y/o professional in culinary field. No true happiness/sense of accomplishment from current field of work. Thinking of going back to school for screenwriting due to my passion for creative writing despite never really voicing this to anyone. Fear of returning to school, debt, people thinking I'm crazy, failure, etc. Also tired of existing and not truly living."

All of my friends look like the beautiful girls who people reblog on tumblr all the time and I look so fucking dumpy and homely. Thin, long hair, amazing clothes, wealthy, and always with a man. Especially this one particular friend of mine, holy crap she is beautiful. I was out partying this weekend. Looking back at the photos on FB made me cringe. I'm the odd girl out. I'm the gross looking one. Plus, every guy there was asking about my two friends and I was completely over-looked :(




Every guy I've been hooking up with seemed to be embarrassed to be with me. I'm not pretty enough to be worthy of the 'girlfriend' title. There were guys that couldn't even get it up with me! So embarrassing.



It's not because I don't work out, I'm on a competitive sports team (won't say which). It's because of food. There was a point in time when I was in high school where I was diagnosed EDNOS, with mostly anorexic tendencies. I felt invincible. I was in control of my appearance. I looked damn good, too! Being my height, people would always stop and ask me if I was a model. I want to go back to that. ESPECIALLY this summer, considering I'm going to a college next year that's basically all beautiful people (guys and girls).

Even then, they'll tell me, ""you've said that five times omg!"" They always invite eachother places but I'm never invited and they don't show up if I invite them out.


Also, they make fun of me, like call me stupid and stuff, and make fun of my transgender twin. Sometimes I say something and they'll start whispering and laughing and saying ""we're going away now"" and go somewhere else.
  
Also, I feel devalued. I buy them birthday presents, I get nothing from them. They talk bad about everyone whenever they leave the room and I'm thinking they're doing that to me.

do,"I'm a jealous kind of guy. I try my best to not show it and keep it under wraps pretty well i think for the most part but sometime there is some things I just dont' find acceptable. 

So i thought i'd as you guys what you think about this scenario and if you think it is acceptable and what to do about it.

I've been with my girlfriend for a year and 4 or 5 months. We broke up for about a month but still had a sexual relationship and hung out a lot (almost as if we never broke up). We settled our differences and talked and decided to get back together. She didn't want to at first because she claimed that i wasn't family oriented, she is younger than me (19) i'm 24 and wants to still explore, live life and reconnect with family and friends and being commited to someone for life right now seems like a lot. She also said she as scared that she would be too dependant on me for her happiness like she was before and she wanted to keep her old connections or something along those lines.

Today while we had dinner at her place i noticed a guy texted her and she knew i saw and decided to mention him that he was a co-worker and they take the same class and sometimes catches a ride to their work which is 5 minutes away.

This bothers me because I rarely believe that guys and girls can be friends unless they were friends from way way back that had no sexual ties or experiences with one another, then maybe. Other than that i don't believe guys and girls make friends with each other unless they find the other one somewhat attractive in some way. What should i think of this? is it acceptable?

I should also mention that she was going through her snapchat when we were laying together and said she was going to check it quick and had 2. One she opened from one of her friends and the other was a guy but she didn't open that one in front of me. I asked why that was later on and she said that he just always asks where the parties are and doesn't want him to know that she opened it cos he'll bug her. I believed her but again seems odd that she chooses to open certain snaps and not others. I never ask to see her phone and snoop through or anything. Sometimes she seems opena bout me seeing her phone but not always open about what i see specifically. She's not stupid either so if she wanted to be sneaky about anything she'd hide it well.

Maybe i am being paranoid i just need others opinions."

Anyways. One of my cousins is living in Canada right now. And she wrote something in English in her Facebook. My grandma was so pissed and offended. Said it was rude of my cousin to write in English cause my grandma couldn't understand it. I tried explaining to her that the message was meant for her friends in Canada who likely don't speak any Spanish. She was still offended and even asked me to translate what was being said.

However my mental health hasn't been the best. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and hospitalized voluntarily once. I opted to get ECT to help me deal with depression. 

The ECT helped and I currently take two anti depression medications.

However recently to go to this college required moving six hours from my parents. I have worked jobs before, take care of my chores etc. but never lived on my own. I've been here for 30 days and I haven't seen my parents for three weeks.

I find myself feeling very very sad here in this new place. Despite having made a few friends already what I need is the hug of my mom or dad or brother.

I was recently also broken up with, we dated for one year and we both made mistakes and we were very close. Losing her made me feel very alone especially. She lives back in my old town six hours away.

I find myself very depressed without daily interaction with people I'm very close with. I need day to day interaction with my mom or dad or brother or up to recently my ex. 

Now here I am all alone in this apartment six hours away and though I have met people. It does nothing to cure the sadness inside me. It only goes away when people I love are in my life day to day.

Because of how sad I am, I can no longer focus on my school work and I've lost motivation to study and exert myself.

I want to go home, go back to my parents get a job and perhaps date and move out once I've found somebody to do that with.

My sadness is getting to breakdown levels and random crying and talking to myself.

Should I go home or push myself to adapt and try and cope for at least six months? It's just I feel so sad day to day don't know what to do. Don't want to give up my dream either."

 ""Fuck"" was my only thought for the next five hours. I don't know how/if I can continue my life. And also there is so much against the claim. But still a lot to support it. The social things in life has never come easy for me. I have friends, had girlfriends although it has never come naturally. It took a while and even now I have some issues with it (might be the depression). But at the same time, I was one of the best salesmen at my last company. I have close to no other symptom other than the social bit. Although I have always been the good one in class and never really felt that I fitted in. Even though I had friends and was social.

As from the thoughts about me that I have been better and better now without any struggles. My life has been so perfect and I can overcome challenges by myself. However, she just tries to look at me in a distance. She doesn't want to make any connections with me but being a third person to look at a drawing. She is also happy with her life, too. But still, she doesn't want to make any moves. Just keep the things like this. About the feeling I'm not sure. I guess that because of some rough time + the destiny that we are not meant to be together, she just doesn't want to find the way to work this out. I mean I want to be friend with her again since I have moved on now but this is hard lol."
do,"Okay so here's the general gist:

My boyfriend and I (we are both 18) have been together for 1.5 years long distance and other than our few arguments (which almost always arise from the same issue mentioned in the title) we have a very good relationship. We are always together, we enjoy the same things, and I would personally say that we make a very strong team in terms of in both a friendship and a romantic relationship. 

However, we've recently had yet another argument about the same thing that we always seem to argue about: that I don't listen. Yesterday he was asking me to give a call to one of our mutual friends to come join us for a get-together in the evening but I didn't want to call him because I knew he (the friend) was occupied at the moment and would not be able to come regardless. My boyfriend told me that if he couldn't come he'd just say so but I get anxious about phone calls (I know, it's kind of stupid) so I said it was pointless if we BOTH knew that he was busy at the time anyway. He then proceeded to get upset with me and gave me the silent treatment for an entire day and it continued to today until he sent me a message on Facebook and I thought he wanted to reconcile.

But nope.

As soon as the silent treatment ends he accuses me of never listening to him, that I ""hear"" and don't ""listen"", and that to be able to ""listen"" to him I have to agree and act upon what he says. Now I understand what he's saying but I WAS listening to him last night; the only reason I didn't act on it was that I disagreed. So naturally I told him that and then he accuses me of being defensive of my own ego and became very pretentious, saying that I was only proving him his own point and that I was ignorant, etc. I know for a fact that I have my own problems and I am not a perfect person, but I think it's unreasonable for him to always expect me to agree with him in order to listen. By his logic, he wants me to ""listen"" to him, but his idea of ""listening"" involves ""agreeing"", and I don't think it's natural for me to always have to agree with him. He also gets very pretentious and self-absorbed when we are trying to communicate and tries to knock me down by saying I'm ignorant or defensive or that my argument is shit. I just don't feel that it's right. So I guess the title is a bit misleading because I know that neither one of us are 100% in the wrong, and that each of us have things we need to improve upon but I do want to know if I'm just being melodramatic. I will admit that I do get upset very easily when he becomes this way and it hurts my feelings a lot. Communication today ended up being a fail because he demonstrated from the beginning that he was intent on blaming me for something I knew wasn't entirely my fault. I'm not perfect and neither is he. I just want to get some feedback because the whole situation is confusing me and I don't know how I can approach things. Thanks.

At the end, I'll also list where I am right now (am no longer living at home). Please let me know if I should rewrite anything, and thank you in advance for listening to me everybody.)


What I am looking for:

So basically, I'm having trouble emotionally handling everything that is happening around me.
I am here asking for emotional support, and how the HECK I can keep my chin up?

Did I grow up in an abusive household?

How is my outlook on all this?

Am I crazy?

Am I a bad person?

Am I a bad daughter? 

Am I just 'taking shit' about them?

Should I be scared? Because I'm just so scared.


I've learned that I have a positive outlook compared to them, and all my friends (who know my family) do not like my family members. My best friend of 10+ years, who has grown up with me, has been great with giving me honest opinions on if I am correct when I say that my family members are miserable, sad people, or if I am being too harsh on them (hint: she thinks they are miserable, sad people and that it's not my fault). 


Short background of the issue?..:

Ever since I can remember, my parents have had a bad relationship. I can only remember seeing them kiss once. I'm not sure if they stayed together for the kids, or because my mother is afraid of being alone and always hoped that my dad would make good money again. I think now she just feels stuck. 
I've normally always been able to handle their rainstorm relationship- in a 'it is what it is' kind of way. But I have a very small family, and only one set of grandparents. Now that my grandparents are in an Assisted Living Facility and are dying, its causing SO much more negative energy around us. I have a mother and father, one younger sister, one set of grandparents[late 80s], one aunt and uncle[late 60s], and two older cousins in their 30s. 


Everyone in my family has always been very negative. There was never a happy day in the house when I lived there, and still isn't now that I am back here, visiting for two months. They never smile, do not talk to each other, even the house is always dark- they don't like to turn the lights on. They claim that they cannot afford to go to a therapist, and instead they just do the same thing every day, in our dark house (they draw the curtains closed even if its a beautiful day out, like it was today!). They don't speak to each other very nicely, and I've learned how to have a healthy relationship by trying to NOT be like them.


Ok. Let's start with mom. This will be THE longest one, and all after them will be very short, I promise. :)


Mom: 

My mom grew up in an abusive household. She was the youngest of like 8 kids, and she says that she doesn't know if they were all even born to the same father, because her mother always had different boyfriends. She has always been vague with her answers about how exactly it was abusive. My sis and I, while growing up, always tried prying out of her what exactly happened to her as a kid...what the heck was so terrible that she doesn't talk to anyone anymore? I have never met my mother's parents, I don't even know their names. Her mother died when I was around 10 I think. Of our family, only she went to the funeral. Also, her father recently died- and she wasn't able to go to the funeral because no one told her about it (her father left her mother when my mom was young. He got remarried, and years later tried getting in touch with my sister and I. My mom gave me letters that he had sent us, but I personally refused to write back to him because he abandoned my mom when she was little. My mom found out that he died, because the ONE sister that she still keeps in touch with found out through Facebook that he had died. His new wife (the one that he married after he left my mom's mother) did not tell any of his 'other' kids (my mom and her siblings) about his funeral. 

When my mom was 13, she ran away, because all her siblings had moved out of the house. The police found her a years later, and when they tried to bring her back to her mom, my mom's mom said ""if you bring her back I'll kill her"" so my mom went into foster care.

If you've seen the movie White Oleander, the daughters journey with Foster Care families is exactly like my moms (as my mom has said). All bad, abusive, etc. She moved out of her last one at 18, never had much money, and spent over 10 years graduating with her bachelors cuz she couldn't afford to live and go to school. Met my dad in her 30s, got married, had two kids.


When I was growing up, my mom was always a very anxious person. My sister and I used to jokingly make fun of her, because she was always afraid of us 'getting raped'. We weren't allowed to do anything. She was very strict with what we did and where we went- but it was in a ""my mother is very, very scared something will happen to us"" kind of way. As teenagers, the reason why we couldn't go to a concert was not because we were too young, but because we ""would get raped"". Things like that. Now, as an adult, I see it's no joking matter, and I don't know why she always had such fear. She would always jump from 0-100 with anything. If we fell, she would scream. I became a very dramatic teenager, and my sister and I both developed severe anxiety. We were constantly afraid of doing anything. My mom has a sick sense of humor, and now sarcastically jokes that she grew up always thinking she was just a worrywart, but it turns out it was anxiety. ""Whoops!"" She'll say. My sis and I have told her she should get therapy, but she always makes up an excuse not to. 


Also, my mother has made clear to us, and my father, that she married him because she wanted kids and he had a good job. She wanted to be a stay at home mom, and blamed him for the fact that she ended up having to work, and now she REALLY blames him because she is in her 60s and is the sole provider of the household. She has always ""hated her job"", with every job she has ever had. She always encouraged my sis and I to marry rich, that way we would never have to work. Surprise surprise- my sis and I love working and are both in the Human Rights sector and love working and learning. But when we were teenagers, she was always impressed if a boy drove up with a nice car. Or was from a good town. Her reasoning behind this was ""Marry him and you'll never have to worry about a thing!"" 


I guess I'll also say that I feel like she always takes other peoples problems, and makes them her problems. When my sis actually came out as Lesbian, my mom blamed herself and said it was because my sis was bullied in school and that my mom didn't do enough to stop it. When I was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome as a child, my mom thinks its her fault and has apologised my entire life for it (it does NOT affect my life whatsoever! I have it only lightly. People don't even know unless I tell them.) My mom blames my father for all of her problems, and blames herself for her childrens problems. All my life I've always heard her say ""This isn't how I wanted my life to be"". 


My analysis:

 I think, bottomline, my mom should have gotten therapy before she got married and had kids. I think my sis and I developed issues growing up because of her. Looking back on my childhood with adult eyes, I realise now that she overreacted with any issue that my sis and I had. I once got mad at her that I couldn't go out with my friends, and so she threw herself on the ground, started pounding the floor with her fists (exactly like a toddler) and cried. It really scared me. It was like she never expected having teenagers to be difficult. Sometimes I blame her for her own issues, sometimes I blame her for my own issues growing up, and sometimes I feel its not her fault at all and she's just a child trapped in an adults body, who never got to grow up.


Dad:

Dad is a loser. I love my dad, but he's a loser. I always went back and forth on whether or not I thought he was a shitty dad or not, but now I realize he has always been a great dad, but a bad husband. 


My dad never says anything bad about my mom. To this day, he says that he loves her, but I've never heard my mom say that to my dad. He always says that my mom is SUCH a good mom, and that she loves us. Constantly praises her. Once when I was younger, I woke up to them fighting in the morning, and he was yelling at my mom, saying ""You won't even hold my hand anymore!"". Now, my dad also hates working. He lost his job because of the economy crash when I was younger, and ever since then he couldn't hold down a job. I grew up not realising that- I just thought my dad had all these cool jobs. He was a bartender, worked at concert venues, invested in Start-ups, and worked a lot of blue collar jobs that teenagers worked. He makes me mad, because he'll try to open up to me, and tell me about how he hates working and just doesn't want to anymore. Yet the same day, he'll tell my mom that he can't WAIT to start working again and was looking for jobs all day. Additionally, I've learned that he is a kiss-ass and is very gullible (finally I know where I got that from!). He always thinks something is a good deal, is easy to fool, and gets way too excited about the possibilities of...any potential job/scenario that could bring in a lot of money. My father is a dreamer and doesn't realise he is dreaming until he is rudely woken up. He also has a BAD temper and tries to solve anything by yelling. He's been fired for saying 'Fuck you' to his boss. When my parents found out I was watching porn as a teenager, he screamed at me and foamed at the mouth (it was, of course, only spit! He was so busy yelling I don't think he remembered to take a breath and swallow), and threw a chair across the room. He has never hit me, but I bet its because my mom didn't let him. He has shook me very hard before, and tapped his fingers against my head very hard when asking me ""What were you thinking?"" My dad doesn't raise his voice, he screams. If he is on the phone with some kind of customer service, he has a 'spiel' of some sorts that he does, where he thinks he can get the best service by belittling the person on the other end of the line, yelling, calling them stupid, and asking to speak to a manager. Its gotten to the point where I know what he's going to say next.


Sis: 

Sis is doing okay, now. And I say that cuz I have faith in her. She always had issues growing up- she was apparently raped (forgive me- I say 'apparently' because she had lied about a lot before but I will get to that part soon!), came out as bi as a teen, then came out as Lesbian. She did a lot of drugs, but not anymore. I really don't think she was ever addicted- I think she just experimented. She always did great in school, then went to a good college, graduated almost top of her class, and is now working as a waitress in a nice little hip city, in a cute apartment, trying to find real work. She says that she's happy doing what she's doing and may not try to find a real job anytime soon. This concerns my mom, and not so much my dad (that's typical). But I do feel she's doing great, and she'll get a real job when she's ready. She's smart and not lazy.


My sis first went to a psych ward when she was 16. I was in college and no one told me. She threatened to kill herself. Did the same thing a year later. She finally told my parents that she was raped, and my mom said it was her fault(my mom said it was my MOM's fault). She was diagnosed with depression, and was on meds at 17. She still did drugs, despite being on anti depressives. She snuck out a lot, lief about a lot, and stole sometimes. Then, when she was in college, she self diagnosed herself as manic depressive. Recently, her college psych properly diagnosed her with Bi Polar disorder. I don't see it- but I feel that a psych of course knows more than I do. My sis is hoping to get mood stabilizers soon.


Growing up, she was always very combative and would threaten to kill herself if my mom didn't let her hang out with her friends, or buy her something. I always felt that she did this because she knew how to take advantage of our vulnerable mother- who was so afraid of my sis killing herself that she would give in and give her whatever she wanted. (An ipod, new clothes, a haircut).


My sis and I barely speak, but I think that's both of our faults. I hated her when I was growing up for how she caused so much drama in the house, and I refused to speak to her. So I think she just got used to it, and that became ""our way"" of being with each other. It's getting better now- I'm not as immature, and I feel she's becoming...healthier. I really do have faith that we can have a healthy future together. Her and I even get together sometimes to talk about our parents and try to figure it out together. I really appreciate when we can do that- it makes me feel like we're figuring out the puzzle of our childhood, which is not something we can do alone. I still think I have to give her more time though, because she still needs to get a handle on her emotions. She still can go from 0-100 very quickly, just like my dad. But I have faith that that'll change because I know I was still like that when I was 22 as well.




Me:

Sometimes I think I'm doing great in life, other times I think I'm a loser as well. I have never had a family that supports me and what I do. They are willing to let me fall back on them if needed (which I have never, so far) but they will never tell me what I'm doing is good. 


Basically, I grew up REALLY angry, yet walked on eggshells around everyone at home. I've never been able to talk to my parents about any emotional stuff, because they can't handle it. Mom either freaks out, or dad yells. I couldn't go for advice on boys or anything. I always felt guilty for anything- bad tests, grades, saying something that would make mom go lay in bed all day, being alive, anything. Then, I wanted to travel and see the world. I wanted to go after high school, before college. Mom talked me out of it, saying it was dangerous and I'd get killed. I graduated college, and went anyway (Still, the only thing I regret in life is NOT travelling right after highschool. I would have had a different life route.) I'm not going to get into how miserable and unsupportive my family was of me travelling after college- but basically I was talking to a guy online (dangerous, yes.) who lived in another country. He helped me get a job, apply for a visa, and I went. Him and I ended up dating for almost three years, and he was a blessing. I kept travelling with him and he helped me grow up and learn that the whole world isn't trying to rape and kill me.

Him and I broke up because I grew up so much, that I learned who I was, and that I wanted to get another degree, and eventually settle down. He didn't want that, so we ended. (still a wonderful man) I am now studying for my Masters abroad in a different country, speak two languages, and am learning a third. I think I do great with communicating with people, relationships in general, and building up my resume and networks. I feel very mature and can't wait to be done with my graduate degree and get a job somewhere, GET THERAPY, and settle down. Folks still make me question my life choices, but I just hope I'll end up okay. Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm too old to have only had ONE real job. I'm afraid that I'm running out of time. I get my masters degree in July 2017 and I'm hoping to work find a real job either before that, or immediately after. I already have an internship lined up in another country, which I go to in 2 months!


  **tl;dr**: Family members are an emotional mess. Are very depressed and have big issues (I feel). This has been making me question my sanity, and I can't handle the emotional stress. I go into detail about what they're like to maybe get advice on how I should go about everything.


Thanks everyone!"
do,"Me and my SO have been together for a few years now, and we've known each other longer then that. about a year or so back after watching a movie, she brought up the topic of being in a threesome, stating if she was okay with it would I be okay with it.

foolishly, i said yes. Honestly I could care less one way or the other but she made it seem like it was something that would turn her on, etc. Anyways, we have a fight about it, come to a conclusion, then its over. Fastforward to earlier this year, and after another movie she brings up this conversation and once again we get into the same fight.

Now she has brought it up a third time after having a dream where I cheat on her. She continuously asks why I think it's okay to touch another girl, I respond that in this hypothetical situation she would be turned on by it so why would it be a problem, to which she replies that I am dodging the question. I've continously responded and tied to talk about it with her but every response is marked as invalid for one reason or another.

So she threatens me that I better answer or else its over, I answer and she says its over.... Idk what to do, I understand it upset her, Im trying to make it right but at the same time we've had this conversation before and to top it off it's 3am and I've been working on an assingment thats due tomorrow while she's now probably comfortably asleep....

do,"I just finished my first week of teaching elementary school. I've been dreading going back to school tomorrow all weekend. The school is new, so everyone is still trying to figure things out. But because it's so hectic, I feel like I'm not getting the support that I need. I have a lot of kids that need a lot of attention and I'm just overwhelmed. I'm starting to think that maybe being a teacher is not for me. Any advice on what I should do?"
do,"I'm 24 and I have had a crush on someone for almost ten years. I met her in my freshman year of High School. The minute that she sat down next to me, I felt butterflies. I couldn't talk, I started shaking, and I was paying WAY too much attention to my breathing. She was and is the most beautiful girl/woman I have ever seen. She had it all, her personality was unmatched and everyone loved her. Confidence, charisma, charm, intelligence, I can go on for days. I however was not well liked. I was new in the school and immediately and repeatedly embarrassed myself. I was the most awkward guy ever. I had acne, I made crappy jokes, a was arrogant at times and acted like I was better and smarter than everyone, and as a result I got picked on. There was one guy who asked this girl out and she declined(she got asked out a lot and never said yes) and I was talking about him bullying me and she said she would back me up. I fell even deeper in love. I even deluded myself into thinking that she liked me. I would stalk her Facebook just to look at her pictures hoping that someday I could be worthy of her. It turned into a weird obsession, actually. The thing is, I still do it. I'm really afraid of her in person, she intimidates me and in the rare occasions that we run into each other, I get nervous and act foolish. She is successful, has traveled the world, and everyone loves her still. Plus, she is GORGEOUS! I am unemployed, coming off of drug problems, developing alcoholism, and am known around our town as a bad guy. Plus when was a kid, I was diagnosed with mild Asperger's. Am I weird? What should I do? I know I'll never have her, and I'm not even comfortable around her. I feel like I am no good and possibly crazy."
do,"I a 30 year old male from Illinois.  So long story short, I was married to someone 15 years older than me(yes this was an awful mistake, I fully understand how dumb I was in this decision).  We got divorced 5 years ago, we accrued some debt in her name through credit cards, paying for our wedding and a few other unnecessary luxuries.  She bought a brand new Jeep Wrangler in her name about 18 months prior to us getting divorced. 

When she filed for divorce with her attorney, at the time I had just moved out on what little money I had left, needless to say I couldn't hire an attorney, nor did I understand the ramifications of not having one.  I am not making excuses for myself, just clearly stating the facts.

So I get a letter to come to the attorney's office and sign some paperwork to finalize the divorce, I read over the paperwork and it's all good except for the I'm responsible for half of a loan until it's paid in full.  It was at this moment I was informed that she had acquired a debt consolidation loan through her bank, this loan included from my knowledge the credit card we had and her Jeep Wrangler.  So I agreed to pay for my half of the debt.

Fast forward 5 years, I have made leaps and bounds in terms of maturity and life lessons.  So I decide to really sit down and look at my finances, looking over the divorce papers, I realize I've never received any information regarding this loan, the full amount, what was actually financed in the loan etc etc.  I contact my ex wife asking for some paperwork on the loan so I can see how much is left to pay and what exactly is financed(yes I'm about 5 years late on this, but I was an idiot who didn't know his asshole from a hole in the ground).  She sends me a slip of paper stating that the loan had been refinanced in 2014 with an end date of 2019, for an amount that seemed fairly excessive for having been paid on for 5 years.

My question is how long can she keep refinancing this loan and trying to leave me on the hook?  It seems she took me for all I was worth because I wasn't financially stable and did not take the time to have the knowledge in regards to getting divorced.  Can I dispute this debt, especially since it's been refinanced.  I should be able to request information regarding what is actually being financed in this loan to make sure she's not just adding in her own personal debt to this right?  It seems she scammed me pretty good, but from my view from here it seems she could have me on the hook for the rest of my life if she just keeps refinancing said loan."

1. I can't hit most targets with widowmaker if they're moving no matter how perfect my shot is. 

2. Genji shurikens don't land consistently at all for moving target even when I watch them go through the enemy player model.

I can make more proof later if you guys still think I'm crazy. I would also like to say that I take pride in have better aim (on console) than most so it's very rage inducing to hit my shots but still miss. 

I ran the Internet test on my Xbox and my results were 16.46 Mbps download and 1.70 Mbps upload with 0% packet loss and 47ms latency on an open NAT type and wired connection. Also it says MTU is 1480 but idk what that is honestly. I don't doubt it could be my internet but it's not all that bad. Anything I can do?

do,"It's been pretty cold where I live (relatively speaking...for a cat) for the past few weeks, so I decided to get my 2 male cats some heated cat beds they can lounge in individually. Went to Amazon and got a couple that are high quality. 

I plugged in one of them to start, and my orange tabby immediately claimed it as his. Great. Set up the other bed, and my grey tabby (who was acting a bit skittish) didn't want much to do with it. In order to attract him, I sprayed a bit of catnip spray in the bed and placed him near it. He seemed happy and was rubbing his face all over the bed, rolling around inside and generally in a euphoric state. Then I saw him assume the position and squat, and before I could get him out of the bed he peed on it.

""This is why we can't have nice things..."" I started, and got him out while he concluded his pee fountain all over the floor. 

As I laundered the second cat bed, I found him sitting in the first bed with no apparent pee in it. Then a bit later found both cats sharing the first bed, which is something they normally don't do (they just like their space and don't cuddle up frequently...no reason to force these things.)

Thinking this was an issue with unfamiliar scents, I placed a t-shirt of mine in the now-clean second cat bed. Came out of my room later and my t-shirt is soaked with cat pee in addition to the cat bed. I've since decided to throw the bed (and t-shirt) away as I need to move on with my life and can't spend all of my time in the laundry room trying to get the damn thing clean, but WHY does this happen? 

Here are some more details about the situation:

* Both male cats are 6 y/o and neutered.

* They both had a stint with dental disease a few months ago and had to get some teeth removed, and it's now clear they both had stomatitis (which can affect the GI tract as well, according to my vet) from a young age. They were not able to tolerate any food except for a very specific prescription (Hills I/D) wet food for years and I did not brush their teeth, as I've never had a cat that needed it before (grew up with cats). I felt horrible for not recognizing the stomatitis and dental disease symptoms but since the removal surgery they are both doing much better and inhale dry food at an exponentially increasing rate. They get plenty of water every day and appear to greatly enjoy their water fountain. 

* Both cats were checked out before their surgery and given a clean bill of health outside of their dental issues.

* Problem Cat does not pee on the hardwood floor, leather couch or anywhere else in the apartment that I can tell.  

* This is not the first time he's peed on a soft object placed on the floor or at a low elevation. Once he peed on some jeans left out at my apartment (long story...) and another time several months ago he peed on a self heating cat bed that used heat reflective material to warm the cat. I chalked this incident up to the litter box not being cleaned, but now I'm not so sure.

* The first time the cat peed on the bed, it was immediately after the litter had been freshly changed. The second time he peed on the bed it was a day after the bed was deployed.

* They share a litterbox. I have a small-ish apartment in a major city so having litterboxes all over the place is not a solution nor is letting them outside.

* I have recently changed their litter to a pine-based pellet type litter, and they don't appear to be having problems with it. The change was 3 weeks ago and no pee incidents occurred in the interim period before I deployed the cat bed.

* Neither cat is allowed in my bedroom and it has been this way since I adopted them. Now I actually feel much better about this as I think my bed would have gotten peed on multiple times per day over the course of 6 years given the jean and cat bed incidents.

Outside of this smelly quirk, Problem Cat (the grey tabby) is normal and affectionate, though he has always been very needy. Even after peeing in the cat bed the second time, he was affectionate toward me, but naturally there was some lag time between his peeing and me finding out about it. 

Why does this happen? Is there any way to fix it and why would he only pick the second cat bed? I've searched this subreddit for similar issues and things do appear to crop up for other readers, but it seems very specific in nature."

do,"I was on Adderall (~20-30mg) for 2 years. I always had bad work ethic/habits/laziness but I probably didn't really need Adderall. I took a half-day neuropsych evaluation a few months ago and it concluded that I don't have attention lapses and that I don't meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. 

That same evaluation had me self-report severe depression (not suicidal; just no interest/hope/etc). I was also prescribed an SSRI for a year but it didn't do any effects so I discontinued that too. 

Anyway, I didn't like how it made me an emotionless robot who either 1) spent the entire day on it locked in a room, alone, slaving away at work; or 2) too tired to do anything but lie in bed.

So I took my last dose about 2 months ago. The first month off, I was on vacation so I couldn't do anything but lie in bed &amp; watch TV. In June, I started a summer internship. But when I come home from the internship, I'm back to lying in bed &amp; watching youtube mindlessly. 

I thought Adderall withdrawal would just have me nap &amp; sleep all the time. But when I wake up, I have no problem staying awake the entire day without coffee or anything. I just have literally no desire to do anything unless I HAVE to (e.g., groceries, work assignment due in a few days). 

I used to feel bed about being secluded all the time but now, 2 months off Adderall, I still don't have any interest in going out &amp; being around other people.  

Is this still Adderall withdrawal? If so, how much longer will it go?"

And the further you played, the bigger the difficulty of the levels. Also goes without saying the ""map"" of every level was different, it even had a Christmas themed one.

I'm from Tucson and lived in the south side so the repetitive critiques of Fresno's crime and ""shitty-ness"" don't scare me away; really this city seems extremely similar but slightly better than the Dirty T. I've been living in Atlanta for the past 5 months and hate it, it's massive but so isolating and people overall just are so closed off, I don't have any friends outside of acquaintances at work, and it's wayyy too expensive with low wages. Tucson has tons of problems but we have that ""small city identity"" and some sense of community and Fresno just seems to have that kinda vibe from what I read. I'm 22, work in call centers or other csr jobs and am a musician, enjoy more low-key bars and social events, really just love a more relaxed version of city life. Anyone know Tucson and Fresno even slightly, just enough to confirm my feeling that they're similar enough i'd love it here? Really want just anything you can tell me about the place as well, I want out of Atl so bad and this is my #1 choice but have never been so would love to hear from locals what Fresno is like.

do,"Now don't get me wrong, I understand why it's in place, I have no qualms with it, BUT what happened to the revenue earned by (and from) small YT creators when this rule was put in place?

I earned a small amount of ad revenue from my videos before the 10k lifetime views rule was put in place, obviously youtube also earned revenue from those videos. When the rule was put into effect, there was no trace of that ad revenue that I had already earned, like nothing.

I emailed them (while I still could via the ""help"" option on the app) and I just got responses trying to tell me about the 10k lifetime views rule. They didn't even properly read my emails at all. I'm not asking them to reinstate my channel to be able to monetize my videos, I'm asking what happened to the ad revenue I had already earned. 

So no proper response, but then suddenly I could monetize my content again and I got my previously earned ad revenue back. So I dropped it. 

Now recently there was a notification that it showed that some people under 10k lifetime views could monetize their content and this was a bug that has now been fixed. 

I'm fine with that, but just for in case, I checked if I still had my previously earned ad revenue. Low and behold it's gone.. Now I can't email them again because of that same rule. 

So I resorted to the ""send feedback"" option and tried again. I'm expecting similar results as before.

But I'm curious now, how many other small creators has this happened to? Because however small the amount earned, youtube also has their own cut and I can't be the only one this has happened to right? Depending on the amount of users that have gone through similar situations, youtube has probably gained a nice little kickback from this rule, right?

Anyone else this has happened to?"

Calls are quicker.  My life would be easier if making calls don't debilitate me. Do you guys have any tips on how to calm down before calling strangers? A lot of them? Thanks.

PS. I am not a telemarketer, just a person with a secretarial job."
do,"Hi there!

We have an [indoor female cat](http://imgur.com/RmKNvUE), 7 years old, and sometimes, when she's in the litter box, she's meowing. I asked the vet and she said that as long as she's not spending too much time in there (but what is too much time for a cat??) and as long as she both pees and poops, then it should be okay. Her poop is always firm - I don't know if it can be too hard or what we should do to make it softer in that case? She drinks a lot of water, eats dry food and once per week she gets wet food.

Any inputs? 

Edit: Now, one week later, we have changed the litter box to an open one and talked to the vet about it. I also managed to record it one time (pretty weird to film a cat pooping...). She thought we should give her 1 ml of Lactulose (I have no idea if you have that in the states or anywhere else, but basically it's a mild laxative also given to babies and such) every morning and evening. We haven't caught her meowing in the litter box, but we have been at the beach and such and therefore haven't been much home. The vet said that if it helped, it could be an idea to give her dry food specifically for sensitive stomachs otherwise we should bring her in for a check. So we'll see how the next couple of weeks will go."

do,"I'm 14 years old, female and from the uk. I really struggle with feeling like my problems are insignificant because honestly compared to others they really are. My parents are together we don't have a huge amount of money but we have enough. This is all great but there is some stuff that really gets to me. I don't have a great relationship with my parents it isn't really bad but we fall out A LOT. I have been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, I react really badly to neagtivity from people expecially my parents. They can ask me seriously to do something or get slightly annoyed about something and I will immediatly get really upset and I just loose all control and start yelling I want to stop it but I can't emotion just takes over. It terrifies me that I have so little control in this state. My parents will yell back and neadless to say it has taken a toll on our relationship. My mum will do things like call me abusive, threaten to send me to temporary care over the weekends and stuff she gets really stressed out by it and will just scream at me she will never apologise for anything . My dad is different he dosent get stressed but he gets angry and he will occasionally just snap yelling and swearing at me but he apologises so I find it easier to deal with. I know this is all my fault but somehow this just makes think 100 times worse because I can't blame anyone but myself. I have never had the easiest time at school I was picked on a lot in primary and never really had any friends. Secondary im still picked on but I found friends so it's easier to deal with in a way. I never really let this stuff upset me and I've always been very numb towards it. This stuff seems massive to me but I know it's probably nothing compared to most peoples problems and that just makes me feel like a shit person for feeling this way. I feel completely useless, I'm not exited for life and I, sad most if not all of the time. It gets to the point I don't even care if I live or die anymore dying just seems so much easier and better for everyone else. I don't want anyone to think I'm doing this for attention I really don't I'm just stuck and I don't know who I can ask about this. Everything I deal with is so insignificant compared to what most people have in their lives I just want to know if I really am a bad person for feeling like this."

I need to have them as hairless as possible. I'm not sure where else to go for this. The internet has so far given me very conflicting and sometimes worrying advice. 

I tried using the search function to find questions like this but I couldn't, although I'm sure they're there. 

So, how do?"

do,"Alright, so the backstory It's going to be long, but there will be a tl;dr after every section.

I've been diagnosed with severe recurrent depression attributed to both a chemical imbalance as well as environmental influence.

I'm a young adult, 28, still living at home (with my other). My parents filed for divorce when I was 18, perhaps somewhat contrary to many people in this situation, having my dad completely out of my life has been one of the better things for me. It's been a solid 20 years since I had any semblance of a reasonable relationship with him. Having him in my life, even if it was just tolerating being around him, has always been a struggle. He was never physically abusive, but was verbally abusive without even realising it (whis way of ""helping"" was to try and ""encourage"" you in a demeaning manner). This was exacerbated with drinking (wouldn't consider him an alcoholic).


I'm not quite sure how to phrase it, so i'll use the typical ""I struggle to hold a steady job"". It goes beyond that, however. I struggle to land a job. This will be touched on later, but I got a late start on the job search because of school. I've held what's considered a ""part time"" job for near a decade now (2009), working at a local university medical center as what's called a standardized patient. The long story short is i'm an actor portraying a (usually) scripted role and assessing the bedside manners and clinical skills of medical students (ranging from premed to residency). It's a job I love as i've always been completely fascinated with medicine, but it's nowhere even close to being a sustainable job. I may work every day one week, and then it may be two, three, or four months until i'm needed again. more on this in the next section, however. Outside of that, i've held essentially one full-time job during 2013. I began working in the warehouse of the company that my sister works for (she's a graphic designer) I held this job until I was literally physically incapable of doing so. I experienced an on-the-job injury that I never reported (I was a temp, they would have let me go, and had I fought it, it would have caused hell for my sister) that was entirely related to violation of OSHA standards. I worked through physical pain for roughly six months that genuinely made me want to collapse in a ball and cry, it's now a permanent physically limiting injury. After visiting numerous specialists, physical therapists, and musculoskeletal rehab, it's been deemed that surgery is the only option that remains; this surgery fails just as often as is succeeds, and if it fails, it's *very* likely to make the situation worse. Those are odds I can't risk. i'm at a point where having to exert or lift weight above around 30 lbs is a struggle. My left arm will often just give out under weakness. I feel this limits my job search, but everyone around me continually tells me to lie on applications and ""explain why"" should something happen should something happen at work, I refuse to do so (i'm not keen on putting myself through that kind of physical pain again, nor am I keen on lying on my application as it's grounds for immediate termination; i don't need a termination on my record, it's hard enough as it is).
At this point in my life, i'm applying for literally everything that I can come up with. I'd estimate that i've put forth a thousand applications in the last year. (surely I must be kidding, right? No.), and i've gotten a handful at best of callbacks, none of which lead anywhere.

* **tl;dr: I struggle to hold a job and I have a physically limiting injury that limits my job search**

More on school and why I love my job. Ever since I was little, i've been fascinated by medicine. I was the kid that was reading books on anatomical structures during reading time, or medical journals when we had free use of computers at school. In particular, i've always had a love for veterinary science. Ever since I can remember, i've wanted to be a vet, it seems like a natural fit; I love medicine, and I love animals. This is why I love my job as an SP, i'm still involved in medicine; I know the intricate details beyond how you (the student) arrive at your differential diagnoses of every case i've ever portrayed. I go home, I research them, and i'm fascinated by it. The team that I work under (some MD, some PHD, RN, LVN, PA, and some with ""only"" an MSEd, basically the instructors) love me because of my dedication, and use me whenever they can. At this point, I think every single one of them have tried to help me land a permanent position at the institution. I say this not to boast about myself, but to say that I realize that my life isn't all dead flowers and rotten tomatoes.
As I said previously, I got a late start on the working portion of my adult life. I can attribute this to school. I can confidently say that I stopped learning in a school setting in about the fourth grade. Most everything I know is because it's either intrinsic to me, or i've sought out the information on my own terms. I slogged through to my high school days, confidently saying it was a waste of my time. I ""dropped out"" of traditional high school and enrolled in a type of homeschooling called independent study. I met with a teacher once a week, but other than that, I was free to teach myself. I learned FAR more efficiently this way than had I stuck to traditional 8-3pm school schedule. I graduated, and pushed myself to to college. It was a 2.0 of primary education. a waste of my time. I'm no learning anything, and i'm struggling to focus on the matters that are unimportant to me. I have ultimately dropped out of college three times now. had I pursued a degree and focused on a discipline, I have enough credits under my belt to technically qualify to petition for graduation with a Masters, but I don't even have so much as an associates to show for it.
By no means to I consider myself a stupid person. In fact, my reading level is in the top 1% in the nation, my reading comprehension is in the top 2% (broad reading ability is in the top 1.5%), my writing skills are in the top 2%, my verbal and written vocabulary are in the top 4%, ETC. I know these numbers as I put myself through multiple different learning disability evaluations, and the results were repeatable. Where I struggle most with is in math on the broad spectrum, my math skills are ""normal"" for where I should be, I score within the top 51%. There is an abnormally large deficit between all my other academic skills and my math that I do qualify for a form of learning disability assistance, and it's going to sound like i'm boasting here, but it's referred to as Gifted disabled. What this essentially boils down to is that my brain does not understand why I don't do as well in math as I do in all other aspects of a ""well rounded student"", essentially it implodes on itself when I have to try and assess math. This has held me back in a school setting as my math grades slip drastically if I don't dedicate nearly all of my time to math,  but when I do so, all my other grades slip because of my lack of motivation and interest in learning in a school setting.

* **tl;dr: I love medicine, I would love to be a vet some day, but don't see it being attainable because of the math involved and the education taking place in a school setting. I struggle with school, particularly math, but repeatedly place phenomenally well in all other aspects.**

When it comes to technology, it's always been a hobby of mine. I built my first computer when I was 12, and I taught myself the basics of Java, HTML, and C+ over time. I've taken classes for a degree in I.T., Computer Information Technologies, and Computer Information Systems (tiree different degrees from three different schools I attended, but did not complete) I'm MCITP and Cisco certified, but I know, without a doubt, that it's not a job that I want to do. I can't sit behind a desk and work day in and day out at a desk job for the rest of my life, I would genuinely hate my life. But, it's something that I do well.

Another lifelong dream of mine has been to follow in my grandfather's footsteps. He enlisted in the USMC to do his part in the second world war. He's someone that i've looked to as a father figure for most of my life (see above for my relationship with my dad). On my 18'th birthday, I contacted a recruiter, set up a meeting, and met with him. The meeting took all of about six minutes wherein I found out I was disqualified from enlisting as my path through high school was nontraditional. Independent study disqualified me from service. Upon seeking help for depression, I sealed the casket with a nail, some super glue, around the seems, put the casket inside a steel box, welded that box shut, then shot that box into deep space on a rocket designed to detonate with a kiloton nuclear warhead on an unknown trajectory.

I'm an avid supporter of the second amendment. I've been around firearms all my life, and i'm an amateur gunsmith. Becoming an accredited gunsmith would be an in-and-out process for me, but unfortunately, there's very little room for growth or opportunity in gunsmithing. Every professional gunsmith i've ever talked to have said that because there's little room for growth, gunsmithing is a side job, a hobby, as they couldn't support themselves on what they earn. Keep in mind here that gunsmithing and engineering are two very different things with very similar outer appearances.

* **tl;dr: the things I do well, i'd hate to do as a job, i've been disqualified from, or don't provide a sustainable future.**

These are the persistent environmental factors that play into my depression. Obviously there have been other nonpersistent factors.

Now, here comes the short part:

I sought help for depression in 2012. I was diagnosed with severe recurrent depression and tried a number of antidepressants until settling on Paxil. I started on a 10MG dose, upped to 20, then 40, and finally settled on 50. it helped a little with management of my day to day life, but something never felt quite right.
In late 2015/early 2016, I was unknowingly removed from my medical insurance plan. My father was the primary on the account, and the notification was sent to him that I was removed. He either didn't receive it, removed me without telling me, or didn't care enough to contact me about the issue; I don't rightly care any way you look at it. 

When I went to make an appointment to refill my paxil, I was notified that I was no longer covered, and as a result, wasn't actually able to see my psychiatrist. I had a week prescription of paxil left that I stretched out to two weeks (half doses) it took nearly a month to resolve the issue and find coverage again. For two weeks I experienced withdrawals, and if you asked me during them, I would have thought I was dying. Cold sweats, twitching, irritability, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision, the whole nine yards, along with what the worst part of it, a phenomenon I still can't explain to people. It feels like electrical shots running through my brain, particularly when my eyes change focus or focal planes. It's almost as though I can feel my brain focusing, and hear a static noise in my inner ear as my eyes move.

In the time that my paxil ran out, and my withdrawals started, however, I realized that I felt better in nearly every single way than when I was on paxil. I had motivation to do things, I felt better just in general, and people noticed that I was just a different person as a whole.

Since being covered under insurance, i've since decided that I wanted to stop taking paxil. I talked to my psychiatrist about it, and he was very unsupportive in the decision, strongly encouraging me to remain on paxil. so, i've take it upon myself to wean myself off of it. It's been a process that's been ongoing for roughly five months, far longer than any literature on the subject outlined. I've been reducing by half doses. The pills are 20mg, i'm on 50mg, meaning two and a half tablets every day. I don't know the exact time frame by day when I reduced doses, but it's gone form 50 (2-1/2), 40 (2), 30 (1-1/2), 20 (1) 10(1/2) daily, I then switched to 10mg every other day, then once every three days. I've been on once every three days for about three weeks, and completely stopped taking them about a week ago. while down to once every other day and once/3 days, I began to notice all the withdrawal symptoms coming back, but they were mild. I was by no means feeling fantastic, but I could manage day-to-day. Since completely stopping, the withdrawal symptoms have come back en force, it feels identical to when I went cold turkey.

It's obvious that my body as developed a dependency on paxil, but i'm determined to break myself of it. I want to feel better, I want to be in a better place, I want to be in the place where paxil should help me get, but is so very apparently holding me back from. Starting paxil absolutely destroyed my metabolism as well, Prior to starting it, I was on roughly a 4k calorie diet just to maintain my weight, I was active. Since going on it, i've cut that down to less than half and i'm still gaining weight. I've gone from 181 to about 220 at my current weight. those numbers include muscle mass loss and fat gain. My activity has dropped; I don't work out anymore, I don't run, I don't exercise in general because i've lost the desire to do so.

So my questions come in here:

1. For withdrawals, how do you manage them? what are some coping mechanisms that you believe may help? I""m not expecting a one-stop fix, but as i'm sitting here typing this, i'm having those ""electrical"" feelings in my brain. Yesterday, I had a fight with my mother (I don't even remember what about, something stupid), and after, for several hours, my irritability wanted me to punch a hole through the wall. I don't want people to talk to me. I don't even want them to look at me because I know it's going to irritate me. I've got the chills, full-on shivering chills, but i'm sweating. I'm struggling to focus both literally, and figuratively. My eyes are struggling to focus on one point, and i'm struggling to keep focused on the things I need to do. I'm sick to my stomach, can't keep foods down, and have absolutely zero appetite. My head is pounding, and my arms and legs are a twitching mess. I'm basically a nonfunctioning existence right now, but I have obligations that I have to meet.

2. If anyone has experienced withdrawals from SSRIs, how long did it take for you to get over them? Everything i've read has said it's anywhere from a couple days to several months, but that things should slowly and progressively improve. None of these were accounts of people who went through them personally. In the two weeks previously where I was forced to go cold turkey, my symptoms didn't seem to improve in the slightest. If this is going to be a months-on-end type deal, even after a slow degression  i'm not entirely sure how i'm going to function in the slightest.

I apologize for the wall of text, but I had to put something out there, I couldn't  keep to myself, and sometimes the anonymity of the internet can actually be a positive thing. I can release myself to people i'll likely never meet and seek help from them in ways i've not been able to find.

do,"For a bit of background, all three of us have been friends since kindergarten, and we always hang out and go to concerts together. This is also being posted on a throwaway account because they are redditors.  



About a month ago me and my two friends talked about how we should go to a lot of concerts this summer. I immediately told them that one of my favorite bands, The Melvins, were having a concert on April 12th. We agreed that we should all go together and that it would be fun.



Fast forward about a week, I ask them again if they want to go because we need to buy the tickets for the train and for the concert. Both of them say that they can't go because they cannot miss their classes for that day, so we all agree that we can't go (I did not want to go by myself and no one else I know likes the Melvins). I was pretty bummed about it. 



Present day, I find out that they both went to the concert last night with their boss and some of their coworkers and didn't even mention it to me at all. They knew that I was able to go and I was the one that told them about the concert in the first place. I've never been so pissed about something in my life. 



Am I overreacting? Is there anything I should do about this? I sent 
them both texts and they gave me dumb excuses that they didn't invite me because they were invited by their boss and coworkers to go with them. Part of me wants to stop hanging around them altogether, but they are my really good friends and It would be hard to avoid them because we are all a part of the same friend group. I feel like this isn't something I should just ignore. If they were really my friends, then they would not have done this to me. Has anyone been in a similar situation?



TL;DR: I told my friends about a concert, they said they could not go because they had class that day. Fast forward a month later, they both go with their boss and coworkers and say nothing to me about it, even though they knew I wanted to go."

do,"Hey everyone, long time lurker and this is my first post here. 

So I scheduled a doctors appointment with a specialist that my brother sees and recommended to me. I am covered under my mother's plan and so is my brother. I was just told that I need to pay a $200 deductible for the visit and the insurance will cover the next visits, I just need to cover the co-pay. The appointment costs $275, so the receptionist just told me I need to pay my $200 deductible and the insurance will cover the rest. This is all just so confusing because my brother has never had to pay more than the co-pay with this doctor and neither has anyone else in my family when going to see a doctor or specialist. My appointment is tomorrow and I really want to sort things out as soon as possible, because I feel they might be making an error with this whole ordeal.

However, I'm really interested in digging deep into all the different characters in this game and finding one that I really love, because I know that this game is supposed to be a lot more balanced throughout the roster than Melee. However, it's just so intimidating looking at all of those characters and trying to figure  out the intricacies of how each of them work.

do,"I'm a 21 year old female, and my boyfriend is also 21. As the title suggests, we've been together for 6 years. And for the past 3 have been having a lot of problems. We've been trying to work it out, but I don't know if I want to continue. 

I have autism, and as a result, am prone to get angry or frustrated very easily. I also have a hard time communicating, but I've been working on that for a while. I know I'm a big part of the problem, but I am getting better. 

Ever since our problems have started, my boyfriend has blamed them all on me. I can count on one hand the amount of times he has admitted to causing a problem, and I'll admit, those few times he has apologized. But this has been only a few fights out of hundreds. 

One of my main problems with him are that he won't admit when he's started a fight. He says something rude or dismissive to me and refuses to apologize. He gets more and more frustrated and angry with me until he just gives up and says he wants to shoot himself... 

That's another more recent problem. He's says these things about killing himself to me all the time. His arms are covered with knife marks and I know for a fact that he drinks to make himself feel better. He says all the time that he's going to get help, but he just never does. It's gotten to the point where I'm afraid he's going to kill himself any day. I won't talk to him anymore because I'm afraid of making it worse. 

Not that it matters, he completely avoids me. He won't answer when I call, or answer my texts. When we make plans, he cancels them the day of. I don't remember the last time I spent more than a couple minutes with him. I used to see him when I went into his work, but apparently he put his notice in (I found out from my mother. He still talks to her apparently). So now I won't be seeing him there anymore. 

I try my best to make this work. I know he's tried his hardest in the past too. But, he's given up. And for the most part, so have I. I don't want a relationship this long to end, but I don't know how much more of this I can take. I have major depression too. I'm trying to be understanding of his position, but it's just so exhausting for me too. Every time I think he can't make it worse, he comes out with some more shit about his past. Apparently he's trans now... I don't know...

Should I just break it off with him? Or should I keep trying? I'm sorry if this post didn't make much sense. I'm really upset right now...

do,"So i went to my psychiatrist today telling her that i stopped taking my medication for my depression/anxiety/ and off-label ADD. It was not doing me any good, physically or mentally. I was getting back pain, my thinking process slowed down, I couldn't quiet my mind from my negative thoughts, I slurred my words when I spoke and responded to someone slower when I was talking to them; getting stuck a lot when trying to explain something to someone or when trying to understand a new concept, and my anxiety worsened a bit as well. Basically, It didn't help with all of the problems I had to face. Anyways, so i only told her about the back pain and my slowed down thinking process and the slurring. So now she is suggesting a brain scan for my possible ADD. I just wish my insurance would cover it but it doesn't so I have to pay $150 with no current job at the moment. The only downside I can see from this is that the results come out negative. I would be pretty disappointed mainly because I wouldn't know what the hell was wrong with me. I've done some research about ADD/ADHD and a lot of it did seem to fit, but it could also be depression according to my psychologist since they both have similar things in common. I know for a fact my mom has ADD from what she has told me when she was younger so that's possibly the reason that I might have it. I just don't want to waste money on something that I might not have. I'm just hoping it comes out positive because work and school have been a complete pain when I have no idea what's going on.

Normally, I wouldn't really care (I rarely celebrate my birthday at home), but my parents keep nagging me to do something fun. Also, considering how awful this summer has been, I kind-of want to do something different as well. 

I've already made plans with friends for the weekend, but no one is free tomorrow. As a result, I'm celebrating it by myself! I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions of what I could do that would be loads of fun and relatively inexpensive. 

Oh, and if it makes a difference, I'm turning 20, so bars are pretty much out of the question. 

Thanks so much! Have a nice night! =D"
do,"So, this is going to seem somewhat like the stereotypical situation but with a bit more of a ""screw you, let's make this harder for you (not like that).""

So, there's this girl I really like. She's really funny and fun to be around and I love talking to her. I love her sense of style and she's one of those girls where you think about them and it just makes you smile and you don't quite know why. And when I found out she was also bi (and also mostly into girls), I was very happy. We've been very flirty with each other for a little while now but not quite sure if that means something since we both can get kinda flirty with friends. Although there was one time where I took her ice skating and it ended up kind of being a date and kind of not (which we both admitted. She actually mentioned it first). 

One of the problems is that she's a good friend of mine and I don't necessarily have all that many friends, so I get a bit worried about that. But on top of that, I have pretty bad social anxiety. So basically this ends up with me over-analyzing everything and thinking of every possible scenario, specifically the bad ones mixed with subconsciously telling myself things that lower my self esteem and confidence because I feel like ""knowing me, she's gonna hate you and all that shiz."" Obviously, this makes it a lot harder to figure out what to do/how to do it. 

So, the big thing here is that I really like her and want to ask her out properly or make some sort of move, but make it enough to where she gets the memo and can react accordingly without spiking my anxiety too much so I don't get an anxiety attack or something of the sort. Also, just some tips in general would be nice. I'm not into this scene all that much so if anyone knows something that works well, it'd be appreciated. 

So yeah, in short, help plz. XD"

do,"So basically i borrowed this godsword from a clannie, and i wanted to return it to him. However, i changed it to passive mode and needed some clan members to join me at gwd to pray at altar. First time i went with a clannie, the clan member didn't know the way, and my familiar was dying. In the end we got there but i got killed by the followers because i didn't have sara equipped. 2nd time, i wanted to go, the other clannies promised to go with me. This clan member said lets go... Then turns out he wants to keep working on the beach. Then i try to go myself n i reach gwd. That member still takes a long time and refused to go. Other clannie says...take ur time. We can go first. I was so angry. I died killing the sara followers.
Point is, this clannie has become very cold and unresponsive towards me after asking me to leave our old clan together. He doesn't even do the quest where u can tele someone to gwd. I wanted to walk with him to gwd but he was taking a freaking long time. And he is being unhelpful. I feel angry, i feel that i should have stayed in the old clan. And now the godsword clannie isn't accepting my discord messages for some reason. I was so angry that i left the clan. I died a few times trying to get kill count and unhelpful clannie just acts like that. I know they are not obliged to help me, but i gave him a lot of free stuff in exchange for help in the past. And i have been quite nice to him.what did i do to deserve it? I even gave him monkey barrels recently.
Tl;dr: ex clannie who used to be helpful, whom i tried to help as well, becomes cold n unresponsive. Did gwd kc alone, kept dying."

do,"Alright, it is written. I am about to hit post. I am fighting the urge to delete it all. I am sorry this is so long. I just, I don't know what to do anymore. I'm scared.

I am at the end of the road, I don’t know what else to do.

I was first diagnosed with ADHD in fourth grade and put on ritalin. It interfered with my sleep and appetite. My mother didn’t really believe in ADHD, despite what my teachers and doctors said, I was just being a boy. She used the side-effects as an excuse to take me off the meds. 

It wasn’t until my first job that I thought about ADHD again. Due to difficulties at work, and since I was on my own insurance, I went and got psychological examination. I was diagnosed with ADHD again. Not surprising. I am also dyslexic, have an IQ in the 130’s and have several Autistic family members, all of which are correlated with ADHD. I was also diagnosed with depression, another thing my family doesn’t believe in, I regularly have suicidal thoughts, dating back to third grade, especially when under stress. 

I was put on Adderall, it was a miracle drug. I could focus on what I pleased. It also shut out all the other stuff. Not only could I go for a run, but I could go for a run without making a list of all the things I needed to do and then beating myself up about them. Living in the moment, was new to me, my life and mood was on a drastic upswing. 

Four years later, I don’t know what to do. I started working on an engineering degree, just at the community college, taking night classes so I can keep my current job. I enjoyed the rigor and challenge of the work. Last semester, I had to drop out. 

The meds no longer work like they used to. We have slowly increased the doses, I’ve been on Adderall, Adderall XR and Vyvanse. I will openly admit, when first put on the medication, I took more than my dose. I did so in order to achieve that euphoric state. However, as we had to increase my dose, I stopped this behavior, I didn’t want to lose what the pills did for me. 

Still, my tolerance adjusted. Currently, I am prescribed 60mg of Vyvanse and 5mg of Adderall. For depression, I am on 300mg of  Effexor and Deplin.

My partner hides the medication from me. I get my exact dose each morning and that is it. For the first few hours, I feel like me. Well, the me I have gotten to know. However, by hour four, I start to drag. As the pill releases I get a bit of myself back, at about six hours. But that is short lived. 

I have an excellent relationship with my doctor, I absolutely do not lie or attempt to deceive her. She is aware of my poor behavior when I started on the medication and aware that my partner is now in control of it. We have toyed with the dosage in the past two months, but nothing has really helped.

I started also seeing a psychologist, he has no new solutions. I see two counselors and have googled my heart out, but don’t know what to do. 

It looks like, the medications affect will slowly diminish, and I will go back to being that person I used to be. Instead of getting up to cook dinner, I will sit and think, “what is the point, there are seven billion people on this planet, none of us matter.” Instead of writing this, I will think, “No one will read it anyways, just like that poem in seventh grade when….”.

What scares me the most -- I am not sure I can back. Life was such a struggle, I didn’t even understand. My ADHD directly contributes to my depression. I have all of these things I want to do, things I know I am capable of doing, but I usually don’t even attempt them. And if I do, I give up halfway through. 

Part of me wishes I never had this. Because, I will forever mourn the person I could have been. The accomplishments and contributions I could have made. I have desperately looked for solutions, but as far as I can tell, the gig is up. 

I have no desire to start meditating, then hopefully I can be 10% of the person I was on medication. I have no desire to spend the next ten years attempting to force myself to be someone that is so entirely foreign to the non-medicated me.

Living life the way I used to be is fine during the evenings, or on a Saturday shopping trip. Living life that way permanently? That is unacceptable. I am tired of fighting through days. I am tired of constantly working on not thinking about that and push towards this. I just want to live through my damn days. I just want to live, and not focus on surviving. 

Over the next year, or so, it looks like I will slowly lose more and more of the person I have grown to know. He is a much nicer person, that person rarely thinks about how worthless their life is. 

Yet, as I become the old me, I will continue to evaluate life. My fear is, it seems increasingly likely, that the least painful option will be to opt out, to carry out one of those life ending plans. 

This is so much longer than it was suppose to be. I guess it is nice to say this stuff out loud. It isn’t supposed to just be bitching. I should go back and proofread, especially since I am dyslexic, but I rather spend what precious time I have left on this pill, doing something I (well the me I know now) enjoy. 

Does anyone have any advice? I am willing to try anything, I am just at such a lose right now. And, to be honest, I am scared."
do,"Warning: might trigger anyone who's really anal about hygiene.

Sometimes I won't brush my teeth one night, I'll just floss and use mouthwash. Worse than that, I can't motivate myself to shower often. Sometimes as infrequent as once a week(I know, it's gross). Probably really bothers at least some people reading this, since I know it's not uncommon for some aspies to be extra attentive to hygiene.

I guess there's a couple reasons I know of as to why I don't shower as frequent as I used to or probably should. One being I don't really like seeing my body for very long. By that I mean seeing all of my body, naked. I'm not 'fat', I'm not 'inadequate', yet, I'll still find fault if I look, and I'll usually end up feeling worse afterwards cause of it. Second, I don't really feel like I'm trying to impress anyone. Though I realize this is ironic since I constantly complain, at least mostly to myself, that I have no friends, which I don't. Though before anyone says it I know it's not for that reason. Also no one that I do talk to has said a word about it, not even my family who I know would tell me. Third, I for some reason just feel more myself when I don't. I feel different after showering, and typically not in a good way. I just feel more comfortable not doing it.

So anyway, strange post, but I just wanted to write it and see what everyone thought."

do,"I'm a rising junior in college. In March I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I was put on Zoloft. At first, it made me feel great, but then it made me feel lower than ever. I stopped taking it and stopped seeing my psych, and then within a few weeks I felt great again (back to normal). I felt great until recently. I've had a relatively decent time thus far in college, however, I've taken 2 semesters where I commuted both spring semesters of fall and   year) due to extreme home issues. I have a few close friends and I also know a lot of people (it's a very large school). I'm living in my college town for the summer because it's closer to my original hometown and there are more summer jobs. Even though I feel like I have a decent amount of friends, I feel like I have nobody at the same time. It's like everyone has somebody they would chose over me. Everybody. Even my family. My close friends have their significant other, my best friends have better best friends, and I'm nobody's first choice. And it hurts. It's like I can actually feel physical pain because it hurts so much. And I don't know why I'm nobody's first choice. I would do anything for my friends and often times I'll do extra things (I live an hour away from my hometown friends) such as drive up there and then pretend like I'm there on coincidence just to see if they'll want to hangout, but often times nobody will even answer and then I'll drive home miserable. I don't let on to people on how I feel because I hate being ""that"" person. I also think about this a lot (usually when I'm alone and after I tried making plans only to find out everyone's hanging out but obviously don't want to hang with me or are too involved in what they're doing.

do,"Recently, I've been reading the DOJ report on Ferguson, and other things about the authorities there and in surrounding areas. I was shocked and horrified by what can be described without hyperbole as an extortion racket. I'm amazed at how little known this seems to be. The Ferguson protests are portrayed, at best, simply as being against a single instance of police violence and the lack of consequences, when the reality is much deeper and more systemic than that. The oppression there, if acknowledged at all, is described as ""constitutional violations"", as though the police forgot to read people their Miranda Rights, or as ""racial bias"", as if it were just a bit of unequal enforcement (that would not be acceptable, but the reality was far worse), rather than trying to ruin the lives of anyone black in order to fund themselves.

Since then, and despite this being clearly documented by the top of the Criminal Justice System and highlighted by protests across the US, it doesn't seem like much has changed, or will change. A few people have resigned, and the authorities there are trying to water down the requirements for change, so that it basically consists of a few courses which will be sat through and largely ignored, and more paperwork which will be put into a cabinet and not acted upon. The surrounding municipalities, despite seemingly employing a similar system, seem to have almost completely escaped scrutiny.

Googling, I found a few somewhat positive articles, eg. [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/town-near-ferguson-mo-agrees-to-pay-47-million-to-settle-debtors-prison-case/2016/07/14/37b42078-49db-11e6-acbc-4d4870a079da_story.html), [here](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/8/24/judge-overhauls-troubled-ferguson-missouri-court.html) and [here](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-missouri-ferguson-idUSKCN0Y01W6).

do,"Hi, all,

The ""INTJ Christians"" thread gave me the idea to post this here, and I was wondering if anyone could chime in with some advice.  I'm pretty sure I'm an INTJ, complete with all the joys and difficulties that brings.  I'm also a Christian in the C.S. Lewis/G.K. Chesterton mold, and that's the problem.  I'm having trouble reconciling several of my INTJ personality traits with being a ""good Christian"" (for non-believers, just read ""good person."")  For example:

* If I think that people need to hear something, I say it, i.e, I explained to my friend exactly what he was doing wrong in his life and why it was making him depressed, rather than offering him comfort.  I feel that I should be more kind, but I just don't think it does any good.  I wouldn't really know how in any case.
* I hate conflict between other people, but I LOVE it when it involves me.  I get such a kick out of going up against some other person, competing against the best they can do, and winning.  There's nothing quite like it.  That sort of love of battle doesn't seem very compatible with the Sermon on the Mount to me.
* I don't go out of my way to help other people.  I'm pretty generous with my friends and family, and always try to be there for them, but I just don't care about the vast majority of people.  When I was younger I volunteered at a soup kitchen with my (probably ESFJ) mother, who got so much fulfillment from helping the needy.  I didn't feel any of that, and in the case of the people who came in week after week, I thought we were doing more harm than good by perpetuating their situation.

Basically, I like being an INTJ, and I think that I have several good personality traits, but some aspects of ""me"" seem too harsh, too cold, to be compatible with Christianity.  I believe in it, though, and I want to be a good person in any case, you know?  I'd appreciate any advice."

For these past few weeks, I've been feeling pretty under the weather with general stresses in my life. I've been feeling very negative about myself aswell.
I've been having very bizarre dreams of people talking to me about things I can't understand, or atleast I don't remember any of the conversations when I wake up. Yesterday morning (April 29th) I woke up feeling non verbal and very agitated.

I only feel the slightest bit of attraction for other girls and sometimes I don't feel anything towards girls at all, right now I've lost all interest in sex and am generally experiencing a feeling of low self esteem concerning that I ever have to try again.

do,"I (M36) have learned the hard way, through a long shitty road, that communication is THE key to a relationship. I did not properly communicate my emotions to my wife (F43), a beautiful, loving, dedicated woman. Because of this, I acted out after 9 years of our relationship in ways that may not be forgiveable. If she can forgive I am not sure she can ever trust.
What I'm trying to say is if you don't let your true feelings be known, for whatever reason, you may just crack eventually and risk losing what is most important to you.
I was an upstanding human for 97% of my life. I was always faithful and dedicated to the life we are supposed to live. Even when I knew my first marriage was over I maintained my integrity. In this marriage I did too, for 8 of 9 years. Then I snapped. I tried to place some of the responsibility on her, not for the cheating, as my emotions were minimalized throughout our marriage. That, however, was my fault. I did not stand my ground. I allowed her to turn it all back on me. Now I may have lost everything.
The true love of my life has now seemingly fallen in love with another man and he is a great guy. He's not the man I can be for my family, but he's no slouch. All of this because I didn't clearly communicate where I was at and what I was feeling. I hope beyond hope that I can show her how much I love her and my children and we can be a family again. However, I won't blame her if she won't open herself to the chance she might once again feel the pain I have caused her.
I never believed emotional pain could hurt physically. It can. It feels like a flu almost. Vomiting and aching muscles. The only difference is no fever and a serious want for anything that can numb the pain. Please don't put yourself where I have.
Tl;dr: lack of communication can destroy your life"
do,"No matter what I do, it doesn't seem like it's good enough or the right thing to do. No mater what I DON'T do.. It's still wrong. I am always wrong. My grandma could get mad at me for absolutely nothing. I could just be sitting here and she could get absolutely pissed at me. I try to live my life and my fucking grandma finds some reason to take a huge shit on everything I do or say. She says I'm going out too much. So I stay home more. I invite friends over so I'm not lonely. THAT IS STILL NOT OFUCKINGKAY in her eyes. Damned if I do, damned if I don't. Let me just add that I am 20 years old. She shouldn't be trying to make rules for me anyways. She lost that power when I turned 18. But for some reason in her stupid mind she thinks she still has the right to tell me what to do. Okay, I know I live under her roof. But I contribute the best that I can. But of course my best isn't good enough. It isn't good enough for anyone. I don't disrespect her in any way. I don't do illegal things in the home or even outside. But I'm just a shitty person and I can't do anything right in her eyes, apparently. She doesn't treat me with any respect, that's for sure. Oh God and don't get me started on how much she hates my boyfriend. And she has not one single legit reason to like him. He is very good to me. I guess it's because he brings me happiness that she doesn't like him.  And because she doesn't like him, she just degrades me and talks down to me all of the time. Take that back, she does that regardless. I don't understand why she can't accept the fact that she can't make my decisions anymore. And she should just leave me the fuck alone.  She could care less that she hurts my feelings on a daily basis. I can't wait until I can get on my own and away from her. I've considered just being homeless so I can get the hell away from her.  I'm sick and fucking tired of always feeling not good enough because of her."
do,"Hey Reddit. Ive been living alone for 3 years now and I’ve always been slightly nervous and always checking my upstairs to make sure no one is hiding up there. I’ve noticed recently, however, that I’m always checking for someone in my apartment, looking over my shoulder,  checking mirrors, keeping lights on at night, or imagining things that aren’t there. Certain shapes in my apartment appear human like and I freak out. I’ve never been this scared about it. I’ve always liked my isolation. Thing is I’ve also been very depressed recently because I’m graduating soon and I fell out with a very close friend so I feel like those factor in. 
Do you have any recommendations on how to not be so scared about living alone? Each day I feel like I’m losing my mind more or imagining more things. Anything helps! 

Forgot to mention I’m a girl. AND an only child, so being alone isn’t difficult for me since I spent a lot of my childhood alone."
do,"I looked for a snail mail penpal in the past but was unfortunately stood up  -very sadface-  However I am willing to give it another go, with some spice added!


I have posted a request on anonymouspals concerning a blog concept.  It fits that purpose more snugly, however, I really wanted to engage in both the blog and snail mail.  Basically, I am a greedy person and would like one of each &gt;:)

**Blog Concept**

EDIT: I found a penpal for this blog as well but I am still in the works on a multiple blog situation so, if you're up to it, comment or PM!

  In essence, the blog concept is more like a diary that only your penpal(s) can access (handled via blogger.com privacy options).  You'd write just as you would on a journal and the contents are completely independent of your pal(s).  Lots of variables go along with this idea.  We can choose whether to comment or not (I'd prefer to!) so that it has a penpalesque feel, we can have multiple pals involved or just us, and we can also choose to be anonymous or not.  Posts can be as frequent as you'd like, although I'd prefer at least weekly.  Sounds healthy.  Also, by independent, I mean the style can take your own personal form.  Casual, formal, third person narrative, or even in a story-like manner works so long as it is your life and your preference. 


~~**Snail Mail**~~

  Found a penpal!

My penpal is not limited in either option.  I don't mind anyone at all, so long as you're willing to stay committed and put up with my massive dialog :)  I'd love for this to be a lasting tradition.  You can be my neighbor or someone from across the globe, male or female, human or alien.  It doesn't matter one bit.

If you want a minor introduction on my part other than the title, I am a Computer Science major born and raised in Miami.  I just moved to the D.C./Maryland area about a month and a half ago, and even more recently moved into my new home as of a week ago.  Very stressful, especially when you toss in a new last-minute kitten added to my family of three, a week long engagement and last minute wedding!  I haven't stopped this year, but I'm thinking this weekend should settle it for a while.  I'm a second year student studying Computer Science with a secret passion for law.  Looking forward to applying for law school after I graduate.  The rest you have to figure out for yourself!

do,"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 20 ie three months ago. Before that, I had been failing college so I had been relying on some other people a lot for assignment help aka I was a fuck up. Most people in my major are very smart (as the admission score was high) and I think word has spread around that I have to rely on others for help like a toddler. In the past, I have noticed that this person who I used to ask for assignment help seem to be deliberately avoiding me.

I am still struggling in college but I am now seizing every opportunity that I have. I stopped asking people for help and managed to pass more courses and tests. A professor mentioned summer research opportunities in class so I went to a briefing session related to it.

During the briefing session, the professor mentioned how were supposed to do the computer analysis in groups of two. At the briefing session, I asked a person whether she wants to work with me and she said that ""she's still thinking about it"". Later another girl approached her and she agreed to group with her.

When I was leaving, it seemed like other people were walking away from me as fast as possible. It really seemed like that people in my major don't like me very much. Any advice as to how to find a partner for the lab work or should I just bail out?

I think that I have picked the wrong major and that I am a complete loser. I won't switch majors though as I am already halfway through the completion of the degree and I can always go to grad school to major in something else. I feel like everyone hates me and I just want to vanish from existence."

do,"I appologize in advance for the long wall of text!

I have developed some serious issues regarding masturbation. My SO and I have been together for a little longer than a year and have been living together for 8 months.  Up until recently, our sex life was amazing.  My new issues with his masturbating have changed that and I need help!!

When we first got together, his masturbating or looking at porn didn't bother me at all. It doesn't bother me when heappreciates beauty, whether its a sunrise or a naked human being.  In fact, we had a poster of a half-naked woman hanging in our bedroom for months witno problems.  I was not anti-masturbation.  I felt like it was a healthy thing to do and everyone did it.  We had an unspoken, mutual agreement that it was okay as long as it didn't affect our sex life. For a long time, it didn't and things were terrific. I guess that was just the ""honeymoon"" stage of our relationship. 

About 2 months ago, sex began to take a turn. We had been intimate at least once a day, every day, sometimes it was as much as 5-6 times a day. My SO's interest began to wane and he stopped initiating sex with me. When I was the one to initiate, it would take him a while to be responsive, then it began to take hours for him to finish, if he was able to at all. Previously, it would be less than 30 minutes, which was perfect for me.  He would also get really irritated when I'd ask him to stop after what seems like an insane amount of time because it started to hurt.  He would have a fit, telling me I was going to cause him to get ""blue balls"" and it was my fault he was going to be in pain.  I talked to him about it, concerned that he wasn't attracted to me any more, and it came up that he had been masturbating A LOT.  He lost his job in December and since then, really has nothing to do all day but sit around and wank.  When I told him that I felt rejected when I can't make him climax before he claims he's too sore to finish, he said he would stop masturbating and I had his word, his promise. 

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. It came up in conversation that my SO still masturbates rather frequently, almost on a daily basis. I felt cheated, lied to. When I asked him why he told me he wouldn't do it any more if he planned to just keep doing it, regardless of the impact if had on our physical relationship, he answered:  I just wanted you to stop bitching so I told you what you wanted to hear so you'd stop.

Now I feel as though nothing he tells me is the truth and he just says the things he thinks I want to hear. I also can't stop thinking about him getting himself off, looking at videos and pictures of women he finds more attractive than me.  It's a huge turn off for me and I don't find sex with him appealing at all. I can't get turned on by him and I find myself backing off of our relationship. I'm not sure what to do here!"

I can't talk to them about how I feel because they're busy since they started doing foster care. I so desperately crave the white walls of a phycological hospital right now. I crave to get away from everyone and everything that I know. With no more sound, no more fighting. Just a blank room with a blank mind.

do,"Hello, I got my spetum pierced one and a half years ago. It was a pretty bad pain, but only because its the tearjerking kind of pain, which is easily manageable to stay still during. Naturally I have a crooked septum, so to my unfortunate luck, the piercer pierced it straight through, and it was crooked cus my nose is, so we had to take it out and actually pierce it crooked to look straight on my face. It healed very smoothly with little to no problems. Only a brief infection which was gone within three days of cleaning. Now I've been waiting for this certain pain to go away but after more than a year I'm ready to ask questions. When I push even very slightly on the septum like straight back, it hurts so bad. Almost like a bruised pain. The only cause I could think of is that its pushing against my cartilage so when I poke or push the front part of my cartilage parallel to where the piercing is, it hurts like nose birth. I should tell you I have stretched it from the original 16g to now a 12g. But thats already healed as well and I did it very slowly from 16 to 14 to 12. Also this pain persisted even before I did this. So is my piercing too close to my cartilage? Or is it something else? (Not an infection, i would be able to tell.)"
do,"Hi! I'm interested in buying/ making something similar to something like the Kapkan hood or else like Crye Precision's Assault Ghillie (which I've heard gets caught on things and is made with weak webbing), the question is are these hoods actually viable, or are they a waste of money/effort?"
do,"How do you know when a relationship is over or when you're going through a rough patch?

Recently me and my boyfriend have been having a rough time. Well, rather I've been having a rough time, from what I can gather he doesn't seem to be having the same thoughts as me regarding our relationship.

I suffer from depression (this is a throwaway account I use for that, see my other post if you want some details about it). I realise that I can be difficult to be around at times. Mood swings, teary, not wanting to talk to/speak to anyone. But when I do want to talk to someone he just isn't there for me. I understand that 2am may not be the best time to talk, but I can't really time when I do and don't reach out to someone. He's the only person who I talk to about being depressed. I've told another friend but since then she just acts like the conversation never happened (which is understandable if you don't know how to deal with/approach the situation). However, I know I wouldn't be able to sleep if he was having a crisis moment. Am I being unfair?

I feels like he cares more about his friends than me; though again I don't know if I'm being unfair/clingy. I spent last Halloween with his friends (some of who I would consider my friends in the sense that I'd keep contact if we ever broke up). This year he was supposed to spend Halloween with me and my friends (who he gets along with - so thats not the issue); instead he went out with his own friends but still used my place to crash. Not so upset about this because it's Halloween (hardly a couples night) and I had a great night with my friends. 

I spent New year's eve with his friends so sort of expected him to spend this New year's with me and my friends (I was going a house party which his friends could also come to). His friends have half planned to go out to a local bar for New year's, but even when I told him about the house party he was still deliberating going out with his friends. It may sound petty, but I was quite hurt and when I told him this he was like 'fine, I'll spend New year's with you'.  I didn't really feel like talking much after this so I ended the conversation telling him I had uni work to do. I've always viewed New year's as if you have a partner, spend it with them; is my reaction uncalled for?

I also feel like we haven't had much to talk about lately; I can still have regular conversations with my friends but our conversations seem strained or non existent. We still have a normal sex life, but I'm beginning to wonder if it the physical contact and having someone there I'll miss or our relationship. 

I've never cheated and I would never do something like that in a relationship. I'm beginning to get a little jealous of my house mates who can go out and kiss/ bring back whoever they like, but not so much that I'd consider cheating. Question to older people: At 19 did you really know who you wanted to spend the rest of your life with? Or am I just getting a case of 'the grass is always greener on the other side'?

As far as Christmas goes, we have a spend limit, but I've only got one thing because I was planning on a trip away so would only be giving him a few things to open on Christmas day. I'm not sure whether I should book the trip or not.

I'm still unsure about the relationship so wouldn't break up just yet. I don't think I'd break up with someone right before Christmas either though. Any different opinions/viewpoints on that out of curiosity?

There are a few more issues, and obviously there are good points to the relationship too, but I'm exhausted and don't feel like typing more.

tl;dr Not sure whether to continue my 2 year relationship with bf because of several issues. Also not sure if I am blowing issues out of proportion.

I had to take a year off for physical health) at a Big Ten school (for those who don't know, it's a conference of large state universities, mostly in the Midwest US). I've had nothing to do and no one to do anything with, and I was diagnosed with depression earlier this semester. The last two nights I've drank alone in my dorm room because everyone else was out having fun, at date parties. It honestly makes me feel better for a bit, but I'm worried that I'm going to have a problem. Before this, I drank no more than 1-2 times per month, only heavily 2-3 times per year. I don't know what to do."

do,"He's manipulative. I've tried leaving before, many times actually in the last 2 years. I can't be weak again. I have to make this end. I've told him and I am gathering my things to move out. Keep me strong, Reddit. Last time he called me up crying, begging for a final talk. Asking ""how could I do this""? I gave in. When I met with him it was nothing but ""this is your fault, look at what you have done, I have made you and you disrespect me like this? You're nothing without me."" 

I have a fragile state of mind as it is. I have been beaten down with years of depression and anxiety and past relationships that were abusive. If I don't get out Reddit, this will kill me. I know it will.

EDIT: he's texting me now, accusing me of cheating on him and ""that's why I'm leaving him"" It's not true. I have been faithful since the first date. I have been forced to stop talking to ALL of my male friends when this relationship started because they were ""a bad influence and he could tell it was leading me to a path of tempation."" WTF."
do,"I was diagnosed with ADHD five months ago. I became depressed-like as I felt like that nobody around me could relate to my problems. They think that I am lazy and often shame me for my deviant behaviour. These days I am slowly recovering and feeling better and I naturally want to take part in more events.

I hence want to make ADHD friends. There isn't a single ADHD meetup group in where I live. I hence proposed the idea of starting an ADHD meetup group to my uni's disability office. The person in charge of managing this office suggested that maybe I should attend a meetup event organised by this student club first. The club is run by student helpers who assist students with disabilities so they will attend this event along with other students with disabilities themselves.

So I contacted that student club via FB. From the club's FB activity, it seems much smaller and less active than the other student clubs at my uni. They replied and told me the date and location of the meetup event. A few days before the planned date they also announced this event's date and venue location on social media again.

So I went to the venue location on the event date. When I reached the venue, there was no one. All I saw was a note which said that the meetup event was rescheduled to next month.

I was upset. I was hoping to make new friends as well as looking forward to this meetup event and they just rescheduled it without notifying me or the general public despite ""confirming"" this venue date a few days ago in social media. I get the feeling that this student club is relatively small and ""scattered"" anyway given how it updates its Facebook pretty infrequently and rarely promotes its events. 

I am disappointed with the way it is run and I guess the nature of that club is a bit ""disorganised"" itself. It seems like it has very  a few members and some of these  a members are kind of  inactive  When I found out that this club exists, I already thought that it was too good to be true that there are neurotypical people out there who are willing to devote their time to helping ADHDers (I think we all know how many people act like ""haters"" towards ADHDers or they just don't get what it is all about). Turns out that I am probably right. I feel like this student organisation only exists as my uni needs helpers like that and its lack of popularity compared to all these other volunteering student clubs kind of reflect society's attitude towards ADHDers and other people with disabilities. 

Sometimes I think we really have to develop a ""shake it off"" mentality to survive in the outsider world. I highly suspect that most people have some ingroup favourism instincts where they subconsciously (or consciously) prefer helping their own kind (so ADHDers as well as other people with disabilities are not on the priority list for people without disabilities. Oh well, I guess there is a ""survival of the fittest"" side to modern society. It's just the way things are."
do,"We broke up Friday night and it's completely my fault. I've been a bad boyfriend lately, going out with my friends when she's upset and needs me, not inviting her places and in general just not doing anything to make her happy. We've been together three years and it was amazing and wonderful up until about 6 months ago when it all went south. I did things I'm not proud of, I screamed at her drunkenly in public, I grabbed her by the shoulders and scared her and even after that I kept her in a room with me and wouldn't let her leave until she talked to me. Im so ashamed of all that, I've never done anything like it before and right after I turned to counseling for help and I thought I got better. I havent done anything like it since but I havent exactly made things better. We've had amazing moments since then that filled me with so much happiness and love, but in between all that we've been fighting over the small things almost every week. The latest fights were over me going out Thursday with new work friends without telling her before hand. When I told her I was going out I didn't tell her who with and she assumed it was with my normal group of friends and got upset I didn't invite her. The next day when I explained it to her she was still mad, because she was upset that day and I wasn't there for her that night. She told me then she couldn't do it anymore and I tried talking her out of it but in the end thought some space would be needed and left her alone. Now here's where I really fucked up. I made the stupid decision to go out with my friends Saturday night. At the time it seemed like a no brainer but in reality it was the dumbest thing I could do, I should've stayed home and tried talking to her but I didn't. She called me that night while I was out telling me to leave her alone. I sent her some drunken texts that night telling her if I was man enough id end my life, texts I didn't remember sending because I was so drunk. Yesterday she was working until 3, when she finished she called and asked if I wanted to meet up, I told her I couldn't because I spent all morning crying and I couldn't see her because I was heartbroken because of my own stupidity. The real reason was I wanted to let her go because I'm not good enough. She deserves better and she's given me so many second chances and I haven't done well with them and I continously hurt her over and over again. I told her that when she called me around half 8 last night. She cried and asked why I didn't come over to see her and try get her back, I told her I had to let go because I'm not good enough. I haven't talked to her since. I tried calling last night because I missed her voice but she didn't answer. I texted her saying that but I haven't gotten a reply. She was my best friend for 3 years. The person who kept me sane, who taught me how to love and what it felt like to be loved. She taught me to get out of my comfort zone and meet people. She showed me I was worth something and make me feel like I never thought id feel. I thought Id marry her and have kids but now I think if that did happen I'd just be holding her back. I just need someone to talk to. I told two of my close friends but they're not very helpful. I don't want to tell my family but cause my brother is expecting a baby any day now and I don't wanna bring that down. I'm so alone and I hate myself for what I did to her. I'm a horrible perosn

do,"*In the beginning, I have to warn you, that this is only my thoughts and they more likely have nothing common with those who're reading this. Content may be triggering, cruel and sad.*

So, I got to this point in my thoughts, that I realized, that if I would die today, no one would notice that. It's not some attention seeking post, it's just some fact that everyone fear the most. *If* someone could find my body, then he would notice that I'm dead. Some neighbor, or just a stranger. Also it would notice the police, the morgue workers and the person who would have to bury my body. This is all. No one would even remember that once I was alive. So.

I don't know what to tell about it.. I have complicated feelings about it. 

But you know what's the scariest thing in this? Few years ago there were people who told me that they loved me. Who told me that they cared. They even tried to help me. But how did they come to this decision to leave me in total loneliness?

I think I know the answer.

They buried me that day when they let me go. They realized that I'm already dead. That there's no hope left. They already learned to deal with this fact. It was painful for them. I saw their tears. But today they learned to live with me being dead in their heads.

No one would want to remember about you. Because it's so painful, that nobody wants to admit that you exist. They will deny till the end that they knew you. They will deny till the end that they loved you. Because this is what they are scared to admit even to themselves. And they will never overcome that fear, and they wouldn't want to."

My boyfriend, we will call him 'Nova' and I have been seriously dating for the last few years, but we've known each other 9 years in January.
I was diagnosed with a Borderline Personality Disorder a few months back, and he was supportive, we both knew I was fucked up somehow... But he's forgotten what that entails.
We broke up today, just an hour ago. He can't handle how I am to my best friend of over a year, we will call him 'Volf'. He is the only other person I have found, aside from Nova, whom understands a lot of what happens in my head. A valuable trait for a best friend. But Volf has admitted that he loves me. Think realistically with me a moment, how many guy friends have feelings for one of their chick friends? There are two choices: Never say anything and keep it uncomplicated, or say something, and possibly get friendzoned.

Volf did the latter, and was friendzoned. Nova has been uncomfortable but accepting and supportive of the friendship. Or so he said. He hasn't trusted me in a long time, for mostly unrelated reasons...

Look, I know that, while he is not faultless, this is mainly my own fault. I can't share 100% of the story with you, I'd be here forever. I have issues forgiving myself for even the tiniest of mistakes... But the last few months have culminated to the end of a relationship I fully expected to last forever, so I know I'll be taking this fuck-up hard.

I guess I just need stories, support... Anything?

do,"Born in VT (lived there at the time), live in NY now, and the school is in VA.

When I was 14 (8 years ago, 2009) I was sent to a therapeudic boarding school for ""trust issues"". I was locked up there for 2 years, with only 30 other same-sex students and a lot of condescending staff / staff with a façade personality. I spent these 2 years essentially self-learning to hide my emotions and to not attempt interactions in any form so as to avoid any possibility of having to stay more years, as well as to avoid staff there. There's a lot of other things I'd rather not go over about that place, but you can google and find probably a few cases similar to mine. Upon being released, the difference between before and after for both emotional and social interactions has a sharp difference in my memory. I was much more impulsive/reactive/emotional in middle school, and afterwards I barely smiled/cried/anything. In the years since I have been in automobile accidents (as a driver and passenger), been on fire, and gone through a few attempted relationships/breakups. The thing that relates all of these is that in all of these events I had almost no outputtable emotion regardless of what was happening. I never cried, screamed, or showed anger. The fire is used as an example because it seems like a case where even some form of voice use would be expected, but I didn't even open my mouth (as well as being something recent and on my mind).

My emotional isolation began with the school and the social isolation began coming out of it. The social isolation is a key component of my depression; It has cost me jobs (inability to produce volume of work), therapy expenses (depression, emotional dissociation), as well as at the time set me grades behind where I was academically. Since the school isn't inspected, there were cases where I would be ""learning"" (we had to teach ourselves) from 3rd/4th grade textbooks in the 9th/10th grade (despite already being above my grade going into the school).

What I'm asking here isn't really what legal action to take, but what kind of lawyer should I even speak to for something in this area? There are numerous cases similar to mine where kids were abused, uneducated, and other punishments which wouldn't fly in a public school (isolation, unnecessary physical restraints/bullying). Not to mention the constant psychological impact (e.g. you had to earn ""points"" and ""levels"" which gave you miniscule permissions to things like using the bathroom yourself and could be revoked back to level 1 for simple things, like being awake too late, after months of work)."

Four months ago I attempted to kill myself via overdose.  My attempt failed, obviously, because I was found by fellow soldiers and brought to a hospital.

Occasionally I find myself wishing I had never been ""rescued""  and I resent the people who saved my life.  I still don't know what's worth living for or why I should continue on.  I just know I won't try it again because I've already failed once at it."

However, Youtube completely ignores other channels who actively and habitually infringe on the fair use laws and guidelines. Isn't it possible for the content creators to band together in some sort of lawsuit against Youtube for their faulty algorithm that takes money from law abiding content creators and gives it to thieves?

So, I've recently been put on Wellbutrin, about a month ago, for depression, which is scaring me a lot.  But I'm not sure if my depression is the cause of my sadness with my boyfriend (and school, but that's another can of worms) or if the problems with school/boyfriend are causing the depression.

My boyfriend and I have been together 2.5 years, and we moved in together in May.  he moved across the country for it (I had gone to grad school across the country).  So, we are far away from any family support.  At that time I was *so sure* that we were going to be together for quite some time, I really was.  I'd never felt that way before.

Now fast forward about six months.  I want to end things with him.  It scares me to be with the same person since I was 21 (I'm 24) and he feels like he wants to be with me forever.  I do not feel that way anymore.  I don't feel the same way about him as I did.  At all.  As cliché as it is, I love him but I'm not *in* love with him.  

However, I don't know if this is all because of this depression shit, or real feelings.  Anyone have any advice? It would be so greatly appreciated.

TL;DR--is my depression causing me to not love my boyfriend anymore?"

For context, I do not live with my family anymore as I am at college, and I am without a car at the moment. My mom’s boyfriend (I’ll call him “Bob”) has been living with my mom and sister for five or six months, but as far as I’m aware this problem has only started happening recently. Whenever my sister does something remotely wrong in their eyes, my mom will ask Bob to give his opinion on it, which will amount to him ranting on and on about his own daughter “Sarah,” and comparing her with my sister. From what I can tell, he has no contact with her. I don’t know anything about Sarah except that she was/is a “troublemaker.” For example, today my sister missed a Driver’s Ed lesson because she felt sick, and Bob went off saying “Sarah used to pull this shit all the time,” etc, implying that my sister skipped out on purpose.

This has been happening more often recently, and my sister has told me that this makes her uncomfortable and “kind of scared.” She gets stressed easily and doesn’t do well with confrontation of any sort. She has tried to bring it up to my mom but it’ll just dissolve into an argument. She’ll dismiss it with “Bob’s just trying to get to know you.” (??) My sister doesn’t feel comfortable discussing it to Bob himself. She doesn’t like him at all, and I don’t know him well enough to form an opinion. So, is there anything she can do?"

do,"**Possible triggers in here if you're susceptible to contamination obsessions.**

Anyone else here obsessed with avoiding toxic chemicals?

This isn't my only obsession, but it is the one that has tormented me the most.

Chemicals seem to be an almost ideal OCD trigger. Ubiquitous, unavoidable, often undetectable. Easy to imagine in your food, on your clothes, in your home. Easy to look up sensationalized news on plasticizers, pesticides, and flame retardants, all of them neurotoxic, carcinogenic, poisonous — and it's all backed up by the latest scientific data.

This obsession really fucks with my head because it always seems so *true*. When confronted with an obsession, my impulse is to find a rational path to forgetting about it, yet all the resources available on any toxic chemical just seem to *justify* the obsession.

""The guy who made my sandwich also touched the thermal receipt, which is laced with endocrine disruptors. Probably touches them all day."" Pay for my sandwich, smile like I'm normal, go home, throw it in the trash because even if that sandwich isn't as bad as smoking a cigarette at least my OCD won't bother me about it all day.

I won't touch dogs because they have deadly flea poison on them. The dust in my house is loaded with flame retardants. I get self-induced nausea from ""brain damage"" if I catch the slightest whiff of car exhaust. I spent two weeks dehydrated because all water had ""lead"" in it.

And if any of this happens I have to spend hours researching whatever I was exposed to, sometimes performing complex (and probably incorrect) calculations to prove to myself that I can stop worrying about it. But no conclusion is ever good enough.

So, that's a little window into my world.

Curious to find out if there are any others out there with this ""chemophobia"" obsession. Maybe we can help each other out."
do,"I'm so sad. I had a relationship with someone who suffers from manic depression and anxiety for 2 and a half years. It's been such difficult times. I absolutely love this girl, but she is SO difficult to deal with. She becomes rude to me and pushes me to limits beyond my own breaking point. I've tried over and over again, I've even apologize when I know I shouldn't have to, just to bring her back. I try to be quite about the times she is so rude and blunt towards me, I try everything she says might wor to help her cool down. 
It's been a nightmare, a situation so close to emotional abuse. I feel so bad for letting myself fall into this situation, and yet, I feel like I want to text her.

And then I'm going crazy, so I call her and her voice.. like I'm the worst thing in the face of the earth, I kind of.... exploted. I confronted her. She exploted too. She said I didn't respect the fact she didn't want to talk about the ""drama"", and that she just doesn't want to hear from me ever again. She has been completely out of reach as of that moment.

do,"Let me get this off my chest, it's been quite a burden.

A few things to know first..

I'm part of the Early College Program. Essentially, this means I started to attend college full time (along with high school) at 16 years old. My parents put me in this program because it ensured that my college would be completely paid for by the state (basically a free associate’s degree). I am trying to pursue a career in business. Someday, I would love to own a business and create something that either helps other people or makes them happy in some way or another. It's a dream of mine. I was fine with being in the Early College Program because this ensured I would be one step closer to my long-term goals. I was getting my associates degree at an early age and would be given the opportunity to transfer to a university at a younger age also. The program only has a few select careers to choose from, and luckily they had a business program. However, it focused on advanced college accounting. Accounting does not interest me as a career path, and I have no interest in becoming a CPA or anything of the sort. I do realize that this is a stepping stone though and appreciated the knowledge that I gained from that class. It wasn't easy, in fact it was the hardest thing I've probably ever done. They weeded out a lot of students and it literally made me sick sometimes how long I would have to study and dwell upon the concepts and mechanics to achieve an A average grade in the class.

So keep in mind that this program lasts for two years. Fast forward to the second year (this year). I have taken many college classes, Accounting, Psychology, English, Ethical Dilemmas, Math, etc. (I could go on) and because I enjoy academics and take them very seriously, it wasn't impossible to deal with. I was able to get an A in every class, and was always striving to impress my teacher’s every day. I had already been dating a girl for almost 3 years, I made plenty of friends at school, my teachers loved me, my parents supported me- The future in general seemed bright.
Right, so as soon as I turned a senior everything took a turn for the worst.

As soon as I turned a senior, I started to have extremely painful chest pains. I was living with a pain in my chest/back for 3 days. Went to school, rode the bus, stayed up all night in pain-.. My parents were convinced it was anxiety or acid reflux and even though tums/antiacids did not help they insisted I just wait it out. They didn't want to take me there because we were in the middle of switching out insurance plans and they didn't want to pay a penny.

It was so bad that I (an 18 year old man) could not help but cry out in pain all night. Going to school and pretending everything was fine was impossible. I was asked by many people why I was spending most of my time in the bathroom. My parents made me take public transportation during this time (again, didn't want to drive me to school, didn't want to spend a penny) and had to wait outside for an hour and a half just for the bus to arrive. Then ride the bus for another 2 hours just to go back home and literally cry in pain. (I was also throwing up constantly)
I arrived at the hospital eventually and was then told I had gallstones, (one was apparently lodged into my gallbladder duct) and a serious infection was spreading through my body. Within hours I could have died, and they just had gotten me into surgery soon enough to save my life.

Despite this, I maintained a 4.0. Everything was still okay. (worked on homework at the hospital for a week despite being on pain killers and other medications.) Next semester rolled around the corner and I was back in the hospital again. I was laying on the couch when it felt like a brick had suddenly been thrown on my chest. I quickly got up and tried to calm myself down, but after a few minutes I was dizzy and had a pulse of over 200bpm. When I arrived at the hospital they couldn’t find anything wrong. They kept me overnight and basically said if any of this happens again come see us. I felt unsafe leaving the hospital, but I had no choice. The next day, sure enough, it happened again. I was taken to the hospital and they said they couldn’t find anything wrong with my heart. They labeled it anxiety. They were right about me being worried, I couldn’t go anywhere without feeling like I was going to have a heart attack, suddenly die- I was feeling symptoms I had never felt before. I’ve never been more scared in my life. I had to go to school. I never missed a day. I hid all my problems and nobody to this day knows I went to the hospital for this besides my parents. My parents insist I keep it a secret due to employers not wanting to hire me because of health reasons etc.

I went back to the hospital 7 times. Finally, I had enough. I asked the doctor if I could wear a halter monitor to track my heart activity over the course of a week. Guess what, they got the results, it wasn’t anxiety. I was diagnosed with a severe form of tachycardia. I have a board of cardiologists who I am under care with. They have me on medication for life. I can no longer be active without feeling pain, dizziness, and symptoms of a heart attack. I live in fear of attacks that happen on a weekly basis. These events created a drop in my GPA and my perfect 4.0 went down to a 3.2.

My teachers turned their backs, my friends often wondered why I acted strange, my parents were mad at me for not getting straight A’s, however, my girlfriend was the only one there for me. She helped me through a lot of this and was at the hospital one of the nights I was there.

Next semester came and I tried getting myself back on my feet. I had goals, and I was going to complete them whether I was going through shit or not. I stuck everything out and tried my best to get my grades up. One day a counselor explained a scholarship opportunity to me. It was a long shot, but they said it was worth trying. I filled out the application to the best of my ability, and applied for the scholarship. I was then greeted by the person running the scholarship and was told I made it. Made it to the interview stage, in which I had to give a presentation. Keep in mind at this point I was still scared about my health and was having panic attacks in between times where I was alone. (also, this happened and made things much worse.. https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/47hbtm/a_stalker_at_the_bus_station_turns_out_to_be_my/)

Well, my interview ended up going great and I didn’t win the full $5,000 I was hoping for (later come to find out I would had if it weren’t for the lower grades I had gotten during my time with the heart problems.) but I did win $500 and got invited to the award ceremony which was nice. But the fact that I missed out on a big sum of money that would have been incredibly beneficial to me fell through my fingers still nags at me every day.

Then my girlfriend broke up with me. I literally received a text message. It went something like this; “I don’t think we should be together anymore. You’re going through a lot of stuff right now and I don’t want it to affect my life. I want to achieve my own goals and you’re holding me back.” This came out of the blue. It was completely random.

I am broken. I feel extremely hurt. I’m lonely. I’m worried. I’m depressed. I’m exhausted. There is a lot more to this story than meets the eye, but I don’t want it to be too long. In short, a lot of my friends ended up leaving me because I was too busy with school and I basically sit around at home doing nothing. Its summer now, and I was just told I have to take summer classes. Not because I need to, not because I want to, but because my parents can’t stand me “sitting around”. (my parents are a whole different story but in short they are very controlling and strict with just about every aspect of my life.)

I want to conquer my goals. I want to strive to make a difference someday. But I could really use some encouragement right now."
do,"It was Mother's Day and my family and I were going to a café for brunch as a treat for my mum. (I will not name this café for privacy reasons, therefore I shall just refer to it as ""the café"".) It was understandably busy, as the Mother's Day rush spread through the suburbs like a virus, therefore I was unable to see the horror which awaited me within that cosy looking building.

When my family and I walked through the door, we were greeted by the loud buzz of other families spending time with their mothers. As we stood there, waiting for a waiter to take us to a table, I saw something bright yellow out of the corner of my eye. I turned to my left and saw a horrid sight.

Dozens of little yellow demons, all lined up on top of the coffee machine on the counter. They were dressed in ridiculous little costumes and stared at me with their evil, goggle-covered eyes. I tried to hide my rage which was beginning to boil within me as they smiled their empty smiles. I tried to look away from this disgusting display, but I was somehow drawn to its awfulness. It seemed so ridiculous. Why were there minions in here?

After 10 minutes, were finally given a table. However, as we were being led to our table, I began to feel ill. I knew my sudden sickness was caused by the horrible display I saw minutes ago, but I tried not to show it, as I didn't want to disappoint my mum on her special day. I ordered two hash browns to avoid making myself feel even worse (if that was even possible).

The next half hour was a breeze. I talked, laughed and joked around with my family as I masticated my hash browns. As time passed on, I seemed to forget about the exhibition of evil yellow creatures. However, when the time came to get up from our seats and pay for the food, the wave of memories and the feelings of the exhibition came flooding back and washed over my entire body, engulfing me in anger, sickness, confusion and disgust.

As we exited the building, I caught sight of a paper sign blu-tacked to the window. ""Follow us on Facebook and Instagram,"" it said above a disgusting yellow creature with a putrid smile plastered on its printed face. I stared at it in disgust before walking out the door, relieved to be free from the glare of those devilish beasts."

I have a CV which I just haven't really filled anything out on just yet aside from my name, I was hoping to get some advice on what I do need to put on or leave out such as personal statements/grades etc, I've just never been that 'good' at making a professional CV. 

Really just looking for a bit of advice here for someone who probably should of done this a lot sooner."
do,"Hi mua, I'm new here and I was just lurking when somebody mentioned Birchbox. I looked it up and it seemed really cool. Anyways, I just want to know how big their samples are and if Birchbox is a good investment. Please enlighten me?"

That's impressive"
do,"I'm not really sure what my deal is, I'm 21 F and very confused.
I'm attracted to men, so I don't think that that's the source of my sexual confusion. On the outside, I seem normal and people assume I'm ""normal"" and experienced because of the way I look. I get crushes on guys, I get attention from them, and I want to be physical with someone else, but something is holding me back.
I don't know if I have intimacy issues or something, but I've still never kissed anyone and even though I want to be intimate, I get freaked out about it in real life. I feel like I should have done things by now, so part of me is nervous and embarrassed about the guy realizing how inexperienced I am and thinking it's weird. So I'm scared my inexperience is a turn off and it's what is probably preventing me from actually getting any experience.
I've read about demisexuality, asexuality, and others and I don't know where I fall or if I fall into any of those categories. I'm just so confused and frustrated right now. I know that I want to have a connection with the person I'm with, and that there has to be a friendship and familiarity and respect and all that before I could consider anything... but I sabotage myself even with that. I've had a few friends who I really liked and could see myself being with them but as soon as they started showing interest, I would just get closed off and resist. I don't understand why.
I also feel like I think about sex constantly and I think I'm unhealthy. Sorry if this was ramble-y-- I don't know what my issues are or why I have them, so I would appreciate any insight, advice, anything!"
do,"So I'm a college freshman who's been struggling with properly taking care of myself lately. This morning I found out that my rice cooker had rice from approx. 2 weeks ago, that had gotten nasty as fuck. How do I get this thing to stop smelling like death? I like the device but I've been too busy to cook with finals and somehow forgot about it?"
do,"I cleaned my Kawasaki Er6f for the first time since I put her to bed for Winter.

Have a look at the [front wheel](http://i.imgur.com/bLDr5Ac.jpg) and [back wheel.](http://i.imgur.com/fg1gUTf.jpg) That dirt is very ground in; I used a pressure washer on the highest setting and holding it on one spot for about 30 seconds barely cleaned it off.

What would be the easiest (read laziest) way to clean these? Any products or tools you can recommend?

Regarding the back wheel specifically, it appears to be a lot of water resistant stuff on there, most likely chain lube being spattered across it. I don't want to spray WD40 all over it to shift the grease without other recommendations first. Wheel and everything.

Thanks in advance."
do,"I grew up with my mom slowly becoming a hoarder.  As a child I would always have a messy room because I was never taught to clean.  Now as an adult, I have increasingly started to hoard myself.  I still live with my mom and some rooms have her stuff, some rooms have mine.  But we differ in the fact that she doesn't mind filth and disgusting conditions, like mold and cat piss, etc.  That's the stuff that really bothers me.  I have a lot of junk and posessions, but I absolute hate filth.  Do you think my hoarding in this case is genetic or environmental?"
do,"Could someone please explain how Prilepin's table works for
Concentric exercises (pg 71 - 73 Overcoming Gravity). There is a lot of info there and I'm having a hard time understanding it."
do,"I am deathly scared of driving. I constantly think of how I am going to get into
1. A freak accident and kill myself or kill someone else
2. Get run over by a truck
3. Be paralyzed forever

 I have my G1 but not my G2 yet (Canadian). My parents and my younger brother do an excellent job reminding me everyday how worthless I am for still not having my driving license. 

Today I had to hear from my 19 year old brother how
- People like me are given so much opportunity yet we still dont take advantage of it.
- I should feel embarrassed and worthless that I am 26 and I still don't have a driving license.
- I have been apparently wasting my life away
- I don't have depression or anxiety and none of my doctors do not know what they are talking about. 
- He has been through exactly what I have been through. When questioned what he means by that, he clarified that because he has seen what I have been through he knows exactly what it's like. He doesn't need to experience it himself because he obviously already knows.
- I can't possibly have panic attack because he has never seen me go through one and the times I drove the car with him I did it fine without an anxiety attack.

What he doesnt know is I have lost count of how many anxiety attacks I have had in 2015 because there were way too many. What he doesn't realize is I go through immense mental agony trying to stop myself from having another panic attack in front of my family. 

Sigh my brother is an ignorant fool who has been spoiled and endowed by my parents. He is also excelling in one of Canada's top engineering program with scholarship and has an enormous ego on his shoulders. Because he is doing so well with life he feels he has the right to dictate/judge others decision despite the hardship they may have faced. He has a hard time grasping the idea of mental illness and often questions the validity of them too. 


A little background note about me.

I am 26(F). I have suffered from depression for over 6-7 years now. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and depression about 2 years ago. I was also diagnosed with anxiety, sleep paralysis and sleep apnea early last year. I used to be on several medications including effexor, clonazepam and cipralex which I just recently came off of. Its been an exhaustive and lengthy journey trying to understand,  come to terms with/accept and finally living with my illnesses. Aside from all this, I was raised in a very strict South-Asian religious household where they consistently emphasized on maintaining my reputation and modesty for the sake of family honor. My parents have been physically, verbally and emotionally abusive and that is a very light way of explaining the hell they have put me through. They do not belive nor acknowledge my mental health and claim I am just being mellow dramatic. Btw they have also tried to harrass/force/blackmail me into accepting arranged marriage proposals which induced my health problems further. 

On top, I was in several relationships that were equally damaging - physically, psychologically, verbally tortured and of course cheated on. Next to my health, my career suffered the most. I have been in and out of university during my undergrad, taking time off to cope with my health. But I took that time to get better and I worked my ass off so I could pay my tuition and pay for my personal expenses. 

I am back in UofT for my final year and I am really anxious about getting my degree. I recently got engaged to the love of my life. My parents have finally calmed down because my fiancée is someone they approve of and adore too. I finally feel like things are heading in the right direction. I'm scared but I am taking baby steps.

But my brother is a self-proclaimed ignorant teen asshole."
