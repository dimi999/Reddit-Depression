      " 'I know story going sound bullshit, I’m writing scare guys. I’m trying find people genuinely might know something honestly, I’m stumped. And I need help. This started almost year ago, summer 2017. I became friends— later July, partner of— boy named Marco. I’m still dating day, though I doubt that’s important. I’ve unidentifiable “condition” sorts since I kid got worse life progressed. I think I six years old; I would hear people call name I alone. Sometimes, would whisper right ear, sometimes, distant yell. As I grew older, false auditory cues turned weird visual hallucinations, usually night. I would make shapes didn’t exist, see wildfires lightning distance, wait animals cross street I driving disappear I focused them, things like that. They always disappear split second. Sometimes, I’m left wondering ever real (like lightning), sometimes, it’s obvious can’t possibly happen I don’t even question (for example, I saw giant eyeball open middle road). I’ve two physicians spoken two therapists, I never got true answer. Three four said stumped I told I’ve never touched drugs, one therapist blamed sleep pattern despite fact I get around eight hours sleep night. Looking back, I see hallucinations started getting really severe I met Marco around April 2017, though part understands why. Over summer, day I spent afternoon evening Marco. It completely normal— Dairy Queen, played video games, that’s it. When I went home, I sitting car dark. That’s I started hallucinating again. There figure standing trees. Its limbs elongated back hunched hell back. If you’ve played Until Dawn, picture wendigo’s body shape. It also long, pointed fingers (and presumably, also long, pointed toes. I’ve never seen feet before), empty eye sockets, lack hair, big smile sharp, shark-like teeth. It didn’t skin, instead looking like shadow, I don’t feel right calling “shadow-person” definitely wasn’t “person”. I get sounds straight twelve year old’s creepypasta, I’m willing present false information I’m trying figure fuckers are. Anyways, two things wrong I seeing. One: way disturbing nightmarish ANYTHING I’d ever seen. And two: matter long I stared, never disappeared. It kept staring me. I rubbed eyes see would help, moved closer car. I flashed high beams it, dissipated I made mad-dash house. Granted, I live wooded area, lot trees I could’ve mistaken I initially saw. But I started seeing everywhere: sides roads, sitting power lines, empty parks, backyard. The point is, way reoccurring anything I’d ever seen. It got point I needed tell someone. I felt like I finally going crazy, I needed kind reassurance. Of course, that’s I turned Marco. I texted I seeing shadow people, responded drawing accurate picture despite really vague description. While couldn’t see them, said could feel overwhelming presence nearby. He knew looked like ex-boyfriend could see them, too. They call “gristers”, though I’ve google image searched name typically find skin. Some pictures really capture I see them, though. Have similar experiences this?'\n",

I clicked links felt like I reading something typed robot. One friends said since positive links. That real bad ones shadows internet, like kicked side. Like hired people manipulate internet show good links promote \"Company\". I remember I used \\\\(Fiverr\\\\) something music, I saw could pay people like 5$ more, could manipulate internet, bots promote good. And \\\\(Googled\\\\) happy stuff came first search. After searching, like hours worth. I find real ones. It pretty hard find them. I get later on. So I writing this? I explain. To protect persons true name identity. I call \\\\(Jamie\\\\) since boys girls name. Jamie one family members. Now part household family, sibling wise. Jamie one day called up. Now I hear Jamie lot, know well. And \\\\(Facebook\\\\). Now I can\\'t recall word word phone conversation went. But I recall. It went along lines like this. Jamie \\\\- HEY! How you? Me \\\\- I normal I suppose. And you? Jamie \\\\- Cool! I fantastic! Me \\\\- Oh. Why so? Jamie \\\\- I glad asked! I special surprise! Me \\\\- Ah. What it? Jamie \\\\- It surprise! I can\\'t tell now. But everyone knows I surprise, I wait days I tell everyone, build suspense! Me \\\\- Oh. Why can\\'t tell though? Like masters college got into? Jamie \\\\- NO! Not yet! Okay! I tell you! Do ever feel tired wishing money? Me \\\\- Uh. I guess? I mean, money sounds nice. But I need tons happy. Jamie \\\\- I started business! Me \\\\- Wow really? How? You money.

And cannot quit me! You dedicated team! I cannot quitters! Me \\\\- Uhh... Okay hold up. Who 200$ go anyway? And honest would I pay anyone work? Jamie \\\\- You know? Why I even tell anyway?! I knew would interested! Me \\\\- Jamie calm okay? I know getting worked up. Jamie \\\\- NO! Right negative I need this! \\\\*Hangs up\\\\* Me \\\\- \\\\*Woah\\\\* Two weeks passed without talking Jamie. One day mother told family coming visit. At first I like oh okay. And point I totally forgot Jamies called business venture. I cleaned everything went market get foods big family dinner. When I returned I saw family already there. I got car greeted everyone smile. But I got Jamie, seemed cold smile back. A hours later Jamie called everyone living room. I kitchen cooking Father. My Father told go, busy take look. So I did. Jamie laptop open. And gave look. Like good one I think? I know. So sat down. Jamie opened power point. And started talking travel business. And everything came back me! After bit I got tired hearing all. I raised hand Jamie looked said \"Yes?....\" Me \\\\- Did make this? Jamie \\\\- No. Me \\\\- Where get it? It looks like something kid middle school made. My mom like elbowed little. I guess I came rude. Jamie \\\\- I think business. BUT I got man. My Mother \\\\- Where meet man? Jamie \\\\- At Starbucks. He really nice! My Mother \\\\- I see. Me \\\\- Wait. Did fall scammer? Like real life ones? Jamie Mother \\\\- If going rude Jamie maybe best go. My Father came said need continue. Jamie talking travel agency new deal. And makes 3 5 trillion dollars year. And get it. And I thinking, much war Middle\\\\-East? Gosh like I wanted stand go off, mother giving look stand start anything. Jamie went say \\\\- Who want make pillow money? Why someone go website travel I get money?!\\\\- And mom looked like \\\\- What happen Jamie?\\\\- So many red flags, I\\'m sure find PlanNet / Intele Travel \\\\- power point videos internet Facebook people talking it. It sad. It amazes Jamie side family losing critical thinking acting like morons. Like okay I get want help family hell. So hour something. Jamie finished. It waste time. Thank God got eat, awkward silence kind of. I set across Jamie. And felt like standoff Jamie. I whisper Jamie \"Look, getting scammed. Snap it.\" But work lol. It awkward afterwards. I try talking Jamie parents seem care anything. Jamie mother always odd smile I thought, like never smiles really like force weird smile? looks emotionally dead. Like lifeless soul. And Jamies Father attitude like care long everyone happy thing, matter right wrong. That side family different household family. The next day left. I got home work talked father since side family. He told understood felt way growing up. Apparently parents siblings stuff. But never fell believed dishonest unmoral. He says side family like ours, different beliefs twist Christian religion benefit ongoing crusade MLM. He told talk much, side family. When another years. But family. But chose life, nothing could do. And would best forget everything worry it. We cannot help them. He said try years kept burning bridges, His younger brother forgive death bed. And doubt sister would see reason. She\\'s far gone I believe saved . It shocking. Like I feel sad them. But I desire help see reason I guess? Everyone MLMs seems driven mad brainwashed . Like dark side ? After two weeks passed. Jamie like 200 something friends Facebook. Mostly us family Jamies friends. Then Jamie tagged something next day. And woah Jamie like 2k friends! Which people PlanNet Marketing InteIe travel people ... I like woah man. And Jamie business. And boss. And Jamie boss person entrepreneur. And travel agency. Which load blah blah. So I called Jamie. And went like I recall. Me \\\\- Hey, I know hate me. And think I destroy hopes dreams. But could give 5 minutes? Jamie \\\\- Make fast. Me \\\\- Were family. And since part family. I feel duty protect family. Jamie \\\\- \\\\*Sigh\\\\* Me \\\\- I called real travel agent. Actually I called least 3. And talk hour so. And told getting real. And back can. You make money. You taken advantage of. If really want start real travel agency, important go college get travel degree. Work real travel agency time, build rep etc. And maybe money saved loan open real place. You say business not. You boss. You answer company. Everything goes company. And license sell travel state, state. You can\\'t pay 200$ buy travel ID certification. You go months schooling state testing stuff. You said paid 200$ hour travel schooling videos gave ID card says independent travel agent. Also said pay 60\\\\-70$ month keep working them. Can\\'t see played? Jamie \\\\- Jamie snapped said rude things me. And hang me. I sent Jamie long text email everything laid out. With facts, money facts works everything. I spent hours gathering info I could. I felt like I presenting case court room. But that. Jamie said go away never talk again. Later father said Jamie goes MLM events now. And new significant goes part Jamies team 3 5. I guess Jamie got rid old significant other. And since I Facebook. I messaged them. We talked hour Facebook IM, Jamie basically ended everything S.O agree Jamie destroying relationship fast. I told wow I shock sorry. I hope find someone one day. After that, I shock. I talked mother said side family are, stupid stupid does. So I found videos PlanNet Marketing events, really weird. Like looks like night club event like church, people sing money, get weird rewards many people recruit. And strange. And everyone looks happy. Like maybe brainwashed happy? I know man. Like I want say Jamie fell victim, feel way. They seem really it. And plan come out. And since MLM big side family. It seems like side family continue MLM family tree. Unless one kids like father see stupid follow it. Anyway got point I tired see Jamies crap social media Pinterest memes Instagram feed. So I removed Jamie. I think notice care. I think I ever talk again. And I really like father side family anyway. They to...I know. I looked PlanNet Marketing Intele Travel. I found every recruiter also. They go poor neighborhoods college campuses churches malls food places. To pitch recruiting. And guess what? Every back ground check. Every court house I called police station government websites I looked in. Everything single thing I found. Left total shock. These people jail like crazy. Have sued people government like crazy. None really professional back ground business jobs! Like legit business jobs. A lot scamming people since 1980s/1990s still today. Many I found use gangs I think lot still are. It crazy. A lot call mentors success coaches stuff. And showing people light way. And every interaction opportunity make positive impact others. And level success determined level discipline perseverance. And empowering women men beautiful life. This one recruiter really twists exploits Christian religion MLM advantage. And makes mad. I know many fake Christians dishonest ones, I try best stay true everything I hold. At MLM event people say, discard people disbelieve business venture. And two different peoples world. ones believe ones not. And God want around them. And true normal Christian makes mad hear. That twisting everything. And making us look bad like radicals. They say never give keep it, stay it, could take years one day top like them. There much talk about. But twisted nonsense. And use God Holy Father MLM scheme, makes angry. A lot PlanNet Marketing / Intele Travel \\\\- African\\\\-Americans. And know, many category live poor lives. And I pity them. And wish best. Many great sane people good people. But bad ones them. And put shadows world I believe. I hope changes one day. Many white household wives husbands suburbs to. Many poor college people it. And many suckers too. When try debate them, block you. When start asking many questions block you. When start calling every red flag block you. Basically, them. Then them. Which kinda true I guess. PlanNet Marketing \\\\- Founder CEO Donald D Bardley. He vice president marketing \"Paycation\" home based travel scam. Mr.Donald sued many times U.S. Government. But since lot money, always able pay government sent prison. Yet. PlanNet Marketing promotes \"Intele Travel\" another home base travel scam. Also World Ventures another travel scam. And \"Pro Travel Network/YTB International, another home base travel scam. These Travel MLMs. When I talked Intele Travel PlanNet Marketing \\\\- They employees. No benefits, hours clock in. The way get money recruit people line. You hardly ever book anyone. Now I got info lot mind games person. And say book someone, get 10&amp;#37; booking split line. And say book someone 1000$ trip beyond rare, get 100$ something worth it. It pyramid travel scam. The defense give BBB \\\\*Better Business Bureau\" gives good reviews. But read reviews there, fake like bots fake stories. I think people post good stuff. And honest hard get profile BBB pay feed lol. Anyone it. Note profile BBB mean BBB accreditation. Note registered state GA man founders base is. Because try would get shut fast sued GA. They also seen legit \"Limited Liability Company\". All many red flags. You see income disclosure. It sad failure. Since PlanNet Marketing kinda new still. They really view public. But need be, true colors show. You guys welcome google youtube them. But NOTE people everywhere youtube google saying good things, real reviews real people shadows hard find.

I indecisive here, unusual me, I would love opinion this. **What played before?** I played Priest, Death Knight, Warlock, Shaman, Monk, Paladin, Druid 110 level. Rogue 65. **Describe liked disliked classes.** *Priest* - My first character. I love fantasy, class hall, character. I play Shadow Disc mainly. I like Disc healing spec, bonus healing spec Holy nice too. My biggest problem Priest movement, well lack demand damage Shadow has, well prevalence Warlocks. Also, character Argus reputation exalted, important. *DK* - My highest /played time. Again, I love fantasy. Everyone knows DK's biggest drawback movement, killer. I mind current content I farming old content transmog, achievements, stuff definitely feel it. I love unholy, like frost much simple. Blood nice too. This character Broken Isles reputations, well Blacksmithing Mining maxed out. *Warlock* - Warlock alright. Like DK, lot movement options (especially hurts PvP) exceptional healing (as affliction). This class really table me, pure DPS spec, makes LFG life little harder, less opportunity branch out. Also, I feel 'at home' Warlock, makes sense you. I know I want play warlock, least now. *Shaman* - Shaman intriguing class. I like state enhancement in, dislike state elemental (at least PvE, PvP basically insta glad). Resto touched, interested in. *Monk* - Windwalker fun lot damage, Brewmaster pretty fun mobile tanking spec, Mistweaver I played much all. This class I would like one alts. Also legendary ring grants chi orbit garbage annoying ability lmao. I like movement class. *Paladin* - My freshest 110. I leveled friend level 1 got WoW. I played paladin (in WotLK) keep hearing ret wheelchair spec, I definitely really want play protection (would rather play blood/brewmaster) open Holy. I really lot say class feels choppy. *Rogue* - Level 65, really enjoyable. I find stealthing past everything awesome, yeah thats pretty much I can't really say much class like I said 110. *Druid* - Don't really like druid much. Balance pretty fun I guess. Not contender though important list I dislike: Feral lot buttons, I know pretty weird considering I like windwalker unholy I get satisfaction spec I others. Resto fine I prefer priest healing specs. Bear cool, I like Blood more! Its odd, I feel druid jack trades, master none, finally (at least me). **With friend alone? What's friend going leveling?** I always play 1-2 friends, I would like main self sufficient. That's problem now-a-days anyway though. **Will primarily raids/dungeons level cap (PvE) knocking opposing faction balls flag (PvP)?** Definitely primarily Mythic+, LFR/Normal/Heroic raid, Arenas, order. Not really planning raid progression. **Heals/tank/DPS? What's style DPS - melee ranged?** I like three, I would like main melee dps spec. It allows juicy demand damage. **Any favorite game mechanics? (DoTs, HoTs, stealth, mana, etc)** Instantaneous damage would nice have, though, I really preference here. **Hybrid pure? Does matter?** It matters, main. It must least one tank one healing spec. For two alts, pure DPS fine. **Pet temporary pet none all? Does matter?** It matter much me, I like mechanics unholy pet brings table extra grip stun. **Final Notes:** Thanks sitting that, pretty therapeutic write out. I looking main two alts play rest legion, achievements stuff on. If I continue bouncing around characters rest expansion I know I going get anything done, pretty annoying.

      " 'With upcoming match mousesports Team Liquid later today, dive paths point ESL Pro League Season 7 Finals recent history seems like good use time. Each paths characterised running opponents worse losing better squads. The last two times met, StarSeries Season 4, traded maps series mouz came top semi-final went win event Natus Vincere. This time, teams duke quarterfinal see face Na’Vi semi-final. Who think make top? I give thoughts here. **mousesports** In tournament, mouz first encountered Sharks handed Sharks first defeat international stage Inferno, albeit smoothly could expected mouz. A missing ropz played part this, oskar played level pulled home win. Their next opponent NRG, team fire online recent times, proved potent adversary, yet mouz would pull two map wins Cache Nuke. This time, ropz would topfrag across series played huge part beatdown gave NRG Nuke. Across series, oskar, suNny ropz would perform trio should. In next series, mouz met FaZe, recent champions IEM Sydney, proceeded lose disparaging fashion. While would great performance, yet lose, first map series, Overpass, would get teeth kicked next map, Mirage. FaZe strong Mirage, know. However, Mirage mouz’s strongest map losing 16-4 STYKO topping scoreboard would make anyone’s hope plummet mouz. Suffering defeat FaZe’s hands would send mouz lower bracket Group A. Here, would face Heroic, newly formed Nordic version, suNny would make abysmal performance series FaZe, time topfragging Cache Mirage. His performance would prove especially critical Mirage, home map, would win close fashion, 16-14, thus granting spot quarterfinals. **Team Liquid** Team Liquid, group, clashed Australian squad Grayhound first match tournament. Where mouz bit dicey first matchup, Team Liquid could best described clinical. EliGe would bring hammer crush Grayhound Cache, leading Liquid dominant win. In next matchup, Liquid met team Space Soldiers looking great form, collapse Dreamhack Marseille. Missing IEM Sydney due visas seemed put fire belly Turkish team, yet Liquid would douse flames quench hopes strong finish event. Surprisingly, TACO players would topfrag along NAF across series, leading analysts speculate TACO ‘unleashed’ coldzera-hand-holding days. Liquid would find solid win Mirage, albeit one come-back Space Soldiers mounting second half, cruise second map, Inferno. With team looking high spirits, would move next matchup, time favourites, Astralis. With amount firepower prowess Inferno Liquid has, one would hope, maybe even assume, matchup would least go three maps. This would case form Astralis currently in. On Nuke, Astralis would comfortably grind T-side comfortable lead going second half. The second half would follow suit, Team Liquid’s T-side dismantled efficiently Astralis. Going Inferno, 10-16 scoreline Nuke Astralis might let Liquid fans get hopes up. For Liquid fan case, I feel sorry. On Inferno, Twistzz would find ace first pistol round, would nothing lost following round went lose 7-16, despite winning pistol rounds. As known happen playing Astralis, looking Virtus.Pro, dreams get shattered. However, loss end tournament, simply sent quarterfinal matchup mouz. **Recent History mousesports Team Liquid** A little less three months ago, StarSeries i-League Season 4 going event, Liquid mousesports played two best three series. In first, Liquid managed pull win 2-1, losing Train overtime subsequently winning Mirage Inferno close fashion. In second series, mouz managed win comfortable Mirage, get shit pushed Cobblestone return win without much trouble Train. **The Map Pool** Looking map pools evolved worked since then, interesting see incorporated Dust2 adapted Cobblestone pool anymore. Now Dust2 map pool Liquid lost beloved Cobblestone, map pool experienced changes. Despite played Dust2, appear afraid map, Astralis chose ban Cache Dust2. Against Space Soldiers, would ended Dust2 final map series gone three maps. Similarly, mouz foregone banning opposed leaving Train versus Heroic banned them, case series FaZe NRG. As result, might third map series, go far. The first two bans play done past, Liquid banning Nuke, arguably mouz’s second best map, mouz banning Overpass play it. With way, Mirage pick mouz obvious choice might best team map world. This leaves Liquid couple choices. They could go best map, Inferno, try leave third map, hoping mouz ban it. In second series StarSeries mouz banned it, Liquid probably pick it. This leaves Train, Cache Dust2 remaining maps pool. Depending bans first, likely see one two outcomes. If Liquid bans first, likely ban Cache StarSeries, leaves mouz option pick Train Dust2. While Dust2 something left every time far tournament, Train map series Liquid StarSeries. Train likely choice, stylistic team compositional advantages mouz Train opposed Dust2. If mouz bans first, likely still see Dust2 ban perhaps even Cache, making sure play either Dust2, may prepared well, Train previous times teams met. Neither team played Train Dust2 tournament, viewer, fingers crossed see either two. **The Matchup** Stylistically, teams looking quite similar. They IGLs chrisJ nitr0 previously roles ended role necessity, desire role. On surface, teams play loose individualistic, yet characteristic bit tricky apply. On one hand, mouz tendency play aggressively teams, especially T-side, often catch CTs off-guard playing T-side. Their T-side seem erratic, yet good amount teamplay firepower behind aggressive plays. On hand, Liquid play slower pace Counter-Strike structured T-side, often going defaults working there. Similarly mouz, play well end, skill-focused teams, opposed tactical teams. In terms individuals team, large discrepancy quality AWPers team. Liquid several hybrid players, nitr0 using primarily. On one hand, nitr0 looked average far tournament. On other, oskar arguably best performing player mouz hitting shots AWP. Taking account, well fact mouz stronger double-AWP setup Liquid, mouz definitely holds advantage Liquid aspect. Despite this, looking Liquid performing players rifles, definitely looks dangerous maps like Inferno Dust2, maps characterised amount mid-range duels fight takes place at. In terms firepower, teams similar three strong players NAF, Twistzz EliGe one side oskar, ropz suNny other. Both teams supportive player TACO STYKO IGL times, yet often, frag. **Prediction** With pick/ban likely play out, see Inferno, Mirage Train/Dust2 three maps. Interesting note mouz Astralis OT Inferno IEM Sydney Liquid Astralis Mirage Dreamhack Marseille. So either team’s map pick something play, play well. This series could quick 2-0 either side teams looking. At side time, could close 2-1 series teams winning other’s map third map playing map neither team played far tournament. That probably great match tune into. There clear favourite, two similar time different teams maps something middle pool teams good on. My guess winner would mouz, yet I sincerely hope NA CS Team Liquid pulls together manages make work.'\n",

My best friend 10+ years, grown me, great giving honest opinions I correct I say family members miserable, sad people, I harsh (hint: thinks miserable, sad people fault). Short background issue?..: Ever since I remember, parents bad relationship. I remember seeing kiss once. I\\'m sure stayed together kids, mother afraid alone always hoped dad would make good money again. I think feels stuck. I\\'ve normally always able handle rainstorm relationship- \\'it is\\' kind way. But I small family, one set grandparents. Now grandparents Assisted Living Facility dying, causing SO much negative energy around us. I mother father, one younger sister, one set grandparents[late 80s], one aunt uncle[late 60s], two older cousins 30s. Everyone family always negative. There never happy day house I lived there, still I back here, visiting two months. They never smile, talk other, even house always dark- like turn lights on. They claim cannot afford go therapist, instead thing every day, dark house (they draw curtains closed even beautiful day out, like today!). They speak nicely, I\\'ve learned healthy relationship trying NOT like them. Ok. Let\\'s start mom. This THE longest one, short, I promise. :) Mom: My mom grew abusive household. She youngest like 8 kids, says know even born father, mother always different boyfriends. She always vague answers exactly abusive. My sis I, growing up, always tried prying exactly happened kid...what heck terrible talk anyone anymore? I never met mother\\'s parents, I even know names. Her mother died I around 10 I think. Of family, went funeral. Also, father recently died- able go funeral one told (her father left mother mom young. He got remarried, years later tried getting touch sister I. My mom gave letters sent us, I personally refused write back abandoned mom little. My mom found died, ONE sister still keeps touch found Facebook died. His new wife (the one married left mom\\'s mother) tell \\'other\\' kids (my mom siblings) funeral. When mom 13, ran away, siblings moved house. The police found years later, tried bring back mom, mom\\'s mom said \"if bring back I\\'ll kill her\" mom went foster care. If seen movie White Oleander, daughters journey Foster Care families exactly like moms (as mom said). All bad, abusive, etc. She moved last one 18, never much money, spent 10 years graduating bachelors cuz afford live go school. Met dad 30s, got married, two kids. When I growing up, mom always anxious person. My sister I used jokingly make fun her, always afraid us \\'getting raped\\'. We allowed anything. She strict went- \"my mother very, scared something happen us\" kind way. As teenagers, reason go concert young, \"would get raped\". Things like that. Now, adult, I see joking matter, I know always fear. She would always jump 0-100 anything. If fell, would scream. I became dramatic teenager, sister I developed severe anxiety. We constantly afraid anything. My mom sick sense humor, sarcastically jokes grew always thinking worrywart, turns anxiety. \"Whoops!\" She\\'ll say. My sis I told get therapy, always makes excuse to. Also, mother made clear us, father, married wanted kids good job. She wanted stay home mom, blamed fact ended work, REALLY blames 60s sole provider household. She always \"hated job\", every job ever had. She always encouraged sis I marry rich, way would never work. Surprise surprise- sis I love working Human Rights sector love working learning. But teenagers, always impressed boy drove nice car. Or good town. Her reasoning behind \"Marry never worry thing!\" I guess I\\'ll also say I feel like always takes peoples problems, makes problems. When sis actually came Lesbian, mom blamed said sis bullied school mom enough stop it. When I diagnosed Tourette\\'s Syndrome child, mom thinks fault apologised entire life (it NOT affect life whatsoever! I lightly. People even know unless I tell them.) My mom blames father problems, blames childrens problems. All life I\\'ve always heard say \"This I wanted life be\". My analysis: I think, bottomline, mom gotten therapy got married kids. I think sis I developed issues growing her. Looking back childhood adult eyes, I realise overreacted issue sis I had. I got mad I go friends, threw ground, started pounding floor fists (exactly like toddler) cried. It really scared me. It like never expected teenagers difficult. Sometimes I blame issues, sometimes I blame issues growing up, sometimes I feel fault child trapped adults body, never got grow up. Dad: Dad loser. I love dad, he\\'s loser. I always went back forth whether I thought shitty dad not, I realize always great dad, bad husband. My dad never says anything bad mom. To day, says loves her, I\\'ve never heard mom say dad. He always says mom SUCH good mom, loves us. Constantly praises her. Once I younger, I woke fighting morning, yelling mom, saying \"You even hold hand anymore!\". Now, dad also hates working. He lost job economy crash I younger, ever since hold job. I grew realising that- I thought dad cool jobs. He bartender, worked concert venues, invested Start-ups, worked lot blue collar jobs teenagers worked. He makes mad, he\\'ll try open me, tell hates working want anymore. Yet day, he\\'ll tell mom can\\'t WAIT start working looking jobs day. Additionally, I\\'ve learned kiss-ass gullible (finally I know I got from!). He always thinks something good deal, easy fool, gets way excited possibilities of...any potential job/scenario could bring lot money. My father dreamer realise dreaming rudely woken up. He also BAD temper tries solve anything yelling. He\\'s fired saying \\'Fuck you\\' boss. When parents found I watching porn teenager, screamed foamed mouth (it was, course, spit! He busy yelling I think remembered take breath swallow), threw chair across room. He never hit me, I bet mom let him. He shook hard before, tapped fingers head hard asking \"What thinking?\" My dad raise voice, screams. If phone kind customer service, \\'spiel\\' sorts does, thinks get best service belittling person end line, yelling, calling stupid, asking speak manager. Its gotten point I know he\\'s going say next. Sis: Sis okay, now. And I say cuz I faith her. She always issues growing up- apparently raped (forgive me- I say \\'apparently\\' lied lot I get part soon!), came bi teen, came Lesbian. She lot drugs, anymore. I really think ever addicted- I think experimented. She always great school, went good college, graduated almost top class, working waitress nice little hip city, cute apartment, trying find real work. She says happy may try find real job anytime soon. This concerns mom, much dad (that\\'s typical). But I feel great, she\\'ll get real job ready. She\\'s smart lazy. My sis first went psych ward 16. I college one told me. She threatened kill herself. Did thing year later. She finally told parents raped, mom said fault(my mom said MOM\\'s fault). She diagnosed depression, meds 17. She still drugs, despite anti depressives. She snuck lot, lief lot, stole sometimes. Then, college, self diagnosed manic depressive. Recently, college psych properly diagnosed Bi Polar disorder. I see it- I feel psych course knows I do. My sis hoping get mood stabilizers soon. Growing up, always combative would threaten kill mom let hang friends, buy something. I always felt knew take advantage vulnerable mother- afraid sis killing would give give whatever wanted. (An ipod, new clothes, haircut). My sis I barely speak, I think that\\'s faults. I hated I growing caused much drama house, I refused speak her. So I think got used it, became \"our way\" other. It\\'s getting better now- I\\'m immature, I feel becoming...healthier. I really faith healthy future together. Her I even get together sometimes talk parents try figure together. I really appreciate that- makes feel like we\\'re figuring puzzle childhood, something alone. I still think I give time though, still needs get handle emotions. She still go 0-100 quickly, like dad. But I faith change I know I still like I 22 well. Me: Sometimes I think I\\'m great life, times I think I\\'m loser well. I never family supports I do. They willing let fall back needed (which I never, far) never tell I\\'m good. Basically, I grew REALLY angry, yet walked eggshells around everyone home. I\\'ve never able talk parents emotional stuff, can\\'t handle it. Mom either freaks out, dad yells. I go advice boys anything. I always felt guilty anything- bad tests, grades, saying something would make mom go lay bed day, alive, anything. Then, I wanted travel see world. I wanted go high school, college. Mom talked it, saying dangerous I\\'d get killed. I graduated college, went anyway (Still, thing I regret life NOT travelling right highschool. I would different life route.) I\\'m going get miserable unsupportive family travelling college- basically I talking guy online (dangerous, yes.) lived another country. He helped get job, apply visa, I went.

My father primary account, notification sent I removed. He either receive it, removed without telling me, care enough contact issue; I rightly care way look it. When I went make appointment refill paxil, I notified I longer covered, result, actually able see psychiatrist.

It feels like electrical shots running brain, particularly eyes change focus focal planes. It\\'s almost though I feel brain focusing, hear static noise inner ear eyes move. In time paxil ran out, withdrawals started, however, I realized I felt better nearly every single way I paxil. I motivation things, I felt better general, people noticed I different person whole. Since covered insurance, i\\'ve since decided I wanted stop taking paxil. I talked psychiatrist it, unsupportive decision, strongly encouraging remain paxil. so, i\\'ve take upon wean it. It\\'s process that\\'s ongoing roughly five months, far longer literature subject outlined. I\\'ve reducing half doses. The pills 20mg, i\\'m 50mg, meaning two half tablets every day.

I\\'ve every three days three weeks, completely stopped taking week ago. every day once/3 days, I began notice withdrawal symptoms coming back, mild. I means feeling fantastic, I could manage day-to-day. Since completely stopping, withdrawal symptoms come back en force, feels identical I went cold turkey. It\\'s obvious body developed dependency paxil, i\\'m determined break it. I want feel better, I want better place, I want place paxil help get, apparently holding back from. Starting paxil absolutely destroyed metabolism well, Prior starting it, I roughly 4k calorie diet maintain weight, I active. Since going it, i\\'ve cut less half i\\'m still gaining weight. I\\'ve gone 181 220 current weight. numbers include muscle mass loss fat gain. My activity dropped; I work anymore, I run, I exercise general i\\'ve lost desire so. So questions come here: 1. For withdrawals, manage them? coping mechanisms believe may help? I\"m expecting one-stop fix, i\\'m sitting typing this, i\\'m \"electrical\" feelings brain.
